LIST-INDEXES()                                                  LIST-INDEXES()



NAME
       list-indexes -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  list of all of the indexes in Amazon Web Services Regions
       that are currently collecting resource information for Amazon Web  Ser-
       vices Resource Explorer.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-indexes is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Indexes

OPTIONS
       --regions (list)
          If specified, limits the response to only information about the  in-
          dex in the specified list of Amazon Web Services Regions.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --type (string)
          If  specified,  limits  the  output to only indexes of the specified
          Type, either LOCAL or AGGREGATOR .

          Use this option to discover the aggregator index for your account.

          Possible values:

          o LOCAL

          o AGGREGATOR

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list the AWS Regions where Resource Explorer has indexes

       The  following  list-indexes  example lists the indexes for all Regions
       where Resource Explorer has an index. The response specifies  the  type
       of each index, its AWS Region, and its ARN.

          aws resource-explorer-2 list-indexes

       Output:

          {
              "Indexes": [
                  {
                      "Arn": "arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-west-2:123456789012:index/EXAMPLE8-90ab-cdef-fedc-EXAMPLE11111",
                      "Region": "us-west-2",
                      "Type": "AGGREGATOR"
                  },
                  {
                      "Arn": "arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-east-1:123456789012:index/EXAMPLE8-90ab-cdef-fedc-EXAMPLE22222",
                      "Region": "us-east-1",
                      "Type": "LOCAL"
                  },
                  {
                      "Arn": "arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-east-2:123456789012:index/EXAMPLE8-90ab-cdef-fedc-EXAMPLE33333",
                      "Region": "us-east-2",
                      "Type": "LOCAL"
                  },
                  {
                      "Arn": "arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-west-1:123456789012:index/EXAMPLE8-90ab-cdef-fedc-EXAMPLE44444",
                      "Region": "us-west-1",
                      "Type": "LOCAL"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Indexes -> (list)
          A structure that contains the details and status of each index.

          (structure)
              An index is the data store used by Amazon Web Services  Resource
              Explorer  to hold information about your Amazon Web Services re-
              sources that the service discovers. Creating an index in an Ama-
              zon  Web  Services Region turns on Resource Explorer and lets it
              discover your resources.

              By default, an index is local , meaning that it contains  infor-
              mation  about  resources  in  only the same Region as the index.
              However, you can promote the index of one Region in the  account
              by calling  UpdateIndexType to convert it into an aggregator in-
              dex. The aggregator index receives a replicated copy of the  in-
              dex  information  from all other Regions where Resource Explorer
              is turned on. This allows search operations in  that  Region  to
              return results from all Regions in the account.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon resource name (ARN) of the index.

              Region -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Region in which the index exists.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of index. It can be one of the following values:

                 o LOCAL   The index contains information about resources from
                   only the same Amazon Web Services Region.

                 o AGGREGATOR  Resource Explorer replicates copies of the  in-
                   dexed  information  about resources in all other Amazon Web
                   Services Regions to the aggregator index. This lets  search
                   results  in the Region with the aggregator index to include
                   resources from all Regions in the  account  where  Resource
                   Explorer is turned on.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If present, indicates that more output is available than is included
          in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken request pa-
          rameter  in  a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part
          of the output. You should repeat this until the  NextToken  response
          element  comes  back as null . The pagination tokens expire after 24
          hours.
