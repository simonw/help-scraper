NAME
       describe-broker -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about the specified broker.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-broker
          --broker-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --broker-id (string)
          The unique ID that Amazon MQ generates for the broker.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              (string)

          RoleBase -> (string)
              The  distinguished name of the node in the directory information
              tree (DIT) to search for roles or groups. For example, ou=group,
              ou=corp, dc=corp, dc=example, dc=com.

          RoleName -> (string)
              Specifies  the LDAP attribute that identifies the group name at-
              tribute in the object returned from the group membership query.

          RoleSearchMatching -> (string)
              The LDAP search filter used to find roles within  the  roleBase.
              The distinguished name of the user matched by userSearchMatching
              is substituted into the {0} placeholder in  the  search  filter.
              The  client's  username is substituted into the {1} placeholder.
              For example, if you set this option to  (member=uid={1})for  the
              user janedoe, the search filter becomes (member=uid=janedoe) af-
              ter string substitution. It matches all role entries that have a
              member attribute equal to uid=janedoe under the subtree selected
              by the roleBase.

          RoleSearchSubtree -> (boolean)
              The directory search scope for the role. If set to  true,  scope
              is to search the entire subtree.

          ServiceAccountUsername -> (string)
              Service  account  username.  A  service account is an account in

              (DIT) to search for user entries. The subtree is specified by  a

              by setting this option to ou=Users,ou=corp, dc=corp, dc=example,
              dc=com, the search for user entries is restricted to the subtree
              beneath ou=Users, ou=corp, dc=corp, dc=example, dc=com.

              The client's username is substituted into the {0} placeholder in
              the  search  filter.  For  example,  if  this  option  is set to
              (uid={0}) and the received username is janedoe, the search  fil-
              ter becomes (uid=janedoe) after string substitution. It will re-
              sult in matching an entry  like  uid=janedoe,  ou=Users,ou=corp,
              dc=corp, dc=example, dc=com.

          UserSearchSubtree -> (boolean)

              ou=corp, dc=corp, dc=example, dc=com.

          RoleName -> (string)
              Specifies  the LDAP attribute that identifies the group name at-
              tribute in the object returned from the group membership query.

          RoleSearchMatching -> (string)
              The LDAP search filter used to find roles within  the  roleBase.
              The distinguished name of the user matched by userSearchMatching
              is substituted into the {0} placeholder in  the  search  filter.
              The  client's  username is substituted into the {1} placeholder.
              For example, if you set this option to  (member=uid={1})for  the
              user janedoe, the search filter becomes (member=uid=janedoe) af-
              ter string substitution. It matches all role entries that have a

              by setting this option to ou=Users,ou=corp, dc=corp, dc=example,
              dc=com, the search for user entries is restricted to the subtree
