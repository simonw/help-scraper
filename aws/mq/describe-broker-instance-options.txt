SYNOPSIS
            describe-broker-instance-options
          [--engine-type <value>]
          [--host-instance-type <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--storage-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --engine-type (string)
          Filter response by engine type.

       --host-instance-type (string)
          Filter response by host instance type.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of brokers that Amazon MQ can return per page (20
          by default). This value must be an integer from 5 to 100.

       --next-token (string)
          The token that specifies the next page of results Amazon  MQ  should
          return. To request the first page, leave nextToken empty.

       --storage-type (string)
          Filter response by storage type.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
