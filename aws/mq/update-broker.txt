       --auto-minor-version-upgrade |  --no-auto-minor-version-upgrade  (bool-
       ean)
          Enables automatic upgrades to new minor versions for brokers, as new
          versions are released and supported by Amazon MQ. Automatic upgrades
          occur during the scheduled maintenance window of the broker or after
          a manual broker reboot.

          The unique ID that Amazon MQ generates for the broker.

              Required. The unique ID that Amazon MQ generates for the config-
              uration.

          Revision -> (integer)
              The revision number of the configuration.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Id=string,Revision=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Id": "string",
            "Revision": integer
          }

       --engine-version (string)
          The  broker engine version. For a list of supported engine versions,
          see Supported engines .

       --host-instance-type (string)
          The broker's host instance type to upgrade to. For a  list  of  sup-
          ported instance types, see Broker instance types .

       --ldap-server-metadata (structure)
          Optional.  The  metadata of the LDAP server used to authenticate and
          authorize connections to the broker. Does not apply to RabbitMQ bro-
          kers.

          Hosts -> (list)
              Specifies the location of the LDAP server such as Directory Ser-
              vice for Microsoft Active Directory. Optional failover server.

              (string)

          RoleBase -> (string)
              The distinguished name of the node in the directory  information
              tree (DIT) to search for roles or groups. For example, ou=group,
              ou=corp, dc=corp, dc=example, dc=com.

          RoleName -> (string)
              Specifies the LDAP attribute that identifies the group name  at-
              tribute in the object returned from the group membership query.

          RoleSearchMatching -> (string)
              The  LDAP  search filter used to find roles within the roleBase.
              The distinguished name of the user matched by userSearchMatching
              is  substituted  into  the {0} placeholder in the search filter.
              The client's username is substituted into the  {1}  placeholder.
              For  example,  if you set this option to (member=uid={1})for the
              user janedoe, the search filter becomes (member=uid=janedoe) af-
              ter string substitution. It matches all role entries that have a
              member attribute equal to uid=janedoe under the subtree selected
              by the roleBase.

          RoleSearchSubtree -> (boolean)
              The  directory  search scope for the role. If set to true, scope
              is to search the entire subtree.

          ServiceAccountPassword -> (string)
              Service account password. A service account  is  an  account  in
              your  LDAP  server that has access to initiate a connection. For
              example, cn=admin,dc=corp, dc=example, dc=com.

          ServiceAccountUsername -> (string)
              Service account username. A service account  is  an  account  in
              your  LDAP  server that has access to initiate a connection. For
              example, cn=admin,dc=corp, dc=example, dc=com.

          UserBase -> (string)
              Select a particular subtree of the  directory  information  tree
              (DIT)  to search for user entries. The subtree is specified by a
              DN, which specifies the base node of the subtree.  For  example,
              by setting this option to ou=Users,ou=corp, dc=corp, dc=example,
              dc=com, the search for user entries is restricted to the subtree
              beneath ou=Users, ou=corp, dc=corp, dc=example, dc=com.

          UserRoleName -> (string)
              Specifies the name of the LDAP attribute for the user group mem-

          UserSearchMatching -> (string)
              The LDAP search filter used to find users within  the  userBase.
              The client's username is substituted into the {0} placeholder in
              the search filter.  For  example,  if  this  option  is  set  to
              (uid={0})  and the received username is janedoe, the search fil-
              ter becomes (uid=janedoe) after string substitution. It will re-
              sult  in  matching  an entry like uid=janedoe, ou=Users,ou=corp,
              dc=corp, dc=example, dc=com.

          UserSearchSubtree -> (boolean)
              The directory search scope for the user. If set to  true,  scope
              is to search the entire subtree.

          Hosts=string,string,RoleBase=string,RoleName=string,RoleSearchMatching=string,RoleSearchSubtree=boolean,ServiceAccountPassword=string,ServiceAccountUsername=string,UserBase=string,UserRoleName=string,UserSearchMatching=string,UserSearchSubtree=boolean
