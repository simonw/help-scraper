              Information about the states of the detector.

              (structure)
                 Information that defines a state of a detector.

                 stateName -> (string)
                     The name of the state.

                 onInput -> (structure)
                     When an input is received and the condition is TRUE, per-
                     form the specified actions .

                     events -> (list)
                        Specifies  the  actions  performed  when the condition
                        evaluates to TRUE.

                        (structure)
                            Specifies the actions to  be  performed  when  the

                                            range  key,  the  range  key  must
                                            match the item's sort key.

                                          If you don't specify this parameter,
                                          AWS IoT Events triggers the 'INSERT'

                                      payloadField -> (string)
                                          The name of the DynamoDB column that
                                          receives the action payload.

                                          If you don't specify this parameter,
                                          the  name  of the DynamoDB column is
                                          payload .

                                      tableName -> (string)
                                          The name of the DynamoDB table.  The
                                          tableName value must match the table
                                          name of the target DynamoDB table.

                                      payload -> (structure)
                                          Information needed to configure  the
                                          payload.

                                          By default, AWS IoT Events generates
                                          a standard payload in JSON  for  any
                                          action. This action payload contains
                                          all attribute-value pairs that  have
                                          the  information  about the detector
                                          model instance and the  event  trig-
                                          gered  the  action. To configure the
                                          action payload, you can use content-
                                          Expression .

                                          contentExpression -> (string)
                                             The  content  of the payload. You
                                             can use a string expression  that
                                             includes      quoted      strings
                                             ('<string>' ), variables  ($vari-

                                             put-name>.<path-to-datum>      ),
                                             string concatenations, and quoted
                                             strings  that  contain ${} as the
                                             content. The recommended  maximum
                                             size of a content expression is 1

                                          type -> (string)
                                             The value of the payload type can
                                             be either STRING or JSON .

                                   dynamoDBv2 -> (structure)
                                      Writes  to  the  DynamoDB table that you
                                      created. The default action payload con-
                                      tains  all  attribute-value  pairs  that
                                      have the information about the  detector
                                      model  instance and the event that trig-
                                      gered the action. You can customize  the
                                      payload  .  A separate column of the Dy-
                                      namoDB   table   receives   one   attri-
                                      bute-value  pair in the payload that you
                                      specify.  For  more   information,   see

                                          all attribute-value pairs that  have
                                          the  information  about the detector
                                          model instance and the  event  trig-
                                          gered  the  action. To configure the
                                          action payload, you can use content-
                                          Expression .

                                          contentExpression -> (string)

                                      tains  all  attribute-value  pairs  that
                                      have the information about the  detector
                                      model  instance and the event that trig-
                                      gered the action. You can customize  the
                                      payload  .  A separate column of the Dy-
                                      namoDB   table   receives   one   attri-

                                            as  a partition key. If you speci-
                                            fied a range key,  the  item  uses
                                            the range key as a sort key.

                                          o 'UPDATE' - Update an existing item

                                            must match the specified hash key.
                                            If  you specified a range key, the
                                            range key must  match  the  item's
                                            sort key.

                                          If you don't specify this parameter,
                                          the name of the DynamoDB  column  is
                                          payload .

                                      tableName -> (string)
                                          The  name of the DynamoDB table. The
                                          tableName value must match the table
                                          name of the target DynamoDB table.

                                      payload -> (structure)
                                          Information  needed to configure the
                                          payload.

                                          By default, AWS IoT Events generates
                                          a  standard  payload in JSON for any
                                          action. This action payload contains
                                          all  attribute-value pairs that have
                                          the information about  the  detector
                                          model  instance  and the event trig-
                                          gered the action. To  configure  the
                                          action payload, you can use content-
                                          Expression .

                                          contentExpression -> (string)
                                             The content of the  payload.  You
                                             can  use a string expression that
                                             includes      quoted      strings
                                             ('<string>'  ), variables ($vari-
                                             able.<variable-name>   ),   input

                                      Writes to the DynamoDB  table  that  you
                                      created. The default action payload con-
                                      tains  all  attribute-value  pairs  that
                                      have  the information about the detector
                                      model instance and the event that  trig-
                                      gered  the action. You can customize the
                                      payload . A separate column of  the  Dy-
                                      namoDB   table   receives   one   attri-

                                          By default, AWS IoT Events generates
                                          a  standard  payload in JSON for any
                                          action. This action payload contains
                                          all  attribute-value pairs that have
                                          the information about  the  detector
                                          model  instance  and the event trig-
                                          gered the action. To  configure  the
                                          action payload, you can use content-
                                          Expression .

                                            as a partition key. If you  speci-
                                            fied  a  range  key, the item uses
                                            the range key as a sort key.

                                          o 'UPDATE' - Update an existing item

                                          If you don't specify this parameter,
                                          the  name  of the DynamoDB column is
                                          payload .

                                      tableName -> (string)
                                          The name of the DynamoDB table.  The
                                          tableName value must match the table
                                          name of the target DynamoDB table.

                                      payload -> (structure)
                                          Information needed to configure  the
                                          payload.

                                          By default, AWS IoT Events generates
                                          a standard payload in JSON  for  any
                                          action. This action payload contains
                                          all attribute-value pairs that  have
                                          the  information  about the detector
                                          model instance and the  event  trig-
                                          gered  the  action. To configure the
                                          action payload, you can use content-
                                          Expression .

                                             The  content  of the payload. You
                                             can use a string expression  that
                                             includes      quoted      strings
                                             ('<string>' ), variables  ($vari-
                                             able.<variable-name>   ),   input
                                             values               ($input.<in-
                                             put-name>.<path-to-datum>      ),
                                             string concatenations, and quoted
                                             strings  that  contain ${} as the
                                             content. The recommended  maximum
                                             size of a content expression is 1
                                             KB.

                                          type -> (string)
                                             The value of the payload type can
                                             be either STRING or JSON .

                                   dynamoDBv2 -> (structure)
                                      Writes  to  the  DynamoDB table that you

                                      payload  .  A separate column of the Dy-
                                      namoDB   table   receives   one   attri-
                                      bute-value  pair in the payload that you
                                      specify.  For  more   information,   see
                                      Actions  in  AWS  IoT  Events  Developer

                                      tableName -> (string)
                                          The name of the DynamoDB table.

                                      payload -> (structure)
                                          Information needed to configure  the
                                          payload.

                                          By default, AWS IoT Events generates
                                          a standard payload in JSON  for  any
                                          action. This action payload contains
                                          all attribute-value pairs that  have
                                          the  information  about the detector
                                          model instance and the  event  trig-
                                          gered  the  action. To configure the
                                          action payload, you can use content-
                                          Expression .

                                          contentExpression -> (string)
                                             The  content  of the payload. You
                                             can use a string expression  that
                                             includes      quoted      strings
                                             ('<string>' ), variables  ($vari-
                                             able.<variable-name>   ),   input
                                             values               ($input.<in-
                                             put-name>.<path-to-datum>      ),
                                             string concatenations, and quoted
                                             strings  that  contain ${} as the
                                             content. The recommended  maximum
                                             size of a content expression is 1
                                             KB.

                                          type -> (string)
                                             The value of the payload type can
                                             be either STRING or JSON .

                                   iotSiteWise -> (structure)
                                      Sends  information  about  the  detector
                                      model instance and the event that  trig-
                                      gered the action to an asset property in
                                      AWS IoT SiteWise .

                                          You  can  use  the entry ID to track
                                          which data entry causes an error  in
                                          case  of  failure.  The default is a
                                          new unique identifier.

       --detector-model-description (string)
          A brief description of the detector model.

       --role-arn (string)
          The ARN of the role that grants permission to AWS IoT Events to per-
          form its operations.

       --evaluation-method (string)
          Information  about  the  order in which events are evaluated and how
          actions are executed.

          Possible values:

          o BATCH

          o SERIAL

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update a detector model

       The following update-detector-model example updates the  specified  de-
       tector model. Detectors (instances) spawned by the previous version are
       deleted and then re-created as new inputs arrive.

OUTPUT
       detectorModelConfiguration -> (structure)
          Information about how the detector model is configured.

          detectorModelName -> (string)
              The name of the detector model.

          detectorModelVersion -> (string)
              The version of the detector model.

          detectorModelDescription -> (string)
              A brief description of the detector model.

          detectorModelArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the detector model.

          roleArn -> (string)
              The  ARN of the role that grants permission to AWS IoT Events to
              perform its operations.

          creationTime -> (timestamp)
              The time the detector model was created.

          lastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
              The time the detector model was last updated.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the detector model.

          key -> (string)
              The value used to identify a detector instance. When a device or
              system  sends  input,  a new detector instance with a unique key
              value is created. AWS IoT Events can continue to route input  to
              its  corresponding  detector  instance based on this identifying
              information.

              This parameter uses a JSON-path expression to select the  attri-
              bute-value  pair in the message payload that is used for identi-
              fication. To route the message to the correct detector instance,
              the  device  must  send a message payload that contains the same
              attribute-value.

          evaluationMethod -> (string)
              Information about the order in which events  are  evaluated  and
              how actions are executed.
