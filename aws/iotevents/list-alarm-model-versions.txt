LIST-ALARM-MODEL-VERSIONS()                        LIST-ALARM-MODEL-VERSIONS()



NAME
       list-alarm-model-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  the  versions of an alarm model. The operation returns only
       the metadata associated with each alarm model version.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-alarm-model-versions
          --alarm-model-name <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --alarm-model-name (string)
          The name of the alarm model.

       --next-token (string)
          The token that you can use to return the next set of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to be returned per request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       alarmModelVersionSummaries -> (list)
          A list that summarizes each alarm model version.

          (structure)
              Contains a summary of an alarm model version.

              alarmModelName -> (string)
                 The name of the alarm model.

              alarmModelArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN of the alarm model. For more information, see Amazon
                 Resource Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference .

              alarmModelVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the alarm model.

              roleArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the IAM role that allows the alarm to perform  ac-
                 tions  and  access  AWS  resources. For more information, see
                 Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference .

              creationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time the alarm model was created, in the Unix epoch  for-
                 mat.

              lastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time the alarm model was last updated, in the Unix epoch
                 format.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the alarm model. The status can be one  of  the
                 following values:

                 o ACTIVE - The alarm model is active and it's ready to evalu-
                   ate data.

                 o ACTIVATING - AWS IoT Events is activating your alarm model.
                   Activating an alarm model can take up to a few minutes.

                 o INACTIVE  -  The alarm model is inactive, so it isn't ready
                   to evaluate data. Check your alarm  model  information  and
                   update the alarm model.

                 o FAILED  -  You  couldn't  create or update the alarm model.
                   Check your alarm model information and try again.

              statusMessage -> (string)
                 Contains information about the status of the alarm model ver-
                 sion.

       nextToken -> (string)
