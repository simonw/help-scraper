NAME
       get-detector-model-analysis-results -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves one or more analysis results of the detector model.

       NOTE:
          After  AWS IoT Events starts analyzing your detector model, you have
          up to 24 hours to retrieve the analysis results.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-detector-model-analysis-results
          --analysis-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --analysis-id (string)
          The ID of the analysis result that you want to retrieve.

       --next-token (string)
          The token that you can use to return the next set of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to be returned per request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       analysisResults -> (list)
          Contains information about one or more analysis results.

          (structure)
              Contains the result of the analysis.

              type -> (string)
                 The  type of the analysis result. Analyses fall into the fol-
                 lowing types based on the validators  used  to  generate  the
                 analysis result:

                 o supported-actions  -  You  must specify AWS IoT Events sup-
                   ported actions that work with other AWS services in a  sup-
                   ported AWS Region.

                 o service-limits  -  Resources or API operations can't exceed
                   service quotas (also known as limits). Update your detector
                   model or request a quota increase.

                 o structure - The detector model must follow a structure that
                   AWS IoT Events supports.

                 o expression-syntax - Your expression  must  follow  the  re-
                   quired syntax.

                 o data-type  -  Data  types  referenced in the detector model
                   must be compatible.

                 o referenced-data - You must define the  data  referenced  in
                   your detector model before you can use the data.

                 o referenced-resource  -  Resources  that  the detector model
                   uses must be available.

                 For more information, see Running detector model analyses  in
                 the AWS IoT Events Developer Guide .

              level -> (string)
                 The  severity  level  of  the  analysis  result. Based on the
                 severity level, analysis results fall into three general cat-
                 egories:

                 o INFO  - An information result tells you about a significant
                   field in your detector model. This type of  result  usually
                   doesn't require immediate action.

                 o WARNING  -  A  warning  result  draws  special attention to
                   fields that might cause issues for your detector model.  We
                   recommend  that  you review warnings and take necessary ac-
                   tions before you use your detector model in production  en-
                   vironments. Otherwise, the detector model might not work as
                   expected.

                 o ERROR - An error result notifies you about a problem  found
                   in  your detector model. You must fix all errors before you
                   can publish your detector model.

              message -> (string)
                 Contains additional information about the analysis result.

              locations -> (list)
                 Contains one or more locations that you can use to locate the
                 fields in your detector model that the analysis result refer-
                 ences.

                 (structure)
                     Contains information that you can use to locate the field
                     in  your  detector  model that the analysis result refer-
                     ences.

                     path -> (string)
                        A JsonPath expression that identifies the error  field
                        in your detector model.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  token  that  you  can use to return the next set of results, or
          null if there are no more results.
