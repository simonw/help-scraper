DESCRIBE-ALARM-MODEL()                                  DESCRIBE-ALARM-MODEL()



NAME
       describe-alarm-model -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about  an  alarm  model. If you don't specify a
       value for the alarmModelVersion parameter, the latest  version  is  re-
       turned.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-alarm-model
          --alarm-model-name <value>
          [--alarm-model-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --alarm-model-name (string)
          The name of the alarm model.

       --alarm-model-version (string)
          The version of the alarm model.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       creationTime -> (timestamp)
          The time the alarm model was created, in the Unix epoch format.

       alarmModelArn -> (string)
          The  ARN  of  the  alarm model. For more information, see Amazon Re-
          source Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference .

       alarmModelVersion -> (string)
          The version of the alarm model.

          The time the alarm model was last updated, in the Unix epoch format.

       status -> (string)
          The status of the alarm model. The status can be one of the  follow-
          ing values:

          o ACTIVE  -  The  alarm  model  is active and it's ready to evaluate
            data.

          o ACTIVATING - AWS IoT Events is activating your alarm model.  Acti-
            vating an alarm model can take up to a few minutes.

          o INACTIVE - The alarm model is inactive, so it isn't ready to eval-
            uate data. Check your alarm model information and update the alarm
            model.

          o FAILED - You couldn't create or update the alarm model. Check your
            alarm model information and try again.

                            tions,  and quoted strings that contain ${} as the
                            content. The recommended maximum size of a content
                            expression is 1 KB.

                        type -> (string)

                        dows newline), ',' (comma).

                     payload -> (structure)
                        You  can  configure the action payload when you send a
                        message to an Amazon Kinesis  Data  Firehose  delivery
                        stream.

                        contentExpression -> (string)
                            The  content  of the payload. You can use a string
                            expression   that    includes    quoted    strings
                            ('<string>'    ),    variables   ($variable.<vari-
                            able-name>   ),    input    values    ($input.<in-
                            put-name>.<path-to-datum>   ),  string  concatena-
                            tions, and quoted strings that contain ${} as  the
                            content. The recommended maximum size of a content
                            expression is 1 KB.

                        type -> (string)
                            The value of the payload type can be either STRING
                            or JSON .

                 dynamoDB -> (structure)
                     Defines  an  action to write to the Amazon DynamoDB table
                     that you created. The standard  action  payload  contains
                     all the information about the detector model instance and
                     the event that triggered the action.  You  can  customize
                     the  payload  . One column of the DynamoDB table receives
                     all attribute-value pairs in the payload that  you  spec-
                     ify.

                     You  must  use expressions for all parameters in DynamoD-
                     BAction . The  expressions  accept  literals,  operators,
                     functions, references, and substitution templates.
                        Examples

                     o For literal values, the expressions must contain single
                       quotes. For example, the value for the hashKeyType  pa-
                       rameter can be 'STRING' .

                     o For  references,  you  must specify either variables or
                       input values. For example, the value for  the  hashKey-
                       Field parameter can be $input.GreenhouseInput.name .

                     o For a substitution template, you must use ${} , and the
                       template must be in single quotes. A substitution  tem-
                       plate can also contain a combination of literals, oper-
                       ators, functions,  references,  and  substitution  tem-
                       plates.  In  the  following  example, the value for the
                       hashKeyValue parameter uses  a  substitution  template.
                       '${$input.GreenhouseInput.temperature  * 6 / 5 + 32} in
                       Fahrenheit'

                     o For a string concatenation, you must use + .  A  string
                       concatenation  can also contain a combination of liter-
                       als, operators, functions, references, and substitution
                       templates.  In the following example, the value for the
                       tableName  parameter  uses  a   string   concatenation.
                       'GreenhouseTemperatureTable  '  +  $input.GreenhouseIn-
                       put.date

                     Events Developer Guide .

                     If  the  defined payload type is a string, DynamoDBAction
                     writes non-JSON data to  the  DynamoDB  table  as  binary
                     data.   The   DynamoDB   console  displays  the  data  as
                     Base64-encoded text. The value for the  payloadField  pa-
                     rameter is <payload-field>_raw .

                     hashKeyType -> (string)
                        The data type for the hash key (also called the parti-
                        tion key). You can specify the following values:

                        o 'STRING' - The hash key is a string.

                        o 'NUMBER' - The hash key is a number.

                        If you don't specify hashKeyType , the  default  value
                        is 'STRING' .

                     hashKeyField -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the hash key (also called the partition
                        key). The hashKeyField value must match the  partition
                        key of the target DynamoDB table.

                     hashKeyValue -> (string)
                        The  value  of the hash key (also called the partition
                        key).

                     rangeKeyType -> (string)
                        The data type for the range key (also called the  sort
                        key), You can specify the following values:

                        o 'STRING' - The range key is a string.

                        o 'NUMBER' - The range key is number.

                        If you don't specify rangeKeyField , the default value
                        is 'STRING' .

                     rangeKeyField -> (string)
                        The name of the range key (also called the sort  key).
                        The rangeKeyField value must match the sort key of the
                        target DynamoDB table.

                     rangeKeyValue -> (string)
                        The value of the range key (also called the sort key).

                     operation -> (string)
                        The type of operation to perform. You can specify  the
                        following values:

                        o 'INSERT'  -  Insert  data as a new item into the Dy-
                          namoDB table. This item uses the specified hash  key
                          as  a  partition  key. If you specified a range key,
                          the item uses the range key as a sort key.

                        o 'UPDATE' - Update an existing item of  the  DynamoDB
                          table  with new data. This item's partition key must
                          match the specified hash key.  If  you  specified  a
                          range  key, the range key must match the item's sort
                          key.

                        o 'DELETE' - Delete an existing item of  the  DynamoDB
                          table.  This  item's  partition  key  must match the
                          specified hash key. If you specified  a  range  key,
                          the range key must match the item's sort key.

                        If  you  don't  specify this parameter, AWS IoT Events
                        triggers the 'INSERT' operation.

                     payloadField -> (string)
                        The name of the DynamoDB column that receives the  ac-
                        tion payload.

                        If  you  don't specify this parameter, the name of the
                        DynamoDB column is payload .

                     tableName -> (string)
                        The name of the DynamoDB table.  The  tableName  value
                        must  match  the table name of the target DynamoDB ta-
                        ble.

                     payload -> (structure)
                        Information needed to configure the payload.

                        By default, AWS IoT Events generates a  standard  pay-
                        load  in JSON for any action. This action payload con-
                        tains all attribute-value pairs that have the informa-
                        tion  about  the detector model instance and the event
                        triggered the action. To configure the action payload,
                        you can use contentExpression .

                        contentExpression -> (string)
                            The  content  of the payload. You can use a string
                            expression   that    includes    quoted    strings
                            ('<string>'    ),    variables   ($variable.<vari-
                            able-name>   ),    input    values    ($input.<in-
                            put-name>.<path-to-datum>   ),  string  concatena-
                            tions, and quoted strings that contain ${} as  the
                            content. The recommended maximum size of a content
                            expression is 1 KB.

                        type -> (string)
                            The value of the payload type can be either STRING
                            or JSON .

                 dynamoDBv2 -> (structure)
                     Defines  an  action to write to the Amazon DynamoDB table
                     that you created. The default action payload contains all
                     the information about the detector model instance and the
                     event that triggered the action. You  can  customize  the
                     payload  .  A  separate  column of the DynamoDB table re-
                     ceives one attribute-value pair in the payload  that  you
                     specify.

                     You  must  use  expressions  for  all  parameters  in Dy-
                     namoDBv2Action . The expressions accept literals,  opera-
                     tors, functions, references, and substitution templates.
                        Examples

                     o For literal values, the expressions must contain single
                       quotes. For example, the value for the tableName param-
                       eter can be 'GreenhouseTemperatureTable' .

                     o For  references,  you  must specify either variables or
                       input values. For example, the value for the  tableName
                       parameter can be $variable.ddbtableName .

                     o For a substitution template, you must use ${} , and the
                       template must be in single quotes. A substitution  tem-
                       plate can also contain a combination of literals, oper-
                       ators, functions,  references,  and  substitution  tem-
                       plates.  In  the  following  example, the value for the
                       contentExpression parameter in Payload uses a substitu-
                       tion template.   '{\"sensorID\": \"${$input.Greenhouse-
                       Input.sensor_id}\", \"temperature\":  \"${$input.Green-
                       houseInput.temperature * 9 / 5 + 32}\"}'

                     o For  a  string concatenation, you must use + . A string
                       concatenation can also contain a combination of  liter-
                       als, operators, functions, references, and substitution
                       templates. In the following example, the value for  the
                       tableName   parameter   uses  a  string  concatenation.
                       'GreenhouseTemperatureTable  '  +  $input.GreenhouseIn-
                       put.date

                     For  more  information,  see  Expressions  in the AWS IoT
                     Events Developer Guide .

                     The value for the type parameter in Payload must be  JSON
                     .

                     tableName -> (string)
                        The name of the DynamoDB table.

                     payload -> (structure)
                        Information needed to configure the payload.

                        By  default,  AWS IoT Events generates a standard pay-
                        load in JSON for any action. This action payload  con-
                        tains all attribute-value pairs that have the informa-
                        tion about the detector model instance and  the  event
                        triggered the action. To configure the action payload,
                        you can use contentExpression .

                        contentExpression -> (string)
                            The content of the payload. You can use  a  string
                            expression    that    includes    quoted   strings
                            ('<string>'   ),    variables    ($variable.<vari-
                            able-name>    ),    input    values   ($input.<in-
                            put-name>.<path-to-datum>  ),  string   concatena-
                            tions,  and quoted strings that contain ${} as the
                            content. The recommended maximum size of a content
                            expression is 1 KB.

                        type -> (string)
                            The value of the payload type can be either STRING
                            or JSON .

                 iotSiteWise -> (structure)
                     Sends information about the detector model  instance  and
                     the  event that triggered the action to a specified asset
                     property in AWS IoT SiteWise.

                     You must use expressions for all parameters  in  IotSite-
                     WiseAction  . The expressions accept literals, operators,
                     functions, references, and substitutions templates.
                        Examples

                     o For literal values, the expressions must contain single
                       quotes.  For  example,  the value for the propertyAlias
                       parameter can be '/company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temper-
                       ature' .

                     o For  references,  you  must specify either variables or
                       input values. For example, the value  for  the  assetId
                       parameter can be $input.TurbineInput.assetId1 .

                     o For a substitution template, you must use ${} , and the
                       template must be in single quotes. A substitution  tem-
                       plate can also contain a combination of literals, oper-
                       ators, functions,  references,  and  substitution  tem-
                       plates.  In  the  following  example, the value for the
                       propertyAlias parameter uses a  substitution  template.
                       'company/windfarm/${$input.TemperatureInput.sensor-
                       Data.windfarmID}/turbine/       ${$input.TemperatureIn-
                       put.sensorData.turbineID}/temperature'

                     You must specify either propertyAlias or both assetId and
                     propertyId to identify the target asset property  in  AWS
                     IoT SiteWise.

                               that must be 'TRUE' or 'FALSE' . You  must  use
                               an  expression, and the evaluated result should
                               be a Boolean value.
