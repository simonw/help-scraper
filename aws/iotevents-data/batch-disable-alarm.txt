SYNOPSIS
            batch-disable-alarm
          --disable-action-requests <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --disable-action-requests (list)
          The list of disable action requests. You can specify up  to  10  re-
          quests per operation.

          (structure)
              Information used to disable the alarm.

              requestId -> (string)
                 The request ID. Each ID must be unique within each batch.

              alarmModelName -> (string)
                 The name of the alarm model.

              keyValue -> (string)
                 The  value  of  the  key  used as a filter to select only the
                 alarms associated with the key .

              note -> (string)
                 The note that you can leave when you disable the alarm.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          requestId=string,alarmModelName=string,keyValue=string,note=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "requestId": "string",
              "alarmModelName": "string",
              "keyValue": "string",
              "note": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       errorEntries -> (list)
          A  list  of errors associated with the request, or null if there are
