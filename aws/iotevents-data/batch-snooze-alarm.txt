SYNOPSIS
            batch-snooze-alarm
          --snooze-action-requests <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --snooze-action-requests (list)
          The list of snooze action requests. You can specify  up  to  10  re-
          quests per operation.

          (structure)
              Information needed to snooze the alarm.

              requestId -> (string)
                 The request ID. Each ID must be unique within each batch.

              alarmModelName -> (string)
                 The name of the alarm model.

              keyValue -> (string)
                 The  value  of  the  key  used as a filter to select only the
                 alarms associated with the key .

              note -> (string)
                 The note that you can leave when you snooze the alarm.

              snoozeDuration -> (integer)
                 The snooze time in seconds. The alarm  automatically  changes
                 to the NORMAL state after this duration.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          requestId=string,alarmModelName=string,keyValue=string,note=string,snoozeDuration=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "requestId": "string",
              "alarmModelName": "string",
              "keyValue": "string",
              "note": "string",
              "snoozeDuration": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       errorEntries -> (list)
          A list of errors associated with the request, or null if  there  are
          no  errors.  Each  error  entry  contains an entry ID that helps you
          identify the entry that failed.

          (structure)
              Contains error messages associated with one of the following re-
              quests:

              o BatchEnableAlarm
