START-QUERY-EXECUTION()                                START-QUERY-EXECUTION()



NAME
       start-query-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Runs  the SQL query statements contained in the Query . Requires you to
       have access to the workgroup in which the query  ran.  Running  queries
       against  an external catalog requires  GetDataCatalog permission to the
       catalog. For code samples using the Amazon Web Services SDK  for  Java,
       see Examples and Code Samples in the Amazon Athena User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --query-string (string)
          The SQL query statements to be executed.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A  unique case-sensitive string used to ensure the request to create
          the query is idempotent (executes  only  once).  If  another  Start-
          QueryExecution  request  is  received, the same response is returned
          and another query is not created. An error is returned if a  parame-
          ter,  such  as QueryString , has changed. A call to StartQueryExecu-
          tion that uses a previous client  request  token  returns  the  same
          QueryExecutionId  even  if  the requester doesn't have permission on
          the tables specified in QueryString .

          WARNING:
              This token is listed as not required because Amazon Web Services
              SDKs  (for  example  the  Amazon  Web  Services  SDK  for  Java)
              auto-generate the token for users. If you are not using the Ama-
              zon  Web  Services  SDK or the Amazon Web Services CLI, you must
              provide this token or the action will fail.

       --query-execution-context (structure)
          The database within which the query executes.

          Database -> (string)
              The name of the database used in the query execution. The  data-
              base must exist in the catalog.

          Catalog -> (string)
              The name of the data catalog used in the query execution.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Database=string,Catalog=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Database": "string",
            "Catalog": "string"
          }

       --result-configuration (structure)
          Specifies information about where and how to save the results of the
          query execution. If the query runs in a workgroup, then  workgroup's
          settings may override query settings. This affects the query results
          location. The workgroup settings override is specified  in  Enforce-
          WorkGroupConfiguration  (true/false)  in the WorkGroupConfiguration.
          See  WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration .

          OutputLocation -> (string)
              The location in Amazon S3 where your query and  calculation  re-
              sults  are  stored,  such as s3://path/to/query/bucket/ . To run
              the query, you must specify the query results location using one
              of  the  ways:  either  for individual queries using either this
              setting (client-side), or in the workgroup, using  WorkGroupCon-
              figuration . If none of them is set, Athena issues an error that
              no output location is provided. If workgroup  settings  override
              client-side settings, then the query uses the settings specified
              for the workgroup. See  WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroup-
              Configuration .

          EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
              If query and calculation results are encrypted in Amazon S3, in-
              dicates the encryption option  used  (for  example,  SSE_KMS  or
              CSE_KMS ) and key information. This is a client-side setting. If
              workgroup settings override client-side settings, then the query
              uses  the  encryption  configuration  that  is specified for the
              workgroup, and also uses the location for storing query  results
              specified in the workgroup. See  WorkGroupConfiguration$Enforce-
              WorkGroupConfiguration   and   Workgroup    Settings    Override
              Client-Side Settings .

              EncryptionOption -> (string)
                 Indicates  whether Amazon S3 server-side encryption with Ama-
                 zon S3-managed keys (SSE_S3 ),  server-side  encryption  with
                 KMS-managed  keys  (SSE_KMS ), or client-side encryption with
                 KMS-managed keys (CSE_KMS ) is used.

                 If a query runs in a workgroup and  the  workgroup  overrides
                 client-side  settings,  then  the workgroup's setting for en-
                 cryption is used. It specifies whether query results must  be
                 encrypted, for all queries that run in this workgroup.

              KmsKey -> (string)
                 For SSE_KMS and CSE_KMS , this is the KMS key ARN or ID.

          ExpectedBucketOwner -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Web  Services  account ID that you expect to be the
              owner of the Amazon S3  bucket  specified  by   ResultConfigura-
              tion$OutputLocation  . If set, Athena uses the value for Expect-
              edBucketOwner when it makes Amazon S3 calls  to  your  specified
              output  location. If the ExpectedBucketOwner Amazon Web Services
              account ID does not match the actual  owner  of  the  Amazon  S3
              bucket, the call fails with a permissions error.

              This  is  a  client-side setting. If workgroup settings override
              client-side settings, then the  query  uses  the  ExpectedBucke-
              tOwner  setting  that  is  specified for the workgroup, and also
              uses the location for storing query  results  specified  in  the
              workgroup.  See  WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfigu-
              ration and Workgroup Settings Override Client-Side Settings .

          AclConfiguration -> (structure)
              Indicates that an Amazon S3 canned ACL should be set to  control
              ownership  of stored query results. Currently the only supported
              canned ACL is BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL . This is a  client-side
              setting.  If  workgroup  settings override client-side settings,
              then the query uses the ACL configuration that is specified  for
              the  workgroup, and also uses the location for storing query re-
              sults specified in the  workgroup.  For  more  information,  see
              WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration         and
              Workgroup Settings Override Client-Side Settings .

              S3AclOption -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 canned ACL  that  Athena  should  specify  when
                 storing  query  results.  Currently the only supported canned
                 ACL is BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL . If a query runs in a work-
                 group  and the workgroup overrides client-side settings, then
                 the Amazon S3 canned ACL specified in  the  workgroup's  set-
                 tings  is used for all queries that run in the workgroup. For
                 more information about Amazon S3 canned ACLs, see Canned  ACL
                 in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --work-group (string)
          The name of the workgroup in which the query is being started.

       --execution-parameters (list)
          A  list  of values for the parameters in a query. The values are ap-
          plied sequentially to the parameters in the query in  the  order  in
          which the parameters occur.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --result-reuse-configuration (structure)
          Specifies the query result reuse behavior for the query.

          ResultReuseByAgeConfiguration -> (structure)
              Specifies  whether previous query results are reused, and if so,
              their maximum age.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 True if previous query results can be reused when  the  query
                 is run; otherwise, false. The default is false.

              MaxAgeInMinutes -> (integer)
                 Specifies,  in  minutes,  the maximum age of a previous query
                 result that Athena should consider for reuse. The default  is
                 60.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResultReuseByAgeConfiguration={Enabled=boolean,MaxAgeInMinutes=integer}

       JSON Syntax:

              "Enabled": true|false,
              "MaxAgeInMinutes": integer
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example  1: To run a query in a workgroup on the specified table in the
       specified database and data catalog

       The following start-query-execution example uses the AthenaAdmin  work-
       group to run a query on the cloudfront_logs table in the cflogsdatabase
       in the AwsDataCatalog data catalog.

          aws athena start-query-execution \
              --query-string "select date, location, browser, uri, status from cloudfront_logs where method = 'GET' and status = 200 and location like 'SFO%' limit 10" \
              --work-group "AthenaAdmin" \
              --query-execution-context Database=cflogsdatabase,Catalog=AwsDataCatalog

       Output:

          {
          "QueryExecutionId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
          }

       For more information, see Running SQL Queries Using  Amazon  Athena  in
       the Amazon Athena User Guide.

       Example  2:  To run a query that uses a specified workgroup to create a
       database in the specified data catalog

       The following start-query-execution example uses the AthenaAdmin  work-
       group to create the database newdb in the default data catalog AwsData-
       Catalog.

          aws athena start-query-execution \
              --query-string "create database if not exists newdb" \
              --work-group "AthenaAdmin"

       Output:

          {
          "QueryExecutionId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11112"
          }

       For more information, see Running SQL Queries Using  Amazon  Athena  in
       the Amazon Athena User Guide.

       Example  3: To run a query that creates a view on a table in the speci-
       fied database and data catalog

       The following start-query-execution example uses  a SELECT statement on
       the  cloudfront_logs  table  in  the  cflogsdatabase to create the view
       cf10.

          aws athena start-query-execution \
              --query-string  "CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW cf10 AS SELECT * FROM cloudfront_logs limit 10" \
              --query-execution-context Database=cflogsdatabase

       Output:

          {
          "QueryExecutionId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11113"
          }
