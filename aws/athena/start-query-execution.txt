START-QUERY-EXECUTION()                                START-QUERY-EXECUTION()



NAME
       start-query-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Runs  the SQL query statements contained in the Query . Requires you to
       have access to the workgroup in which the query  ran.  Running  queries
       against  an external catalog requires  GetDataCatalog permission to the
       catalog. For code samples using the Amazon Web Services SDK  for  Java,
       see Examples and Code Samples in the Amazon Athena User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-query-execution
          --query-string <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--query-execution-context <value>]
          [--result-configuration <value>]
          [--work-group <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --query-string (string)
          The SQL query statements to be executed.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A  unique case-sensitive string used to ensure the request to create
          the query is idempotent (executes  only  once).  If  another  Start-
          QueryExecution  request  is  received, the same response is returned
          and another query is not created. If a parameter  has  changed,  for
          example, the QueryString , an error is returned.

          WARNING:
              This token is listed as not required because Amazon Web Services
              SDKs  (for  example  the  Amazon  Web  Services  SDK  for  Java)
              auto-generate the token for users. If you are not using the Ama-
              zon Web Services SDK or the Amazon Web Services  CLI,  you  must
              provide this token or the action will fail.

       --query-execution-context (structure)
          The database within which the query executes.

          Database -> (string)
              The  name of the database used in the query execution. The data-
              base must exist in the catalog.

          Catalog -> (string)
              The name of the data catalog used in the query execution.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Database=string,Catalog=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Database": "string",
            "Catalog": "string"
          }

       --result-configuration (structure)
          Specifies information about where and how to save the results of the
          query  execution. If the query runs in a workgroup, then workgroup's
          settings may override query settings. This affects the query results
          location.  The  workgroup settings override is specified in Enforce-
          WorkGroupConfiguration (true/false) in  the  WorkGroupConfiguration.
          See  WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration .

          OutputLocation -> (string)
              The  location  in Amazon S3 where your query results are stored,
              such as s3://path/to/query/bucket/ . To run the query, you  must
              specify the query results location using one of the ways: either
              for individual queries using either this setting  (client-side),
              or  in the workgroup, using  WorkGroupConfiguration . If none of
              them is set, Athena issues an error that no output  location  is
              provided. For more information, see Query Results . If workgroup
              settings override client-side settings, then the query uses  the
              settings  specified  for the workgroup. See  WorkGroupConfigura-
              tion$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration .

          EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
              If query results are encrypted in Amazon S3, indicates  the  en-
              cryption  option used (for example, SSE-KMS or CSE-KMS ) and key
              information. This is a client-side setting.  If  workgroup  set-
              tings override client-side settings, then the query uses the en-
              cryption configuration that is specified for the workgroup,  and
              also  uses  the  location for storing query results specified in
              the workgroup. See   WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupCon-
              figuration  and Workgroup Settings Override Client-Side Settings
              .

              EncryptionOption -> (string)
                 Indicates whether Amazon S3 server-side encryption with  Ama-
                 zon  S3-managed  keys  (SSE-S3 ), server-side encryption with
                 KMS-managed keys (SSE-KMS ), or client-side  encryption  with
                 KMS-managed keys (CSE-KMS) is used.

                 If  a  query  runs in a workgroup and the workgroup overrides
                 client-side settings, then the workgroup's  setting  for  en-
                 cryption  is used. It specifies whether query results must be
                 encrypted, for all queries that run in this workgroup.

              KmsKey -> (string)
                 For SSE-KMS and CSE-KMS , this is the KMS key ARN or ID.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          OutputLocation=string,EncryptionConfiguration={EncryptionOption=string,KmsKey=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "OutputLocation": "string",
            "EncryptionConfiguration": {
              "EncryptionOption": "SSE_S3"|"SSE_KMS"|"CSE_KMS",
              "KmsKey": "string"
            }
          }

       --work-group (string)
          The name of the workgroup in which the query is being started.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example  1: To run a query in a workgroup on the specified table in the
       specified database and data catalog

       The following start-query-execution example uses the AthenaAdmin  work-
       group to run a query on the cloudfront_logs table in the cflogsdatabase
       in the AwsDataCatalog data catalog.

          aws athena start-query-execution \
              --query-string "select date, location, browser, uri, status from cloudfront_logs where method = 'GET' and status = 200 and location like 'SFO%' limit 10" \
              --work-group "AthenaAdmin" \
              --query-execution-context Database=cflogsdatabase,Catalog=AwsDataCatalog

       Output:

          {
          "QueryExecutionId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
          }

       the Amazon Athena User Guide.

       Example  2:  To run a query that uses a specified workgroup to create a
       database in the specified data catalog

       The following start-query-execution example uses the AthenaAdmin  work-
       group to create the database newdb in the default data catalog AwsData-
       Catalog.

          aws athena start-query-execution \
              --query-string "create database if not exists newdb" \
              --work-group "AthenaAdmin"

       Output:

          {
          "QueryExecutionId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11112"
          }

       the Amazon Athena User Guide.

       Example  3: To run a query that creates a view on a table in the speci-
       fied database and data catalog

       The following start-query-execution example uses  a SELECT statement on
       the  cloudfront_logs  table  in  the  cflogsdatabase to create the view
       cf10.

          aws athena start-query-execution \
              --query-string  "CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW cf10 AS SELECT * FROM cloudfront_logs limit 10" \
              --query-execution-context Database=cflogsdatabase

       Output:

          {
          "QueryExecutionId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11113"
          }

       the Amazon Athena User Guide.

OUTPUT
       QueryExecutionId -> (string)
          The unique ID of the query that ran as a result of this request.
