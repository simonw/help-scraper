TAG-RESOURCE()                                                  TAG-RESOURCE()



NAME
       tag-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  one or more tags to an Athena resource. A tag is a label that you
       assign to a resource. In Athena, a resource can be a workgroup or  data
       catalog.  Each  tag  consists  of  a key and an optional value, both of
       which you define. For example, you can use tags  to  categorize  Athena
       workgroups  or  data  catalogs by purpose, owner, or environment. Use a
       consistent set of tag keys to make it easier to search and filter work-
       groups  or  data  catalogs  in  your  account.  For best practices, see
       Tagging Best Practices . Tag keys can be from 1 to  128  UTF-8  Unicode
       characters,  and  tag values can be from 0 to 256 UTF-8 Unicode charac-
       ters. Tags can use letters and numbers representable in UTF-8, and  the
       following  characters:  +  -  =  .  _  :  /  @. Tag keys and values are
       case-sensitive. Tag keys must be unique per resource.  If  you  specify
       more than one tag, separate them by commas.

SYNOPSIS
            tag-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          --tags <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          Specifies the ARN of the Athena resource (workgroup or data catalog)
          to which tags are to be added.

       --tags (list)
          A collection of one or more tags, separated by commas, to  be  added
          to an Athena workgroup or data catalog resource.

          (structure)
              A label that you assign to a resource. In Athena, a resource can
              be a workgroup or data catalog. Each tag consists of a  key  and
              an  optional  value,  both of which you define. For example, you
              can use tags to categorize Athena workgroups or data catalogs by
              purpose, owner, or environment. Use a consistent set of tag keys
              to make it easier to search and filter workgroups or data  cata-
              logs in your account. For best practices, see Tagging Best Prac-
              tices . Tag keys can be from 1 to 128 UTF-8 Unicode  characters,
              and  tag  values  can be from 0 to 256 UTF-8 Unicode characters.
              Tags can use letters and numbers representable in UTF-8, and the
              following  characters:  + - = . _ : / @. Tag keys and values are
              case-sensitive. Tag keys must be unique  per  resource.  If  you
              specify more than one tag, separate them by commas.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  tag key. The tag key length is from 1 to 128 Unicode char-
                 acters in UTF-8. You  can  use  letters  and  numbers  repre-
                 sentable  in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ :
                 / @. Tag keys are case-sensitive and must be unique  per  re-
                 source.

              Value -> (string)
                 A  tag  value.  The tag value length is from 0 to 256 Unicode
                 characters in UTF-8. You can use letters and  numbers  repre-
                 sentable  in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ :
                 / @. Tag values are case-sensitive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To add a tag to a resource

       The  following  tag-resource  example  adds  three  tags  to  the   dy-
       namo_db_catalog data catalog.

          aws athena tag-resource \
              --resource-arn arn:aws:athena:us-west-2:111122223333:datacatalog/dynamo_db_catalog \
              --tags Key=Organization,Value=Retail Key=Division,Value=Mountain Key=Product_Line,Value=Shoes Key=Location,Value=Denver

       This  command  produces  no  output. To see the  result, use aws athena
       list-tags-for-resource                                   --resource-arn
       arn:aws:athena:us-west-2:111122223333:datacatalog/dynamo_db_catalog.

       For  more  information,  see Adding tags to a resource: tag-resource in
       the Amazon Athena User Guide.
