NAME
       create-named-query -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  named  query  in the specified workgroup. Requires that you
       have access to the workgroup.

       For code samples using the  Amazon  Web  Services  SDK  for  Java,  see
       Examples and Code Samples in the Amazon Athena User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-named-query
          --name <value>
          [--description <value>]
          --database <value>
          --query-string <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--work-group <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The query name.

       --description (string)
          The query description.

       --database (string)
          The database to which the query belongs.

       --query-string (string)
          The contents of the query with all query statements.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A  unique case-sensitive string used to ensure the request to create
          the query is idempotent (executes only  once).  If  another  Create-
          NamedQuery  request  is  received, the same response is returned and
          another query is not created. If a parameter has changed, for  exam-
          ple, the QueryString , an error is returned.

          WARNING:
              This token is listed as not required because Amazon Web Services
              SDKs  (for  example  the  Amazon  Web  Services  SDK  for  Java)
              auto-generate the token for users. If you are not using the Ama-
              zon Web Services SDK or the Amazon Web Services  CLI,  you  must
              provide this token or the action will fail.

       --work-group (string)
          The name of the workgroup in which the named query is being created.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a named query

       The following create-named-query example creates a saved query  in  the
       AthenaAdmin  workgroup  that  queries  the  flights_parquet  table  for
       flights from Seattle to New York in January, 2016 whose  departure  and
       arrival were both delayed by more than ten minutes. Because the airport
       code values in the table are strings that include  double  quotes  (for
       example, "SEA"), they are escaped by backslashes and surrounded by sin-
       gle quotes.

          aws athena create-named-query \
              --name "SEA to JFK delayed flights Jan 2016" \
              --description "Both arrival and departure delayed more than 10 minutes." \
              --database sampledb \
              --query-string "SELECT flightdate, carrier, flightnum, origin, dest, depdelayminutes, arrdelayminutes FROM sampledb.flights_parquet WHERE yr = 2016 AND month = 1 AND origin = '\"SEA\"' AND dest = '\"JFK\"' AND depdelayminutes > 10 AND arrdelayminutes > 10" \
              --work-group AthenaAdmin

       Output:

          {
              "NamedQueryId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
          }

OUTPUT
       NamedQueryId -> (string)
          The unique ID of the query.
