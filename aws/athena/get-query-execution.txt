GET-QUERY-EXECUTION()                                    GET-QUERY-EXECUTION()



NAME
       get-query-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about a single execution of a query if you have ac-
       cess to the workgroup in which the query ran. Each time  a  query  exe-
       cutes, information about the query execution is saved with a unique ID.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-query-execution
          --query-execution-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --query-execution-id (string)
          The unique ID of the query execution.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

OUTPUT
       QueryExecution -> (structure)
          Information about the query execution.

          QueryExecutionId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for each query execution.

          Query -> (string)
              The SQL query statements which the query execution ran.

          StatementType -> (string)
              The type of query statement that  was  run.  DDL  indicates  DDL
              query statements. DML indicates DML (Data Manipulation Language)
              query statements, such as CREATE TABLE AS SELECT . UTILITY indi-
              cates query statements other than DDL and DML, such as SHOW CRE-
              ATE TABLE , or DESCRIBE TABLE .

          ResultConfiguration -> (structure)
              The location in Amazon S3 where query results  were  stored  and
              the encryption option, if any, used for query results. These are
              known as "client-side settings". If workgroup settings  override
              client-side  settings,  then the query uses the location for the
              query results and the encryption configuration that  are  speci-
              fied for the workgroup.

              OutputLocation -> (string)
                 The  location  in  Amazon  S3  where  your  query results are
                 stored, such  as  s3://path/to/query/bucket/  .  To  run  the
                 query,  you must specify the query results location using one
                 of the ways: either for individual queries using either  this
                 setting (client-side), or in the workgroup, using  WorkGroup-
                 Configuration . If none of them is set, Athena issues an  er-
                 ror  that  no  output location is provided. For more informa-
                 tion, see Query Results  .  If  workgroup  settings  override
                 client-side settings, then the query uses the settings speci-
                 fied for the workgroup. See   WorkGroupConfiguration$Enforce-
                 WorkGroupConfiguration .

              EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                 If  query  results  are encrypted in Amazon S3, indicates the
                 encryption option used (for example, SSE-KMS or CSE-KMS ) and
                 key  information. This is a client-side setting. If workgroup
                 settings override client-side settings, then the  query  uses
                 the  encryption configuration that is specified for the work-
                 group, and also uses the location for storing  query  results
                 specified  in  the workgroup. See  WorkGroupConfiguration$En-
                 forceWorkGroupConfiguration and Workgroup  Settings  Override
                 Client-Side Settings .

                 EncryptionOption -> (string)
                     Indicates  whether  Amazon S3 server-side encryption with
                     Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3 ), server-side  encryption
                     with  KMS-managed keys (SSE-KMS ), or client-side encryp-
                     tion with KMS-managed keys (CSE-KMS) is used.

                     If a query runs in a workgroup and  the  workgroup  over-
                     rides  client-side settings, then the workgroup's setting
                     for encryption is used. It specifies  whether  query  re-
                     sults must be encrypted, for all queries that run in this
                     workgroup.

                 KmsKey -> (string)
                     For SSE-KMS and CSE-KMS , this is the KMS key ARN or ID.

              ExpectedBucketOwner -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account ID that you expect to be  the
                 owner  of the Amazon S3 bucket specified by  ResultConfigura-
                 tion$OutputLocation . If set, Athena uses the value  for  Ex-
                 pectedBucketOwner when it makes Amazon S3 calls to your spec-
                 ified output location. If the ExpectedBucketOwner Amazon  Web
                 Services  account  ID  does not match the actual owner of the
                 Amazon S3 bucket, the call fails with a permissions error.

                 This is a client-side setting. If workgroup settings override
                 client-side  settings, then the query uses the ExpectedBucke-
                 tOwner setting that is specified for the workgroup, and  also
                 uses  the location for storing query results specified in the
                 workgroup.  See   WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupCon-
                 figuration  and  Workgroup Settings Override Client-Side Set-
                 tings .

          QueryExecutionContext -> (structure)
              The database in which the query execution occurred.

              Database -> (string)
                 The name of the database used in  the  query  execution.  The
                 database must exist in the catalog.

              Catalog -> (string)
                 The name of the data catalog used in the query execution.

          Status -> (structure)
              The  completion  date, current state, submission time, and state
              change reason (if applicable) for the query execution.

              State -> (string)
                 The state of query execution. QUEUED indicates that the query
                 has  been  submitted  to the service, and Athena will execute
                 the query as soon as resources are available.  RUNNING  indi-
                 cates  that  the query is in execution phase. SUCCEEDED indi-
                 cates that the query completed without errors.  FAILED  indi-
                 cates  that  the  query experienced an error and did not com-
                 plete processing. CANCELLED indicates that a user  input  in-
                 terrupted query execution.

                 NOTE:
                     Athena  automatically  retries  your  queries in cases of
                     certain transient errors. As a result, you  may  see  the
                     query state transition from RUNNING or FAILED to QUEUED .

              StateChangeReason -> (string)
                 Further detail about the status of the query.

              SubmissionDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the query was submitted.

              CompletionDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the query completed.

              AthenaError -> (structure)
                 Provides information about an Athena query error.

                 ErrorCategory -> (integer)
                     An  integer  value that specifies the category of a query
                     failure error. The following list shows the category  for
                     each integer value.
                        1 - System

                        2 - User

                        3 - Unknown

                 ErrorType -> (integer)
                     An integer value that provides specific information about
                     an Athena query error. For the meaning of  specific  val-
                     ues,  see  the  Error Type Reference in the Amazon Athena
                     User Guide .

          Statistics -> (structure)
              Query execution statistics, such as the amount of data  scanned,
              the  amount of time that the query took to process, and the type
              of statement that was run.

              EngineExecutionTimeInMillis -> (long)
                 The number of milliseconds that the query took to execute.

              DataScannedInBytes -> (long)
                 The number of bytes in the data that was queried.

              DataManifestLocation -> (string)
                 The location and file name of a data manifest file. The mani-
                 fest  file  is  saved to the Athena query results location in
                 Amazon S3. The manifest file  tracks  files  that  the  query
                 wrote  to  Amazon  S3.  If the query fails, the manifest file
                 also tracks files that the query intended to write. The mani-
                 fest  is useful for identifying orphaned files resulting from
                 a failed query. For more information, see Working with  Query
                 Results, Output Files, and Query History in the Amazon Athena
                 User Guide .

              TotalExecutionTimeInMillis -> (long)
                 The number of milliseconds that Athena took to run the query.

              QueryQueueTimeInMillis -> (long)
                 The number of milliseconds that the query was in  your  query
                 queue  waiting  for  resources. Note that if transient errors
                 occur, Athena might automatically add the query back  to  the
                 queue.

              QueryPlanningTimeInMillis -> (long)
                 The number of milliseconds that Athena took to plan the query
                 processing flow. This includes the time spent retrieving  ta-
                 ble  partitions  from  the data source. Note that because the
                 query engine performs the query planning, query planning time
                 is a subset of engine processing time.

              ServiceProcessingTimeInMillis -> (long)
                 The  number  of milliseconds that Athena took to finalize and
                 publish the query results after  the  query  engine  finished
                 running the query.

          WorkGroup -> (string)
              The name of the workgroup in which the query ran.

          EngineVersion -> (structure)
              The engine version that executed the query.

              SelectedEngineVersion -> (string)
                 The engine version requested by the user. Possible values are
                 determined by the output of  ListEngineVersions  ,  including
                 Auto. The default is Auto.

              EffectiveEngineVersion -> (string)
                 Read only. The engine version on which the query runs. If the
                 user requests a valid engine version other than Auto, the ef-
                 fective engine version is the same as the engine version that
                 the user requested. If the user requests Auto, the  effective
                 engine  version is chosen by Athena. When a request to update
                 the engine version is made by a  CreateWorkGroup  or  Update-
                 WorkGroup  operation, the EffectiveEngineVersion field is ig-
                 nored.
