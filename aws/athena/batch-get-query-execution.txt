BATCH-GET-QUERY-EXECUTION()                        BATCH-GET-QUERY-EXECUTION()



NAME
       batch-get-query-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  details of a single query execution or a list of up to 50
       query executions, which you provide as an array of query  execution  ID
       strings.  Requires  you  to  have  access to the workgroup in which the
       queries ran. To get a list of query execution IDs, use  ListQueryExecu-
       tionsInput$WorkGroup  .  Query  executions  differ  from  named (saved)
       queries.  Use   BatchGetNamedQueryInput  to  get  details  about  named
       queries.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-get-query-execution
          --query-execution-ids <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --query-execution-ids (list)
          An array of query execution IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To return information about one or more query executions

       The following batch-get-query-execution example returns query execution
       information for the queries that have the specified query IDs.

OUTPUT
       QueryExecutions -> (list)
          Information about a query execution.

          (structure)
              Information about a single instance of a query execution.

              QueryExecutionId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for each query execution.

              Query -> (string)
                 The SQL query statements which the query execution ran.

              StatementType -> (string)
                 The type of query statement that was run. DDL  indicates  DDL
                 query  statements.  DML indicates DML (Data Manipulation Lan-
                 guage) query statements, such as CREATE  TABLE  AS  SELECT  .
                 UTILITY  indicates  query  statements other than DDL and DML,
                 such as SHOW CREATE TABLE , or DESCRIBE TABLE .

              ResultConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The location in Amazon S3 where query results were stored and
                 the  encryption option, if any, used for query results. These
                 are known as "client-side settings".  If  workgroup  settings
                 override  client-side settings, then the query uses the loca-
                 tion for the query results and the  encryption  configuration
                 that are specified for the workgroup.

                 OutputLocation -> (string)
                     The  location  in  Amazon S3 where your query results are
                     stored, such as s3://path/to/query/bucket/ . To  run  the
                     query,  you must specify the query results location using
                     one of the ways: either for individual queries using  ei-
                     ther this setting (client-side), or in the workgroup, us-
                     ing  WorkGroupConfiguration . If none  of  them  is  set,
                     Athena  issues  an  error that no output location is pro-
                     vided. For more information, see Query Results . If work-
                     group  settings  override  client-side settings, then the
                     query uses the settings specified for the workgroup.  See
                     WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration .

                 EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                     If  query  results  are encrypted in Amazon S3, indicates
                     the encryption  option  used  (for  example,  SSE-KMS  or
                     CSE-KMS ) and key information. This is a client-side set-
                     ting. If workgroup  settings  override  client-side  set-
                     tings,  then  the query uses the encryption configuration
                     that is specified for the workgroup, and  also  uses  the
                     location for storing query results specified in the work-
                     group.  See   WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupCon-
                     figuration  and  Workgroup  Settings Override Client-Side
                     Settings .

                     EncryptionOption -> (string)
                        Indicates whether  Amazon  S3  server-side  encryption
                        with Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3 ), server-side en-
                        cryption  with  KMS-managed  keys   (SSE-KMS   ),   or
                        client-side encryption with KMS-managed keys (CSE-KMS)
                        is used.

                        If a query runs in a workgroup and the workgroup over-
                        rides  client-side settings, then the workgroup's set-
                        ting for encryption  is  used.  It  specifies  whether
                        query  results must be encrypted, for all queries that
                        run in this workgroup.

                     KmsKey -> (string)
                        For SSE-KMS and CSE-KMS , this is the KMS key  ARN  or
                        ID.

              QueryExecutionContext -> (structure)
                 The database in which the query execution occurred.

                 Database -> (string)
                     The name of the database used in the query execution. The
                     database must exist in the catalog.

                 Catalog -> (string)
                     The name of the data catalog used in the query execution.

              Status -> (structure)
                 The completion date,  current  state,  submission  time,  and
                 state change reason (if applicable) for the query execution.

                 State -> (string)
                     The  state  of query execution. QUEUED indicates that the
                     query has been submitted to the service, and Athena  will
                     execute  the  query  as  soon as resources are available.
                     RUNNING indicates that the query is in  execution  phase.
                     SUCCEEDED  indicates that the query completed without er-
                     rors. FAILED indicates that the query experienced an  er-
                     ror  and did not complete processing. CANCELLED indicates
                     that a user input interrupted query execution.

                     NOTE:
                        Athena automatically retries your queries in cases  of
                        certain transient errors. As a result, you may see the
                        query state  transition  from  RUNNING  or  FAILED  to
                        QUEUED .

                 StateChangeReason -> (string)
                     Further detail about the status of the query.

                 SubmissionDateTime -> (timestamp)
                     The date and time that the query was submitted.

                 CompletionDateTime -> (timestamp)
                     The date and time that the query completed.

                 AthenaError -> (structure)
                     Provides information about an Athena query error.

                     ErrorCategory -> (integer)
                        An  integer  value  that  specifies  the category of a
                        query failure error. The following list shows the cat-
                        egory for each integer value.
                            1 - System

                            2 - User

                            3 - Unknown

              Statistics -> (structure)
                 Query  execution  statistics,  such  as  the  amount  of data
                 scanned, the amount of time that the query took  to  process,
                 and the type of statement that was run.

                 EngineExecutionTimeInMillis -> (long)
                     The  number  of  milliseconds that the query took to exe-
                     cute.

                 DataScannedInBytes -> (long)
                     The number of bytes in the data that was queried.

                 DataManifestLocation -> (string)
                     The location and file name of a data manifest  file.  The
                     manifest  file is saved to the Athena query results loca-
                     tion in Amazon S3. The manifest file  tracks  files  that
                     the  query  wrote  to  Amazon S3. If the query fails, the
                     manifest file also tracks files that the  query  intended
                     to write. The manifest is useful for identifying orphaned
                     files resulting from a failed query.  For  more  informa-
                     tion,  see  Working with Query Results, Output Files, and
                     Query History in the Amazon Athena User Guide .

                 TotalExecutionTimeInMillis -> (long)
                     The number of milliseconds that Athena took  to  run  the
                     query.

                 QueryQueueTimeInMillis -> (long)
                     The  number  of  milliseconds  that the query was in your
                     query queue waiting for resources. Note that if transient
                     errors  occur,  Athena  might automatically add the query
                     back to the queue.

                 QueryPlanningTimeInMillis -> (long)
                     The number of milliseconds that Athena took to  plan  the
                     query  processing  flow. This includes the time spent re-
                     trieving table partitions from the data source. Note that
                     because  the  query  engine  performs the query planning,
                     query planning time is  a  subset  of  engine  processing
                     time.

                 ServiceProcessingTimeInMillis -> (long)
                     The  number  of milliseconds that Athena took to finalize
                     and publish the query results after the query engine fin-
                     ished running the query.

              WorkGroup -> (string)
                 The name of the workgroup in which the query ran.

              EngineVersion -> (structure)
                 The engine version that executed the query.

                 SelectedEngineVersion -> (string)
                     The engine version requested by the user. Possible values
                     are determined by the output of ListEngineVersions ,  in-
                     cluding Auto. The default is Auto.

                 EffectiveEngineVersion -> (string)
                     Read only. The engine version on which the query runs. If
                     the user requests a valid engine version other than Auto,
                     the  effective  engine  version is the same as the engine
                     version that the user requested.  If  the  user  requests
                     Auto,  the  effective engine version is chosen by Athena.
                     When a request to update the engine version is made by  a
                     CreateWorkGroup  or UpdateWorkGroup operation, the Effec-
                     tiveEngineVersion field is ignored.

       UnprocessedQueryExecutionIds -> (list)
          Information about the query executions that failed to run.

          (structure)
              Describes a query execution that failed to process.

              QueryExecutionId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the query execution.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The error code returned when the query  execution  failed  to
                 process, if applicable.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 The error message returned when the query execution failed to
                 process, if applicable.
