LIST-ENGINE-VERSIONS()                                  LIST-ENGINE-VERSIONS()



NAME
       list-engine-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of engine versions that are available to choose from,
       including the Auto option.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-engine-versions
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          A token generated by the Athena service that specifies where to con-
          tinue  pagination if a previous request was truncated. To obtain the
          next set of pages, pass in the NextToken from the response object of
          the previous page call.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of engine versions to return in this request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EngineVersions -> (list)
          A list of engine versions that are available to choose from.

          (structure)
              The Athena engine version for running queries.

              SelectedEngineVersion -> (string)
                 The engine version requested by the user. Possible values are
                 determined  by  the  output of ListEngineVersions , including
                 Auto. The default is Auto.

              EffectiveEngineVersion -> (string)
                 Read only. The engine version on which the query runs. If the
                 user requests a valid engine version other than Auto, the ef-
                 fective engine version is the same as the engine version that
                 the  user requested. If the user requests Auto, the effective
                 engine version is chosen by Athena. When a request to  update
                 the  engine  version  is made by a CreateWorkGroup or Update-
                 WorkGroup operation, the EffectiveEngineVersion field is  ig-
                 nored.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token generated by the Athena service that specifies where to con-
          tinue pagination if a previous request was truncated. To obtain  the
          next set of pages, pass in the NextToken from the response object of
          the previous page call.
