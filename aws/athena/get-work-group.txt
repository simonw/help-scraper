GET-WORK-GROUP()                                              GET-WORK-GROUP()



NAME
       get-work-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about the workgroup with the specified name.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-work-group
          --work-group <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --work-group (string)
          The name of the workgroup.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To return  information about a workgroup

       The following get-work-group  example  returns  information  about  the
       AthenaAdmin workgroup.

          aws athena get-work-group \
              --work-group AthenaAdmin

OUTPUT
       WorkGroup -> (structure)
          Information about the workgroup.

          Name -> (string)
              The workgroup name.

          State -> (string)
              The state of the workgroup: ENABLED or DISABLED.

          Configuration -> (structure)
              The configuration of the workgroup, which includes the  location
              in Amazon S3 where query results are stored, the encryption con-
              figuration, if any, used for query results; whether  the  Amazon
              CloudWatch  Metrics are enabled for the workgroup; whether work-
              group settings override client-side settings; and the data usage
              limits  for  the  amount  of data scanned per query or per work-
              group. The workgroup settings override is specified in  Enforce-
              WorkGroupConfiguration  (true/false)  in the WorkGroupConfigura-
              tion . See  WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration
              .

              ResultConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The configuration for the workgroup, which includes the loca-
                 tion in Amazon S3 where query results are stored and the  en-
                 cryption  option,  if any, used for query results. To run the
                 query, you must specify the query results location using  one
                 of  the  ways: either in the workgroup using this setting, or
                 for individual queries (client-side), using  ResultConfigura-
                 tion$OutputLocation  .  If none of them is set, Athena issues
                 an error that no output location is provided. For more infor-
                 mation, see Query Results .

                 OutputLocation -> (string)
                     The  location  in  Amazon S3 where your query results are
                     stored, such as s3://path/to/query/bucket/ . To  run  the
                     query,  you must specify the query results location using
                     one of the ways: either for individual queries using  ei-
                     ther this setting (client-side), or in the workgroup, us-
                     ing  WorkGroupConfiguration . If none  of  them  is  set,
                     Athena  issues  an  error that no output location is pro-
                     vided. For more information, see Query Results . If work-
                     group  settings  override  client-side settings, then the
                     query uses the settings specified for the workgroup.  See
                     WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration .

                 EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                     If  query  results  are encrypted in Amazon S3, indicates
                     the encryption  option  used  (for  example,  SSE-KMS  or
                     CSE-KMS ) and key information. This is a client-side set-
                     ting. If workgroup  settings  override  client-side  set-
                     tings,  then  the query uses the encryption configuration
                     that is specified for the workgroup, and  also  uses  the
                     location for storing query results specified in the work-
                     group.  See   WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupCon-
                     figuration  and  Workgroup  Settings Override Client-Side
                     Settings .

                     EncryptionOption -> (string)
                        Indicates whether  Amazon  S3  server-side  encryption
                        with Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3 ), server-side en-
                        cryption  with  KMS-managed  keys   (SSE-KMS   ),   or
                        client-side encryption with KMS-managed keys (CSE-KMS)
                        is used.

                        If a query runs in a workgroup and the workgroup over-
                        rides  client-side settings, then the workgroup's set-
                        ting for encryption  is  used.  It  specifies  whether
                        query  results must be encrypted, for all queries that
                        run in this workgroup.

                     KmsKey -> (string)
                        For SSE-KMS and CSE-KMS , this is the KMS key  ARN  or
                        ID.

                 ExpectedBucketOwner -> (string)
                     The  Amazon Web Services account ID that you expect to be
                     the owner of the Amazon S3 bucket specified  by   Result-
                     Configuration$OutputLocation  .  If  set, Athena uses the
                     value for ExpectedBucketOwner when  it  makes  Amazon  S3
                     calls to your specified output location. If the Expected-
                     BucketOwner Amazon Web Services account ID does not match
                     the  actual owner of the Amazon S3 bucket, the call fails
                     with a permissions error.

                     This is a  client-side  setting.  If  workgroup  settings
                     override  client-side  settings,  then the query uses the
                     ExpectedBucketOwner setting that  is  specified  for  the
                     workgroup,  and  also uses the location for storing query
                     results specified in the workgroup. See  WorkGroupConfig-
                     uration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration  and Workgroup Set-
                     tings Override Client-Side Settings .

                 AclConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Indicates that an Amazon S3 canned ACL should be  set  to
                     control  ownership of stored query results. Currently the
                     only supported canned ACL is BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL  .
                     This  is  a  client-side  setting.  If workgroup settings
                     override client-side settings, then the  query  uses  the
                     ACL  configuration  that  is specified for the workgroup,
                     and also uses the  location  for  storing  query  results
                     specified  in  the  workgroup.  For more information, see
                     WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration  and
                     Workgroup Settings Override Client-Side Settings .

                     S3AclOption -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  S3  canned ACL that Athena should specify
                        when storing query results. Currently  the  only  sup-
                        ported  canned ACL is BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL . If a
                        query runs in a workgroup and the workgroup  overrides
                        client-side  settings,  then  the Amazon S3 canned ACL
                        specified in the workgroup's settings is used for  all
                        queries  that  run in the workgroup. For more informa-
                        tion about Amazon S3 canned ACLs, see  Canned  ACL  in
                        the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration -> (boolean)
                 If  set  to  "true",  the settings for the workgroup override
                 client-side settings. If set to "false", client-side settings
                 are  used. For more information, see Workgroup Settings Over-
                 ride Client-Side Settings .

              PublishCloudWatchMetricsEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates that the Amazon CloudWatch metrics are enabled  for
                 the workgroup.

              BytesScannedCutoffPerQuery -> (long)
                 The upper data usage limit (cutoff) for the amount of bytes a
                 single query in a workgroup is allowed to scan.

              RequesterPaysEnabled -> (boolean)
                 If set to true , allows members assigned to  a  workgroup  to
                 reference Amazon S3 Requester Pays buckets in queries. If set
                 to false , workgroup members cannot query data from Requester
                 Pays  buckets,  and queries that retrieve data from Requester
                 Pays buckets cause an error. The default is false . For  more
                 information  about Requester Pays buckets, see Requester Pays
                 Buckets in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer  Guide
                 .

              EngineVersion -> (structure)
                 The  engine version that all queries running on the workgroup
                 use. Queries on  the  AmazonAthenaPreviewFunctionality  work-
                 group run on the preview engine regardless of this setting.

                 SelectedEngineVersion -> (string)
                     The engine version requested by the user. Possible values
                     are determined by the output of ListEngineVersions ,  in-
                     cluding Auto. The default is Auto.

                 EffectiveEngineVersion -> (string)
                     Read only. The engine version on which the query runs. If
                     the user requests a valid engine version other than Auto,
                     the  effective  engine  version is the same as the engine
                     version that the user requested.  If  the  user  requests
                     Auto,  the  effective engine version is chosen by Athena.
                     When a request to update the engine version is made by  a
                     CreateWorkGroup  or UpdateWorkGroup operation, the Effec-
                     tiveEngineVersion field is ignored.

          Description -> (string)
              The workgroup description.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time the workgroup was created.



                                                              GET-WORK-GROUP()
