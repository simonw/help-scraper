LIST-TAGS-FOR-RESOURCE()                              LIST-TAGS-FOR-RESOURCE()



NAME
       list-tags-for-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the tags associated with an Athena workgroup or data catalog re-
       source.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-tags-for-resource is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Tags

SYNOPSIS
            list-tags-for-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          Lists the tags for the resource with the specified ARN.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To list the tags for a workgroup

       The following list-tags-for-resource example lists  the  tags  for  the
       Data_Analyst_Group workgroup.

          aws athena list-tags-for-resource \
              --resource-arn arn:aws:athena:us-west-2:111122223333:workgroup/Data_Analyst_Group

       Output:

          {
              "Tags": [
                  {
                      "Key": "Division",
                      "Value": "West"
                  },
                  {
                      "Key": "Team",
                      "Value": "Big Data"
                  },
                  {
                      "Key": "Location",
                      "Value": "Seattle"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Example 2: To list the tags for a data catalog

       The following list-tags-for-resource example lists the tags for the dy-
       namo_db_catalog data catalog.

          aws athena list-tags-for-resource \
              --resource-arn arn:aws:athena:us-west-2:111122223333:datacatalog/dynamo_db_catalog

       Output:

          {
              "Tags": [
                  {
                      "Key": "Division",
                      "Value": "Mountain"
                  },
                  {
                      "Key": "Organization",
                      "Value": "Retail"
                  },
                  {
                      "Key": "Product_Line",
                      "Value": "Shoes"
                  },
                  {
                      "Key": "Location",
                      "Value": "Denver"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Tags -> (list)
          The list of tags associated with the specified resource.

          (structure)
              A label that you assign to a resource. In Athena, a resource can
              be a workgroup or data catalog. Each tag consists of a  key  and
              an  optional  value,  both of which you define. For example, you
              can use tags to categorize Athena workgroups or data catalogs by
              purpose, owner, or environment. Use a consistent set of tag keys
              to make it easier to search and filter workgroups or data  cata-
              logs in your account. For best practices, see Tagging Best Prac-
              tices . Tag keys can be from 1 to 128 UTF-8 Unicode  characters,
              and  tag  values  can be from 0 to 256 UTF-8 Unicode characters.
              Tags can use letters and numbers representable in UTF-8, and the
              following  characters:  + - = . _ : / @. Tag keys and values are
              case-sensitive. Tag keys must be unique  per  resource.  If  you
              specify more than one tag, separate them by commas.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  tag key. The tag key length is from 1 to 128 Unicode char-
                 acters in UTF-8. You  can  use  letters  and  numbers  repre-
                 sentable  in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ :
                 / @. Tag keys are case-sensitive and must be unique  per  re-
                 source.

              Value -> (string)
                 A  tag  value.  The tag value length is from 0 to 256 Unicode
                 characters in UTF-8. You can use letters and  numbers  repre-
                 sentable  in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ :
                 / @. Tag values are case-sensitive.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token to be used by the next request if this request is truncated.
