LIST-WORK-GROUPS()                                          LIST-WORK-GROUPS()



NAME
       list-work-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists available workgroups for the account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-work-groups
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          A token generated by the Athena service that specifies where to con-
          tinue pagination if a previous request was truncated. To obtain  the
          next set of pages, pass in the NextToken from the response object of
          the previous page call.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of workgroups to return in this request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       WorkGroups -> (list)
          A list of  WorkGroupSummary objects that include the names, descrip-
          tions, creation times, and states for each workgroup.

          (structure)
              The summary information for the workgroup,  which  includes  its
              name, state, description, and the date and time it was created.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the workgroup.

              State -> (string)
                 The state of the workgroup.

              Description -> (string)
                 The workgroup description.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The workgroup creation date and time.

              EngineVersion -> (structure)
                 The  engine version setting for all queries on the workgroup.
                 Queries on the AmazonAthenaPreviewFunctionality workgroup run
                 on the preview engine regardless of this setting.

                 SelectedEngineVersion -> (string)
                     The engine version requested by the user. Possible values
                     are determined by the output of ListEngineVersions ,  in-
                     cluding Auto. The default is Auto.

                 EffectiveEngineVersion -> (string)
                     Read only. The engine version on which the query runs. If
                     the user requests a valid engine version other than Auto,
                     the  effective  engine  version is the same as the engine
                     version that the user requested.  If  the  user  requests
                     Auto,  the  effective engine version is chosen by Athena.
                     When a request to update the engine version is made by  a
                     CreateWorkGroup  or UpdateWorkGroup operation, the Effec-
                     tiveEngineVersion field is ignored.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token generated by the Athena service that specifies where to con-
          tinue  pagination if a previous request was truncated. To obtain the
          next set of pages, pass in the NextToken from the response object of
          the previous page call.
