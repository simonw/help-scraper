SYNOPSIS
            create-work-group
          --name <value>
          [--configuration <value>]
          [--description <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The workgroup name.

       --configuration (structure)
          The  configuration for the workgroup, which includes the location in
          Amazon S3 where query results are stored, the encryption  configura-
          tion,  if any, used for encrypting query results, whether the Amazon
          CloudWatch Metrics are enabled for the workgroup, the limit for  the
          amount  of bytes scanned (cutoff) per query, if it is specified, and
          whether workgroup's settings (specified with EnforceWorkGroupConfig-
          uration  )  in  the WorkGroupConfiguration override client-side set-
          tings. See  WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration .

          ResultConfiguration -> (structure)
              The configuration for the workgroup, which includes the location
              in  Amazon  S3 where query results are stored and the encryption
              option, if any, used for query results. To run  the  query,  you
              must  specify  the query results location using one of the ways:
              either in the workgroup using this setting,  or  for  individual
              queries (client-side), using  ResultConfiguration$OutputLocation
              . If none of them is set, Athena issues an error that no  output
              location is provided. For more information, see Query Results .

              OutputLocation -> (string)
                 The  location  in  Amazon  S3  where  your  query results are
                 stored, such  as  s3://path/to/query/bucket/  .  To  run  the
                 query,  you must specify the query results location using one
                 of the ways: either for individual queries using either  this
                 setting (client-side), or in the workgroup, using  WorkGroup-
                 Configuration . If none of them is set, Athena issues an  er-
                 ror  that  no  output location is provided. For more informa-
                 tion, see Query Results  .  If  workgroup  settings  override
                 client-side settings, then the query uses the settings speci-
                 fied for the workgroup. See   WorkGroupConfiguration$Enforce-
                 WorkGroupConfiguration .

              EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                 If  query  results  are encrypted in Amazon S3, indicates the
                 encryption option used (for example, SSE_KMS or CSE_KMS ) and
                 key  information. This is a client-side setting. If workgroup
                 settings override client-side settings, then the  query  uses
                 the  encryption configuration that is specified for the work-
                 group, and also uses the location for storing  query  results
                 specified  in  the workgroup. See  WorkGroupConfiguration$En-
                 forceWorkGroupConfiguration and Workgroup  Settings  Override
                 Client-Side Settings .

                 EncryptionOption -> (string)
                     Indicates  whether  Amazon S3 server-side encryption with
                     Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE_S3 ), server-side  encryption
                     with  KMS-managed keys (SSE_KMS ), or client-side encryp-
                     tion with KMS-managed keys (CSE_KMS ) is used.

                     If a query runs in a workgroup and  the  workgroup  over-
                     rides  client-side settings, then the workgroup's setting
                     for encryption is used. It specifies  whether  query  re-
                     sults must be encrypted, for all queries that run in this
                     workgroup.

                 KmsKey -> (string)
                     For SSE_KMS and CSE_KMS , this is the KMS key ARN or ID.

              ExpectedBucketOwner -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account ID that you expect to be  the
                 owner  of the Amazon S3 bucket specified by  ResultConfigura-
                 tion$OutputLocation . If set, Athena uses the value  for  Ex-
                 pectedBucketOwner when it makes Amazon S3 calls to your spec-
                 ified output location. If the ExpectedBucketOwner Amazon  Web
                 Services  account  ID  does not match the actual owner of the
                 Amazon S3 bucket, the call fails with a permissions error.

                 This is a client-side setting. If workgroup settings override
                 client-side  settings, then the query uses the ExpectedBucke-
                 tOwner setting that is specified for the workgroup, and  also
                 uses  the location for storing query results specified in the
                 workgroup.  See   WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupCon-
                 figuration  and  Workgroup Settings Override Client-Side Set-
                 tings .

              AclConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Indicates that an Amazon S3 canned ACL should be set to  con-
                 trol  ownership  of  stored query results. Currently the only
                 supported canned ACL is BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL . This is a
                 client-side   setting.   If   workgroup   settings   override
                 client-side settings, then the query uses the ACL  configura-
                 tion  that  is specified for the workgroup, and also uses the
                 location for storing query results  specified  in  the  work-
                 group.  For more information, see  WorkGroupConfiguration$En-
                 forceWorkGroupConfiguration and Workgroup  Settings  Override
                 Client-Side Settings .

                 S3AclOption -> (string)
                     The  Amazon S3 canned ACL that Athena should specify when
                     storing  query  results.  Currently  the  only  supported
                     canned ACL is BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL . If a query runs
                     in a workgroup and the  workgroup  overrides  client-side
                     settings,  then the Amazon S3 canned ACL specified in the
                     workgroup's settings is used for all queries that run  in
                     the  workgroup.  For  more  information  about  Amazon S3
                     canned ACLs, see Canned ACL in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration -> (boolean)
              If set to  "true",  the  settings  for  the  workgroup  override
              client-side  settings.  If  set to "false", client-side settings
              are used. For more information, see Workgroup Settings  Override
              Client-Side Settings .

          PublishCloudWatchMetricsEnabled -> (boolean)
              Indicates that the Amazon CloudWatch metrics are enabled for the
              workgroup.

          BytesScannedCutoffPerQuery -> (long)
              The upper data usage limit (cutoff) for the amount  of  bytes  a
              single query in a workgroup is allowed to scan.

          RequesterPaysEnabled -> (boolean)
              If  set to true , allows members assigned to a workgroup to ref-
              erence Amazon S3 Requester Pays buckets in queries.  If  set  to
              false  , workgroup members cannot query data from Requester Pays
              buckets, and queries that  retrieve  data  from  Requester  Pays
              buckets cause an error. The default is false . For more informa-
              tion about Requester Pays buckets, see Requester Pays Buckets in
              the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide .

          EngineVersion -> (structure)
              The  engine  version  that  all queries running on the workgroup
              use. Queries on the  AmazonAthenaPreviewFunctionality  workgroup
              run on the preview engine regardless of this setting.

              SelectedEngineVersion -> (string)
                 The engine version requested by the user. Possible values are
                 determined by the output of  ListEngineVersions  ,  including
                 Auto. The default is Auto.

              EffectiveEngineVersion -> (string)
                 Read only. The engine version on which the query runs. If the
                 user requests a valid engine version other than Auto, the ef-
                 fective engine version is the same as the engine version that
                 the user requested. If the user requests Auto, the  effective
                 engine  version is chosen by Athena. When a request to update
                 the engine version is made by a  CreateWorkGroup  or  Update-
                 WorkGroup  operation, the EffectiveEngineVersion field is ig-
                 nored.

       --description (string)
          The workgroup description.

       --tags (list)
          A list of comma separated tags to add to the workgroup that is  cre-
          ated.

          (structure)
              A label that you assign to a resource. In Athena, a resource can
              be a workgroup or data catalog. Each tag consists of a  key  and
              an  optional  value,  both of which you define. For example, you
              can use tags to categorize Athena workgroups or data catalogs by
              purpose, owner, or environment. Use a consistent set of tag keys
              to make it easier to search and filter workgroups or data  cata-
              logs in your account. For best practices, see Tagging Best Prac-
              tices . Tag keys can be from 1 to 128 UTF-8 Unicode  characters,
              and  tag  values  can be from 0 to 256 UTF-8 Unicode characters.
              Tags can use letters and numbers representable in UTF-8, and the
              following  characters:  + - = . _ : / @. Tag keys and values are
              case-sensitive. Tag keys must be unique  per  resource.  If  you
              specify more than one tag, separate them by commas.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  tag key. The tag key length is from 1 to 128 Unicode char-
                 acters in UTF-8. You  can  use  letters  and  numbers  repre-
                 sentable  in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ :
                 / @. Tag keys are case-sensitive and must be unique  per  re-
                 source.

              Value -> (string)
                 A  tag  value.  The tag value length is from 0 to 256 Unicode
                 characters in UTF-8. You can use letters and  numbers  repre-
                 sentable  in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ :
                 / @. Tag values are case-sensitive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a workgroup

       The following create-work-group  example  creates  a  workgroup  called
       Data_Analyst_Group that has the query results output location s3://aws-
       doc-example-bucket. The command  creates  a  workgroup  that  overrides
       client  configuration settings, which includes the query results output
       location. The command also  enables CloudWatch metrics and  adds  three
       key-value tag pairs to the workgroup to distinguish it from other work-
       groups. Note that the --configuration argument has no spaces before the
       commas that separate its options.

          aws athena create-work-group \
              --name Data_Analyst_Group \
              --configuration ResultConfiguration={OutputLocation="s3://awsdoc-example-bucket"},EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration="true",PublishCloudWatchMetricsEnabled="true" \
              --description "Workgroup for data analysts" \
              --tags Key=Division,Value=West Key=Location,Value=Seattle Key=Team,Value="Big Data"

       This  command  produces  no  output. To see the results, use aws athena
       get-work-group --work-group Data_Analyst_Group.
