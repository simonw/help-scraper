LIST-QUERY-EXECUTIONS()                                LIST-QUERY-EXECUTIONS()



NAME
       list-query-executions -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides a list of available query execution IDs for the queries in the
       specified workgroup. If a workgroup is not specified, returns a list of
       query execution IDs for the primary workgroup. Requires you to have ac-
       cess to the workgroup in which the queries ran.

       For code samples using the  Amazon  Web  Services  SDK  for  Java,  see
       Examples and Code Samples in the Amazon Athena User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-query-executions  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: QueryExecutionIds

SYNOPSIS
            list-query-executions
          [--work-group <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --work-group (string)
          The name of the workgroup from which queries are being returned.  If
          a  workgroup  is  not specified, a list of available query execution
          IDs for the queries in the primary workgroup is returned.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the query IDs of the queries in a specified workgroup

       The  following  list-query-executions example lists a maximum of ten of
       the query IDs in the AthenaAdmin workgroup.

          aws athena list-query-executions \
              --work-group AthenaAdmin \
              --max-items 10

       Output:

          {
              "QueryExecutionIds": [
                  "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11110",
                  "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",
                  "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE33333",
                  "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11114",
                  "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11115",
                  "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11116",
                  "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11117",
                  "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11118",
                  "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11119"
              ],
              "NextToken": "eyJOZXh0VG9rZW4iOiBudWxsLCAiYm90b190cnVuY2F0ZV9hbW91bnQiOiAxMH0="
          }
