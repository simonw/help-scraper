OPTIONS
       --create-delegation-requests (list)
          The API request to batch create delegations in Audit Manager.

          (structure)
              A  collection  of  attributes that's used to create a delegation
              for an assessment in Audit Manager.

              comment -> (string)
                 A comment that's related to the delegation request.

              controlSetId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the control set.

              roleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role.

              roleType -> (string)
                 The type of customer persona.

                 NOTE:
                     In CreateAssessment , roleType can only be  PROCESS_OWNER
                     .

                     In UpdateSettings , roleType can only be PROCESS_OWNER .

                     In  BatchCreateDelegationByAssessment , roleType can only
                     be RESOURCE_OWNER .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          comment=string,controlSetId=string,roleArn=string,roleType=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "comment": "string",
              "controlSetId": "string",
              "roleArn": "string",
              "roleType": "PROCESS_OWNER"|"RESOURCE_OWNER"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --assessment-id (string)
          The identifier for the assessment.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
