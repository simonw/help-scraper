       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-insights-by-assessment
          --assessment-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --assessment-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the assessment.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       insights -> (structure)
          The assessment analytics data that the  GetInsightsByAssessment  API
          returned.

          noncompliantEvidenceCount -> (integer)
              The number of compliance check evidence that Audit Manager clas-
              sified as non-compliant. This includes evidence  that  was  col-
              lected  from  Security Hub with a Fail ruling, or collected from
              Config with a Non-compliant ruling.

          compliantEvidenceCount -> (integer)
              The number of compliance check evidence that Audit Manager clas-
              sified  as  compliant. This includes evidence that was collected
              from Security Hub with a Pass ruling, or collected  from  Config
              with a Compliant ruling.

          inconclusiveEvidenceCount -> (integer)
              The  amount  of evidence without a compliance check ruling. Evi-
              dence is inconclusive if the associated  control  uses  Security
              Hub  or Config as a data source and you didn't enable those ser-
              vices. This is also the case if a control  uses  a  data  source
              that  doesnt support compliance checks (for example, manual evi-
              dence, API calls, or CloudTrail).

              NOTE:
                 If evidence has a compliance check status of not applicable ,
                 it's classified as inconclusive in InsightsByAssessment data.

          assessmentControlsCountByNoncompliantEvidence -> (integer)
              The  number  of assessment controls that collected non-compliant
              evidence on the lastUpdated date.

          totalAssessmentControlsCount -> (integer)
              The total number of controls in the assessment.

          lastUpdated -> (timestamp)
              The time when the assessment insights were last updated.
