LIST-CONTROL-DOMAIN-INSIGHTS-BY-ASLIST-CONTROL-DOMAIN-INSIGHTS-BY-ASSESSMENT()



NAME
       list-control-domain-insights-by-assessment -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  analytics data for control domains within a specified active as-
       sessment.

       NOTE:
          A control domain is listed only if at  least  one  of  the  controls
          within  that  domain  collected  evidence on the lastUpdated date of
          controlDomainInsights . If this  condition  isnt  met,  no  data  is
          listed for that domain.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-control-domain-insights-by-assessment
          --assessment-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --assessment-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the active assessment.

       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token that's used to fetch the next set of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Represents the maximum number of results on a page or for an API re-
          quest call.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       controlDomainInsights -> (list)
          The  control  domain  analytics  data  that the ListControlDomainIn-
          sightsByAssessment API returned.

          (structure)
              A summary of the latest analytics data for  a  specific  control
              domain.

              Control  domain  insights  are  grouped  by  control domain, and
              ranked by the highest total count of non-compliant evidence.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the control domain.

              id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the control domain.

              controlsCountByNoncompliantEvidence -> (integer)
                 The number of controls in the control domain  that  collected
                 non-compliant evidence on the lastUpdated date.

              totalControlsCount -> (integer)
                 The total number of controls in the control domain.

              evidenceInsights -> (structure)
                 A  breakdown  of the compliance check status for the evidence
                 thats associated with the control domain.

                 noncompliantEvidenceCount -> (integer)
                     The number of compliance check evidence that  Audit  Man-
                     ager  classified as non-compliant. This includes evidence
                     that was collected from Security Hub with a Fail  ruling,
                     or collected from Config with a Non-compliant ruling.

                 compliantEvidenceCount -> (integer)
                     The  number  of compliance check evidence that Audit Man-
                     ager classified as compliant. This includes evidence that
                     was  collected  from  Security Hub with a Pass ruling, or
                     collected from Config with a Compliant ruling.

                 inconclusiveEvidenceCount -> (integer)
                     The number of evidence that  a  compliance  check  ruling
                     isn't  available  for.  Evidence is inconclusive when the
                     associated control uses Security Hub or Config as a  data
                     source but you didn't enable those services. This is also
                     the case when a control uses a data  source  that  doesnt
                     support  compliance checks (for example, manual evidence,
                     API calls, or CloudTrail).

                     NOTE:
                        If evidence has a compliance check status of  not  ap-
                        plicable  in the console, it's classified as inconclu-
                        sive in EvidenceInsights data.

              lastUpdated -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the control domain insights were last updated.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token that's used to fetch the next set of results.
