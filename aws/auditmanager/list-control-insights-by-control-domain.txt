LIST-CONTROL-INSIGHTS-BY-CONTROL-DOMALIST-CONTROL-INSIGHTS-BY-CONTROL-DOMAIN()



NAME
       list-control-insights-by-control-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the latest analytics data for controls within a specific control
       domain across all active assessments.

       NOTE:
          Control insights are listed only if the control belongs to the  con-
          trol domain that was specified and the control collected evidence on
          the lastUpdated date of  controlInsightsMetadata  .  If  neither  of
          these conditions are met, no data is listed for that control.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-control-insights-by-control-domain
          --control-domain-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --control-domain-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the control domain.

       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token that's used to fetch the next set of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Represents the maximum number of results on a page or for an API re-
          quest call.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       controlInsightsMetadata -> (list)
          The  control analytics data that the ListControlInsightsByControlDo-
          main API returned.

          (structure)
              A summary of the latest analytics data for a specific control.

              This data reflects the total counts for  the  specified  control
              across  all  active assessments. Control insights are grouped by
              control domain,  and  ranked  by  the  highest  total  count  of
              non-compliant evidence.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the control.

              id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the control.

              evidenceInsights -> (structure)
                 A  breakdown  of the compliance check status for the evidence
                 thats associated with the control.

                 noncompliantEvidenceCount -> (integer)
                     The number of compliance check evidence that  Audit  Man-
                     ager  classified as non-compliant. This includes evidence
                     that was collected from Security Hub with a Fail  ruling,
                     or collected from Config with a Non-compliant ruling.

                 compliantEvidenceCount -> (integer)
                     The  number  of compliance check evidence that Audit Man-
                     ager classified as compliant. This includes evidence that
                     was  collected  from  Security Hub with a Pass ruling, or
                     collected from Config with a Compliant ruling.

                 inconclusiveEvidenceCount -> (integer)
                     The number of evidence that  a  compliance  check  ruling
                     isn't  available  for.  Evidence is inconclusive when the
                     associated control uses Security Hub or Config as a  data
                     source but you didn't enable those services. This is also
                     the case when a control uses a data  source  that  doesnt
                     support  compliance checks (for example, manual evidence,
                     API calls, or CloudTrail).

                     NOTE:
                        If evidence has a compliance check status of  not  ap-
                        plicable  in the console, it's classified as inconclu-
                        sive in EvidenceInsights data.

              lastUpdated -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the control insights were last updated.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token that's used to fetch the next set of results.
