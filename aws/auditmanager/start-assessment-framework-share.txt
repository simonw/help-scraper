NAME
       start-assessment-framework-share -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a share request for a custom framework in Audit Manager.

       The share request specifies a recipient and notifies them that a custom
       framework is available. Recipients have 120 days to accept  or  decline
       the request. If no action is taken, the share request expires.

       WARNING:
          When you invoke the StartAssessmentFrameworkShare API, you are about
          to share a custom framework with another  Amazon  Web  Services  ac-
          count.  You  may not share a custom framework that is derived from a
          standard framework if the standard framework is  designated  as  not
          eligible  for  sharing  by  Amazon Web Services, unless you have ob-
          tained permission to do so from the owner of the standard framework.
          To learn more about which standard frameworks are eligible for shar-
          ing, see Framework sharing eligibility in  the  Audit  Manager  User
          Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            start-assessment-framework-share
          --framework-id <value>
          --destination-account <value>
          --destination-region <value>
          [--comment <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --framework-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the custom framework to be shared.

       --destination-account (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account of the recipient.

       --destination-region (string)
          The Amazon Web Services Region of the recipient.

       --comment (string)
          An optional comment from the sender about the share request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
