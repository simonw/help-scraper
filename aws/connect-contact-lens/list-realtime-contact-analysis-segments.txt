NAME
       list-realtime-contact-analysis-segments -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides a list of analysis segments for a real-time analysis session.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-realtime-contact-analysis-segments
          --instance-id <value>
          --contact-id <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The identifier of the Amazon Connect instance.

       --contact-id (string)
          The identifier of the contact.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximimum number of results to return per page.

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of results. Use the value returned in the
          previous response in the next request to retrieve the  next  set  of
          results.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     The category rule that was matched and when  it  occurred
                     in the transcript.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Provides  information about the category rule that was
                        matched.

                        PointsOfInterest -> (list)
                            The section of audio where the category  rule  was
                            detected.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If there are additional results, this is the token for the next  set
          of  results.  If  response includes nextToken there are two possible
          scenarios:

          o There are more segments so another call is required to get them.

          o There are no more segments at this time, but more may be available
            later  (real-time  analysis  is  in progress) so the client should
            call the operation again to get new segments.

          If response does not include nextToken , the analysis  is  completed
          (successfully or failed) and there are no more segments to retrieve.
