UPDATE-USER-POOL()                                          UPDATE-USER-POOL()



NAME
       update-user-pool -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the specified user pool with the specified attributes. You can
       get a list of the current user pool settings using  DescribeUserPool  .
       If  you  don't  provide a value for an attribute, it will be set to the
       default value.

       NOTE:
          This action might generate an SMS text  message.  Starting  June  1,
          2021, U.S. telecom carriers require that you register an origination
          phone number before you can send SMS messages to U.S. phone numbers.
          If  you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a
          phone number with Amazon Pinpoint . Cognito will use the the  regis-
          tered  number  automatically. Otherwise, Cognito users that must re-
          ceive SMS messages might be unable to sign up,  activate  their  ac-
          counts, or sign in.

          If  you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any
          other Amazon Web Service, Amazon SNS might place your account in SMS
          sandbox. In * sandbox mode * , youll have limitations, such as send-
          ing messages to only verified phone numbers. After  testing  in  the
          sandbox  environment,  you  can move out of the SMS sandbox and into
          production. For more information, see SMS message settings for  Cog-
          nito User Pools in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for the user pool you want to update.

       --policies (structure)
          A container with the policies you wish to update in a user pool.

          PasswordPolicy -> (structure)
              The password policy.

              MinimumLength -> (integer)
                 The  minimum length of the password policy that you have set.
                 Cannot be less than 6.

              RequireUppercase -> (boolean)
                 In the password policy that you have set, refers  to  whether
                 you  have required users to use at least one uppercase letter
                 in their password.

              RequireLowercase -> (boolean)
                 In the password policy that you have set, refers  to  whether
                 you  have required users to use at least one lowercase letter
                 in their password.

              RequireNumbers -> (boolean)
                 In the password policy that you have set, refers  to  whether
                 you  have  required users to use at least one number in their
                 password.

              RequireSymbols -> (boolean)
                 In the password policy that you have set, refers  to  whether

                 In the password policy you have set, refers to the number  of
                 days  a  temporary  password  is  valid. If the user does not
                 sign-in during this time, their password will need to be  re-
                 set by an administrator.

                 NOTE:
                     When  you  set  TemporaryPasswordValidityDays  for a user
                     pool, you will no longer be able to  set  the  deprecated
                     UnusedAccountValidityDays value for that user pool.

              ways,   depending   on  the  value  that  you  specify  for  the
              EmailSendingAccount parameter:

              o If you specify COGNITO_DEFAULT , Amazon Cognito uses this  ad-
                dress  as the custom FROM address when it emails your users by
                using its built-in email account.

              o If you specify DEVELOPER , Amazon Cognito  emails  your  users
                with this address by calling Amazon SES on your behalf.

          ReplyToEmailAddress -> (string)
              The  destination to which the receiver of the email should reply
              to.

          EmailSendingAccount -> (string)
              Specifies whether Amazon Cognito emails your users by using  its
              built-in email functionality or your Amazon SES email configura-
              tion. Specify one of the following values:
                 COGNITO_DEFAULT

              When Amazon Cognito emails your  users,  it  uses  its  built-in
              email  functionality.  When  you  use the default option, Amazon
              Cognito allows only a limited number of emails each day for your
              user  pool.  For  typical  production  environments, the default
              email limit is below the required delivery volume. To achieve  a
              higher delivery volume, specify DEVELOPER to use your Amazon SES
              email configuration.

              To look up the email delivery limit for the default option,  see
              Limits in Amazon Cognito in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

              The  default  FROM address is no-reply@verificationemail.com. To
              customize the FROM address, provide the ARN  of  an  Amazon  SES
              verified email address for the SourceArn parameter.

              If EmailSendingAccount is COGNITO_DEFAULT, the following parame-
              ters aren't allowed:

              o EmailVerificationMessage

              o EmailVerificationSubject

              o InviteMessageTemplate.EmailMessage

              o InviteMessageTemplate.EmailSubject

              o VerificationMessageTemplate.EmailMessage

              o VerificationMessageTemplate.EmailMessageByLink

              o VerificationMessageTemplate.EmailSubject,

              o VerificationMessageTemplate.EmailSubjectByLink

              NOTE:
                 DEVELOPER EmailSendingAccount is required.

                 DEVELOPER

              When Amazon Cognito emails your users, it uses your  Amazon  SES
              configuration. Amazon Cognito calls Amazon SES on your behalf to
              send email from your verified email address. When you  use  this
              option, the email delivery limits are the same limits that apply
              to your Amazon SES verified email address in your account.

              If you use this option, you must provide the ARN  of  an  Amazon
              SES verified email address for the SourceArn parameter.

              Before  Amazon  Cognito  can email your users, it requires addi-
              tional permissions to call Amazon SES on your behalf.  When  you
              update your user pool with this option, Amazon Cognito creates a
              service-linked role , which is a type of IAM role, in  your  ac-
              count. This role contains the permissions that allow Amazon Cog-
              nito to access Amazon SES and send email messages with your  ad-
              dress.  For  more information about the service-linked role that
              Amazon Cognito creates, see Using Service-Linked Roles for  Ama-
              zon Cognito in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          From -> (string)
              Identifies  either the senders email address or the senders name
              with their email address. For example,  testuser@example.com  or
              Test  User <testuser@example.com> . This address will appear be-
              fore the body of the email.

          ConfigurationSet -> (string)
              The set of configuration rules that can  be  applied  to  emails
              sent  using  Amazon  SES.  A  configuration set is applied to an
              email by including a reference to the configuration set  in  the
              headers  of  the  email.  Once applied, all of the rules in that
              configuration set are applied to the email.  Configuration  sets
              can be used to apply the following types of rules to emails:

              o Event publishing  Amazon SES can track the number of send, de-
                livery, open, click, bounce, and  complaint  events  for  each
                email  sent.  Use  event  publishing to send information about
                these events to other Amazon Web Services services such as SNS
                and CloudWatch.

              o IP  pool  management  When leasing dedicated IP addresses with
                Amazon SES, you can create groups of IP addresses, called ded-
                icated IP pools. You can then associate the dedicated IP pools
                with configuration sets.

          }

       --sms-configuration (structure)
          SMS configuration.

          SnsCallerArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Simple Notification
              Service  (SNS)  caller.  This is the ARN of the IAM role in your
              account which Cognito will use to send SMS  messages.  SMS  mes-
              sages are subject to a spending limit .

          ExternalId -> (string)
              The  external ID is a value that we recommend you use to add se-
              curity to your IAM role which is used to call Amazon SNS to send
              SMS  messages for your user pool. If you provide an ExternalId ,
              the Cognito User Pool will include it when attempting to  assume
              your  IAM  role,  so that you can set your roles trust policy to
              require the ExternalID . If you use the Cognito Management  Con-
              sole  to  create  a role for SMS MFA, Cognito will create a role
              with the required permissions and a  trust  policy  that  demon-
              strates use of the ExternalId .

              For  more information about the ExternalId of a role, see How to
              use an external ID when granting access to your Amazon Web  Ser-

          SnsCallerArn=string,ExternalId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SnsCallerArn": "string",
            "ExternalId": "string"
          }

       --user-pool-tags (map)
          The tag keys and values to assign to the user pool. A tag is a label
          that you can use to categorize and manage user  pools  in  different
          ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --admin-create-user-config (structure)
          The configuration for AdminCreateUser requests.

          AllowAdminCreateUserOnly -> (boolean)
              Set  to True if only the administrator is allowed to create user
              profiles. Set to False if users can sign themselves  up  via  an
              app.

          UnusedAccountValidityDays -> (integer)
              The  user account expiration limit, in days, after which the ac-
              count is no longer usable. To reset the account after that  time
              limit,  you must call AdminCreateUser again, specifying "RESEND"
              for the MessageAction parameter. The default value for this  pa-
              rameter is 7.

              NOTE:
                 If you set a value for TemporaryPasswordValidityDays in Pass-
                 wordPolicy , that value will be used and UnusedAccountValidi-
                 tyDays will be deprecated for that user pool.

          InviteMessageTemplate -> (structure)
              The  message  template to be used for the welcome message to new
              users.

              See also Customizing User Invitation Messages .

              SMSMessage -> (string)
                 The message template for SMS messages.

              EmailMessage -> (string)
                 The message template for email messages. EmailMessage is  al-
                 lowed only if EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER.

              EmailSubject -> (string)
                 The  subject line for email messages. EmailSubject is allowed
                 only if EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AllowAdminCreateUserOnly=boolean,UnusedAccountValidityDays=integer,InviteMessageTemplate={SMSMessage=string,EmailMessage=string,EmailSubject=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AllowAdminCreateUserOnly": true|false,
            "UnusedAccountValidityDays": integer,
            "InviteMessageTemplate": {
              "SMSMessage": "string",
              "EmailMessage": "string",
              "EmailSubject": "string"
            }
          }

       --user-pool-add-ons (structure)
          Used to enable advanced security risk detection.  Set  the  key  Ad-
          vancedSecurityMode to the value "AUDIT".

          AdvancedSecurityMode -> (string)
              The advanced security mode.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AdvancedSecurityMode=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AdvancedSecurityMode": "OFF"|"AUDIT"|"ENFORCED"
          }

       --account-recovery-setting (structure)
          Use  this  setting  to define which verified available method a user
          can use to recover their password when they call ForgotPassword . It
          allows  you  to  define a preferred method when a user has more than
          one method available. With this setting, SMS does not qualify for  a
          valid  password  recovery mechanism if the user also has SMS MFA en-
          abled. In the absence of this setting, Cognito uses the  legacy  be-
          havior  to determine the recovery method where SMS is preferred over
          email.

          RecoveryMechanisms -> (list)
              The list of RecoveryOptionTypes .

              (structure)
                 A map containing a priority as a  key,  and  recovery  method
                 name as a value.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     A positive integer specifying priority of a method with 1
                     being the highest priority.

                 Name -> (string)
                     Specifies the recovery method for a user.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RecoveryMechanisms=[{Priority=integer,Name=string},{Priority=integer,Name=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RecoveryMechanisms": [
              {
                "Priority": integer,
                "Name": "verified_email"|"verified_phone_number"|"admin_only"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
