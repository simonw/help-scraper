NAME
       describe-user-pool-client -

DESCRIPTION
       Client  method for returning the configuration information and metadata
       of the specified user pool app client.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-user-pool-client
          --user-pool-id <value>
          --client-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for the user pool you want to describe.

       --client-id (string)
          The app client ID of the app associated with the user pool.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          AccessTokenValidity -> (integer)
              The time limit, specified by tokenValidityUnits,  defaulting  to
              hours,  after which the access token is no longer valid and can-
              not be used.

              respective token.

              AccessToken -> (string)
                 A  time unit in seconds, minutes, hours or days for the value
                 in AccessTokenValidity, defaults to hours.

              (string)

          ExplicitAuthFlows -> (list)
              The authentication flows that are supported  by  the  user  pool
              clients.  Flow names without the ALLOW_ prefix are deprecated in
              favor of new names with the ALLOW_ prefix. Note that values with
              ALLOW_  prefix  cannot  be used along with values without ALLOW_
              prefix.

              Valid values include:

              o ALLOW_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH : Enable admin based user pass-
                word  authentication flow ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH . This set-
                ting replaces the ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH setting. With this authen-
                tication  flow,  Cognito  receives the password in the request
                instead of using the SRP  (Secure  Remote  Password  protocol)
                protocol to verify passwords.

              o ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH  :  Enable  Lambda trigger based authentica-
                tion.

              o ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH : Enable user password-based  authen-
                tication.  In  this flow, Cognito receives the password in the
                request instead of using the SRP protocol to verify passwords.

              o ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH : Enable SRP based authentication.

              o ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH : Enable authflow to refresh tokens.

              (string)

          SupportedIdentityProviders -> (list)
              A list of provider names for the  identity  providers  that  are
              supported on this client.

              (string)

          CallbackURLs -> (list)
              A  list  of  allowed  redirect  (callback) URLs for the identity
              providers.

              A redirect URI must:

              o Be an absolute URI.

              o Be registered with the authorization server.

              o Not include a fragment component.

              See OAuth 2.0 - Redirection Endpoint .

              Amazon   Cognito   requires   HTTPS   over   HTTP   except   for
              http://localhost for testing purposes only.

              App callback URLs such as myapp://example are also supported.

              (string)

          LogoutURLs -> (list)
              A list of allowed logout URLs for the identity providers.

              (string)

          DefaultRedirectURI -> (string)

              See OAuth 2.0 - Redirection Endpoint .

              Amazon   Cognito   requires   HTTPS   over   HTTP   except   for
              http://localhost for testing purposes only.

              App callback URLs such as myapp://example are also supported.

          AllowedOAuthFlows -> (list)
              The allowed OAuth flows.

              Set to code to initiate a code grant flow, which provides an au-
              thorization code as the response. This code can be exchanged for
              access tokens with the token endpoint.

              Set to implicit to specify that the client should get the access
              token (and, optionally, ID token, based on scopes) directly.

              Set  to client_credentials to specify that the client should get
              the access token (and, optionally, ID token,  based  on  scopes)
              from  the  token  endpoint  using  a  combination  of client and
              client_secret.

              by Amazon Web Services are: aws.cognito.signin.user.admin . Cus-
              tom scopes created in Resource Servers are also supported.

              (string)

          AllowedOAuthFlowsUserPoolClient -> (boolean)
              Set  to true if the client is allowed to follow the OAuth proto-
              col when interacting with Cognito user pools.

          AnalyticsConfiguration -> (structure)
              The Amazon Pinpoint analytics configuration for  the  user  pool
              client.

              NOTE:
                 Cognito  User  Pools  only  supports sending events to Amazon
                 Pinpoint projects in the US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1  Re-
                 gion,  regardless  of  the  region in which the user pool re-
                 sides.

              ApplicationId -> (string)
                 The application ID for an Amazon Pinpoint application.

              ApplicationArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon Pinpoint project.
                 You can use the Amazon Pinpoint project for Pinpoint integra-
                 tion with the chosen User Pool Client.  Amazon  Cognito  pub-
                 lishes  events  to  the  pinpoint project declared by the app
                 ARN.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of an IAM role that authorizes Amazon Cognito to pub-
                 lish events to Amazon Pinpoint analytics.

              ExternalId -> (string)
                 The external ID.

              UserDataShared -> (boolean)
                 If  UserDataShared is true , Amazon Cognito will include user
                 data in the events it publishes to Amazon Pinpoint analytics.

          PreventUserExistenceErrors -> (string)
              Use this setting to choose which errors and  responses  are  re-
              turned  by Cognito APIs during authentication, account confirma-
              tion, and password recovery when the user does not exist in  the
              user  pool. When set to ENABLED and the user does not exist, au-
              thentication returns an error indicating either the username  or
              password  was  incorrect,  and account confirmation and password
              recovery return a response indicating a code was sent to a simu-
              lated destination. When set to LEGACY , those APIs will return a
              UserNotFoundException exception if the user does  not  exist  in
              the user pool.

              Valid values include:

              o ENABLED - This prevents user existence-related errors.

              o LEGACY  -  This  represents  the old behavior of Cognito where
                user existence related errors are not prevented.

              NOTE:
                 After February  15th  2020,  the  value  of  PreventUserExis-
                 tenceErrors  will  default  to ENABLED for newly created user
                 pool clients if no value is provided.

          EnableTokenRevocation -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether token revocation is enabled for the user  pool
              client. When you create a new user pool client, token revocation
              is enabled by default. For more information about  revoking  to-
              kens, see RevokeToken .
