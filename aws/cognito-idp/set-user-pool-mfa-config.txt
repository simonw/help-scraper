SET-USER-POOL-MFA-CONFIG()                          SET-USER-POOL-MFA-CONFIG()



NAME
       set-user-pool-mfa-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Set the user pool multi-factor authentication (MFA) configuration.

       NOTE:
          This  action  might  generate  an SMS text message. Starting June 1,
          2021, U.S. telecom carriers require that you register an origination
          phone number before you can send SMS messages to U.S. phone numbers.
          If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register  a
          phone  number with Amazon Pinpoint . Cognito will use the the regis-
          tered number automatically. Otherwise, Cognito users that  must  re-
          ceive  SMS  messages  might be unable to sign up, activate their ac-
          counts, or sign in.

          If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or  any
          other Amazon Web Service, Amazon SNS might place your account in SMS
          sandbox. In * sandbox mode * , youll have limitations, such as send-
          ing  messages  to  only verified phone numbers. After testing in the
          sandbox environment, you can move out of the SMS  sandbox  and  into
          production.  For more information, see SMS message settings for Cog-
          nito User Pools in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            set-user-pool-mfa-config
          --user-pool-id <value>
          [--sms-mfa-configuration <value>]
          [--software-token-mfa-configuration <value>]
          [--mfa-configuration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID.

       --sms-mfa-configuration (structure)
          The SMS text message MFA configuration.

          SmsAuthenticationMessage -> (string)
              The SMS authentication message that will be sent to  users  with
              the  code  they  need  to  sign in. The message must contain the
              {####} placeholder, which will be replaced with the code. If the
              message is not included, and default message will be used.

          SmsConfiguration -> (structure)
              The SMS configuration.

              SnsCallerArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Simple Notifica-
                 tion Service (SNS) caller. This is the ARN of the IAM role in
                 your account which Cognito will use to send SMS messages. SMS
                 messages are subject to a spending limit .

              ExternalId -> (string)
                 The external ID is a value that we recommend you use  to  add
                 security to your IAM role which is used to call Amazon SNS to
                 send SMS messages for your user pool. If you provide  an  Ex-
                 ternalId  ,  the  Cognito  User Pool will include it when at-
                 tempting to assume your IAM role, so that you  can  set  your
                 roles trust policy to require the ExternalID . If you use the
                 Cognito Management Console to create a role for SMS MFA, Cog-
                 nito  will  create a role with the required permissions and a
                 trust policy that demonstrates use of the ExternalId .

                 For more information about the ExternalId of a role, see  How
                 to use an external ID when granting access to your Amazon Web
                 Services resources to a third party

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SmsAuthenticationMessage=string,SmsConfiguration={SnsCallerArn=string,ExternalId=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SmsAuthenticationMessage": "string",
            "SmsConfiguration": {
              "SnsCallerArn": "string",
              "ExternalId": "string"
            }
          }

       --software-token-mfa-configuration (structure)
          The software token MFA configuration.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether software token MFA is enabled.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Enabled=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Enabled": true|false
          }

       --mfa-configuration (string)
          The MFA configuration. Users who don't have an  MFA  factor  set  up
          won't  be  able  to sign-in if you set the MfaConfiguration value to
          ON. See Adding Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to a User  Pool  to
          learn more. Valid values include:

          o OFF MFA will not be used for any users.

          o ON MFA is required for all users to sign in.

          o OPTIONAL  MFA  will be required only for individual users who have
            an MFA factor enabled.

          Possible values:

          o OFF

          o ON

          o OPTIONAL

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
