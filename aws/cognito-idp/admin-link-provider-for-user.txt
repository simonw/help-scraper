ADMIN-LINK-PROVIDER-FOR-USER()                  ADMIN-LINK-PROVIDER-FOR-USER()



NAME
       admin-link-provider-for-user -

DESCRIPTION
       Links  an existing user account in a user pool (DestinationUser ) to an
       identity from an external identity provider (SourceUser )  based  on  a
       specified attribute name and value from the external identity provider.
       This allows you to create a link from the existing user account  to  an
       external federated user identity that has not yet been used to sign in.
       You can then use the federated user identity to sign in as the existing
       user account.

       For example, if there is an existing user with a username and password,
       this API links that user to a federated user identity.  When  the  user
       signs  in  with a federated user identity, they sign in as the existing
       user account.

       NOTE:
          The maximum number of federated identities linked to a user is 5.

       WARNING:
          Because this API allows a user with an external  federated  identity
          to sign in as an existing user in the user pool, it is critical that
          it only be used with external identity providers  and  provider  at-
          tributes that have been trusted by the application owner.

       This action is administrative and requires developer credentials.

SYNOPSIS
            admin-link-provider-for-user
          --user-pool-id <value>
          --destination-user <value>
          --source-user <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for the user pool.

       --destination-user (structure)
          The  existing  user  in  the  user pool to be linked to the external
          identity provider user account. Can be a native  (Username  +  Pass-
          word)  Amazon Cognito User Pools user or a federated user (for exam-
          ple, a SAML or Facebook user). If the user doesn't exist, an  excep-
          tion  is thrown. This is the user that is returned when the new user
          (with the linked identity provider attribute) signs in.

          For a native username + password  user,  the  ProviderAttributeValue
          for the DestinationUser should be the username in the user pool. For
          a federated user, it should be the provider-specific user_id .

          The ProviderAttributeName of the DestinationUser is ignored.

          The ProviderName should be set to Cognito for users in Cognito  user
          pools.

          WARNING:
              All  attributes  in the DestinationUser profile must be mutable.
              If you have assigned the user any immutable  custom  attributes,
              the operation won't succeed.

          ProviderName -> (string)
              The  name  of  the  provider, such as Facebook, Google, or Login
              with Amazon.

          ProviderAttributeName -> (string)
              The name of the provider attribute to link to, such as NameID .

          ProviderAttributeValue -> (string)
              The value  of  the  provider  attribute  to  link  to,  such  as
              xxxxx_account .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ProviderName=string,ProviderAttributeName=string,ProviderAttributeValue=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ProviderName": "string",
            "ProviderAttributeName": "string",
            "ProviderAttributeValue": "string"
          }

       --source-user (structure)
          An  external  identity provider account for a user who doesn't exist
          yet in the user pool. This user must be a federated user (for  exam-
          ple, a SAML or Facebook user), not another native user.

          If  the  SourceUser  is  using a federated social identity provider,
          such as Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon,  you  must  set  the
          ProviderAttributeName  to  Cognito_Subject  .  For  social  identity
          providers, the ProviderName will be Facebook , Google  ,  or  Login-
          WithAmazon  ,  and Amazon Cognito will automatically parse the Face-
          book, Google, and Login with Amazon  tokens  for  id  ,  sub  ,  and
          user_id , respectively. The ProviderAttributeValue for the user must
          be the same value as the id , sub , or user_id value  found  in  the
          social identity provider token.

          For  SAML, the ProviderAttributeName can be any value that matches a
          claim in the SAML assertion. If you want to link SAML users based on
          the  subject  of the SAML assertion, you should map the subject to a
          claim through the SAML identity provider and submit that claim  name
          as  the  ProviderAttributeName . If you set ProviderAttributeName to
          Cognito_Subject , Amazon Cognito will automatically  parse  the  de-
          fault unique identifier found in the subject from the SAML token.

          ProviderName -> (string)
              The  name  of  the  provider, such as Facebook, Google, or Login
              with Amazon.

          ProviderAttributeName -> (string)
              The name of the provider attribute to link to, such as NameID .

          ProviderAttributeValue -> (string)
              The value  of  the  provider  attribute  to  link  to,  such  as
              xxxxx_account .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ProviderName=string,ProviderAttributeName=string,ProviderAttributeValue=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ProviderName": "string",
            "ProviderAttributeName": "string",
            "ProviderAttributeValue": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
