ADMIN-UPDATE-USER-ATTRIBUTES()                  ADMIN-UPDATE-USER-ATTRIBUTES()



NAME
       admin-update-user-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  specified  user's  attributes,  including  developer  at-
       tributes, as an administrator. Works on any user.

       For custom attributes, you must prepend the custom: prefix to  the  at-
       tribute name.

       In  addition  to updating user attributes, this API can also be used to
       mark phone and email as verified.

       NOTE:
          This action might generate an SMS text  message.  Starting  June  1,
          2021,  US  telecom  carriers  require you to register an origination
          phone number before you can send SMS messages to U.S. phone numbers.
          If  you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a
          phone number with Amazon Pinpoint . Amazon Cognito will use the reg-
          istered  number  automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users that
          must receive SMS messages might be unable to sign up, activate their
          accounts, or sign in.

          If  you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any
          other Amazon Web Service, Amazon Simple Notification  Service  might
          place  your  account  in SMS sandbox. In * sandbox mode * , you will
          have limitations, such as sending messages only  to  verified  phone
          numbers.  After testing in the sandbox environment, you can move out
          of the SMS sandbox and into production. For  more  information,  see
          SMS  message  settings  for  Amazon Cognito User Pools in the Amazon
          Cognito Developer Guide .

       Calling this action requires developer credentials.

SYNOPSIS
            admin-update-user-attributes
          --user-pool-id <value>
          --username <value>
          --user-attributes <value>
          [--client-metadata <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for the user pool where you want to update user at-
          tributes.

       --username (string)
          The  user  name  of  the  user  for whom you want to update user at-
          tributes.

       --user-attributes (list)
          An array of name-value pairs representing user attributes.

          For custom attributes, you must prepend the custom:  prefix  to  the
          attribute name.

          (structure)
              Specifies whether the attribute is standard or custom.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the attribute.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the attribute.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-metadata (map)
          A  map  of  custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for
          any custom workflows that this action triggers.

          You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda  functions  to  user
          pool  triggers.  When  you use the AdminUpdateUserAttributes API ac-
          tion, Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is  assigned  to  the
          custom  message  trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function,
          it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This
          payload contains a clientMetadata attribute, which provides the data
          that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your AdminUpda-
          teUserAttributes  request.  In your function code in Lambda, you can
          process the clientMetadata value to enhance your workflow  for  your
          specific needs.

          For  more  information,  see  Customizing  User  Pool Workflows with
          Lambda Triggers in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              When you use the ClientMetadata parameter, remember that  Amazon
              Cognito won't do the following:

              o Store the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to
                Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user  pool  to  support
                custom  workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't in-
                clude triggers, the ClientMetadata parameter  serves  no  pur-
                pose.

              o Validate the ClientMetadata value.

              o Encrypt  the ClientMetadata value. Don't use Amazon Cognito to
                provide sensitive information.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
