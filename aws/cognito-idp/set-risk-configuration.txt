NAME
       set-risk-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Configures  actions on detected risks. To delete the risk configuration
       for UserPoolId or ClientId , pass null values for all  four  configura-
       tion types.

       To  enable  Amazon  Cognito advanced security features, update the user
       pool to include the UserPoolAddOns key``AdvancedSecurityMode`` .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            set-risk-configuration
          --user-pool-id <value>
          [--client-id <value>]
          [--compromised-credentials-risk-configuration <value>]
          [--account-takeover-risk-configuration <value>]
          [--risk-exception-configuration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID.

       --client-id (string)
          The app client ID. If ClientId is null, then the risk  configuration
          is  mapped to userPoolId . When the client ID is null, the same risk
          configuration is applied to all the clients in the userPool.

          Otherwise, ClientId is mapped to the client. When the client  ID  is
          not  null,  the  user  pool configuration is overridden and the risk
          configuration for the client is used instead.

       --compromised-credentials-risk-configuration (structure)
          The compromised credentials risk configuration.

          EventFilter -> (list)
              Perform the action for these events. The default is  to  perform
              all events if no event filter is specified.

              (string)

          Actions -> (structure)
              The compromised credentials risk configuration actions.

              EventAction -> (string)
                 The event action.

       --risk-exception-configuration (structure)
          The configuration to override the risk decision.

          BlockedIPRangeList -> (list)
              Overrides  the risk decision to always block the pre-authentica-
              tion requests. The IP range is in CIDR notation: a compact  rep-
              resentation of an IP address and its associated routing prefix.

              (string)

          SkippedIPRangeList -> (list)

              list. The IP range is in CIDR notation.

              (string)

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
