ADMIN-CREATE-USER()                                        ADMIN-CREATE-USER()



NAME
       admin-create-user -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new user in the specified user pool.

       If  MessageAction  is not set, the default is to send a welcome message
       via email or phone (SMS).

       NOTE:
          This action might generate an SMS text  message.  Starting  June  1,
          2021, U.S. telecom carriers require that you register an origination
          phone number before you can send SMS messages to U.S. phone numbers.
          If  you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a
          phone number with Amazon Pinpoint . Cognito will use the the  regis-
          tered  number  automatically. Otherwise, Cognito users that must re-
          ceive SMS messages might be unable to sign up,  activate  their  ac-
          counts, or sign in.

          If  you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any
          other Amazon Web Service, Amazon SNS might place your account in SMS
          sandbox. In * sandbox mode * , youll have limitations, such as send-
          ing messages to only verified phone numbers. After  testing  in  the
          sandbox  environment,  you  can move out of the SMS sandbox and into
          production. For more information, see SMS message settings for  Cog-
          nito User Pools in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

       This message is based on a template that you configured in your call to
       create or update a  user  pool.  This  template  includes  your  custom
       sign-up instructions and placeholders for user name and temporary pass-
       word.

       Alternatively, you can call AdminCreateUser with SUPPRESS for the  Mes-
       sageAction parameter, and Amazon Cognito will not send any email.

       In either case, the user will be in the FORCE_CHANGE_PASSWORD state un-
       til they sign in and change their password.
          AdminCreateUser requires developer credentials.

            admin-create-user
          --user-pool-id <value>
          --username <value>
          [--user-attributes <value>]
          [--validation-data <value>]
          [--temporary-password <value>]
          [--force-alias-creation | --no-force-alias-creation]
          [--message-action <value>]
          [--desired-delivery-mediums <value>]
          [--client-metadata <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for the user pool where the user will be created.

       --username (string)
          The username for the user. Must be unique within the user pool. Must
          be  a  UTF-8  string between 1 and 128 characters. After the user is
          created, the username cannot be changed.

       --user-attributes (list)
          An array of name-value pairs that contain user attributes and attri-
          bute  values  to be set for the user to be created. You can create a
          user without specifying any attributes other than  Username  .  How-
          ever,  any  attributes that you specify as required (when creating a
          user pool or in the Attributes tab of the console) must be  supplied
          either  by  you  (in  your  call to AdminCreateUser ) or by the user
          (when he or she signs up in response to your welcome message).

          For custom attributes, you must prepend the custom:  prefix  to  the
          attribute name.

          To send a message inviting the user to sign up, you must specify the
          user's email address or phone number. This can be done in your  call
          to AdminCreateUser or in the Users tab of the Amazon Cognito console
          for managing your user pools.

          In your call to AdminCreateUser , you can set the email_verified at-
          tribute  to  True , and you can set the phone_number_verified attri-
          bute   to   True   .   (You   can   also   do   this   by    calling
          AdminUpdateUserAttributes .)

          o email  :  The  email  address of the user to whom the message that
            contains the code and username  will  be  sent.  Required  if  the
            email_verified  attribute is set to True , or if "EMAIL" is speci-
            fied in the DesiredDeliveryMediums parameter.

          o phone_number : The phone number of the user to  whom  the  message
            that  contains the code and username will be sent. Required if the
            phone_number_verified attribute is set to True , or  if  "SMS"  is
            specified in the DesiredDeliveryMediums parameter.

          (structure)
              Specifies whether the attribute is standard or custom.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the attribute.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the attribute.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --validation-data (list)
          The  user's  validation  data.  This is an array of name-value pairs
          that contain user attributes and attribute values that you  can  use
          for  custom  validation,  such  as restricting the types of user ac-
          counts that can be registered. For example, you might choose to  al-
          low or disallow user sign-up based on the user's domain.

          To configure custom validation, you must create a Pre Sign-up Lambda
          trigger for the user pool as described in the Amazon Cognito  Devel-
          oper Guide. The Lambda trigger receives the validation data and uses
          it in the validation process.

          The user's validation data is not persisted.

          (structure)
              Specifies whether the attribute is standard or custom.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the attribute.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the attribute.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --temporary-password (string)
          The user's temporary password. This password  must  conform  to  the
          password policy that you specified when you created the user pool.

          The  temporary  password  is  valid only once. To complete the Admin
          Create User flow, the user must enter the temporary password in  the
          sign-in  page  along  with  a  new password to be used in all future
          sign-ins.

          This parameter is not required. If you do not specify a value,  Ama-
          zon Cognito generates one for you.

          The temporary password can only be used until the user account expi-
          ration limit that you specified when you created the user  pool.  To
          reset  the  account  after that time limit, you must call AdminCrea-
          teUser again, specifying "RESEND" for the MessageAction parameter.

       --force-alias-creation | --no-force-alias-creation (boolean)
          This  parameter  is  only  used  if  the  phone_number_verified   or
          email_verified attribute is set to True . Otherwise, it is ignored.

          If  this  parameter is set to True and the phone number or email ad-
          dress specified in the UserAttributes parameter already exists as an
          alias  with  a  different  user, the API call will migrate the alias
          from the previous user to the newly created user. The previous  user
          will no longer be able to log in using that alias.

          If this parameter is set to False , the API throws an AliasExistsEx-
          ception error if the alias already  exists.  The  default  value  is
          False .

       --message-action (string)
          Set  to "RESEND" to resend the invitation message to a user that al-
          ready exists and reset the expiration limit on the  user's  account.
          Set  to  "SUPPRESS"  to suppress sending the message. Only one value
          can be specified.

          Possible values:

          o RESEND

          o SUPPRESS

       --desired-delivery-mediums (list)
          Specify "EMAIL" if email will be used to send the  welcome  message.
          Specify "SMS" if the phone number will be used. The default value is
          "SMS" . More than one value can be specified.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            SMS
            EMAIL

       --client-metadata (map)
          A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide  as  input  for
          any custom workflows that this action triggers.

          You  create  custom  workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user
          pool triggers. When you use the AdminCreateUser API  action,  Amazon
          Cognito  invokes  the  function  that is assigned to the pre sign-up
          trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON
          payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains
          a clientMetadata attribute, which provides the  data  that  you  as-
          signed  to  the ClientMetadata parameter in your AdminCreateUser re-
          quest. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the  client-
          Metadata value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

          For  more  information,  see  Customizing  User  Pool Workflows with
          Lambda Triggers in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              Take the following limitations into consideration when  you  use
              the ClientMetadata parameter:

              o Amazon  Cognito  does not store the ClientMetadata value. This
                data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to
                a  user  pool  to  support custom workflows. If your user pool
                configuration does not include  triggers,  the  ClientMetadata
                parameter serves no purpose.

              o Amazon Cognito does not validate the ClientMetadata value.

              o Amazon  Cognito does not encrypt the the ClientMetadata value,
                so don't use it to provide sensitive information.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
