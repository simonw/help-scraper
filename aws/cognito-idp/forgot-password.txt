FORGOT-PASSWORD()                                            FORGOT-PASSWORD()



NAME
       forgot-password -

DESCRIPTION
       Calling  this  API  causes  a message to be sent to the end user with a
       confirmation code that is required to change the user's  password.  For
       the  Username  parameter,  you  can use the username or user alias. The
       method used to send the confirmation code  is  sent  according  to  the
       specified  AccountRecoverySetting. For more information, see Recovering
       User Accounts in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide . If neither a ver-
       ified  phone number nor a verified email exists, an InvalidParameterEx-
       ception is thrown. To use the confirmation code for resetting the pass-
       word, call ConfirmForgotPassword .

       NOTE:
          This  action  might  generate  an SMS text message. Starting June 1,
          2021, US telecom carriers require you  to  register  an  origination
          phone number before you can send SMS messages to U.S. phone numbers.
          If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register  a
          phone number with Amazon Pinpoint . Amazon Cognito will use the reg-
          istered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito  users  that
          must receive SMS messages might be unable to sign up, activate their
          accounts, or sign in.

          If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or  any
          other  Amazon  Web Service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might
          place your account in SMS sandbox. In * sandbox mode *  ,  you  will
          have  limitations,  such  as sending messages only to verified phone
          numbers. After testing in the sandbox environment, you can move  out
          of  the  SMS  sandbox and into production. For more information, see
          SMS message settings for Amazon Cognito User  Pools  in  the  Amazon
          Cognito Developer Guide .

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-id (string)
          The ID of the client associated with the user pool.

       --secret-hash (string)
          A keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) calculated using the
          secret key of a user pool client and username plus the client ID  in
          the message.

       --user-context-data (structure)
          Contextual  data  such as the user's device fingerprint, IP address,
          or location used for evaluating the risk of an unexpected  event  by
          Amazon Cognito advanced security.

          EncodedData -> (string)
              Contextual  data,  such as the user's device fingerprint, IP ad-
              dress, or location, used for evaluating the  risk  of  an  unex-
              pected event by Amazon Cognito advanced security.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EncodedData=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "EncodedData": "string"
          }

       --username (string)
          The user name of the user for whom you want to enter a code to reset
          a forgotten password.

       --analytics-metadata (structure)
          The Amazon Pinpoint analytics metadata for  collecting  metrics  for
          ForgotPassword calls.

          AnalyticsEndpointId -> (string)
              The endpoint ID.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AnalyticsEndpointId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AnalyticsEndpointId": "string"
          }

       --client-metadata (map)
          A  map  of  custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for
          any custom workflows that this action triggers.

          You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda  functions  to  user
          pool  triggers.  When  you use the ForgotPassword API action, Amazon
          Cognito invokes any functions that are  assigned  to  the  following
          triggers:  pre  sign-up , custom message , and user migration . When
          Amazon Cognito invokes any of these functions, it passes a JSON pay-
          load,  which the function receives as input. This payload contains a
          clientMetadata attribute, which provides the data that you  assigned
          to  the  ClientMetadata parameter in your ForgotPassword request. In
          your function code in Lambda, you  can  process  the  clientMetadata
          value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

          For  more  information,  see  Customizing  User  Pool Workflows with
          Lambda Triggers in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              When you use the ClientMetadata parameter, remember that  Amazon
              Cognito won't do the following:

              o Store the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to
                Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user  pool  to  support
                custom  workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't in-
                clude triggers, the ClientMetadata parameter  serves  no  pur-
                pose.

              o Validate the ClientMetadata value.

              o Encrypt  the ClientMetadata value. Don't use Amazon Cognito to
                provide sensitive information.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
