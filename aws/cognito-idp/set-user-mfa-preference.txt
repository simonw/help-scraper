SET-USER-MFA-PREFERENCE()                            SET-USER-MFA-PREFERENCE()



NAME
       set-user-mfa-preference -

DESCRIPTION
       Set the user's multi-factor authentication (MFA) method preference, in-
       cluding which MFA factors are activated and if any are preferred.  Only
       one  factor  can  be set as preferred. The preferred MFA factor will be
       used to authenticate a user if multiple factors are activated. If  mul-
       tiple  options  are  activated and no preference is set, a challenge to
       choose an MFA option will be returned during sign-in. If an MFA type is
       activated  for  a  user,  the  user will be prompted for MFA during all
       sign-in attempts unless device tracking is turned on and the device has
       been  trusted.  If  you want MFA to be applied selectively based on the
       assessed risk level of sign-in attempts, deactivate MFA for  users  and
       turn on Adaptive Authentication for the user pool.

SYNOPSIS
            set-user-mfa-preference
          [--sms-mfa-settings <value>]
          [--software-token-mfa-settings <value>]
          --access-token <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --sms-mfa-settings (structure)
          The SMS text message multi-factor authentication (MFA) settings.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  SMS text message MFA is activated. If an MFA
              type is activated for a user, the user will be prompted for  MFA
              during all sign-in attempts, unless device tracking is turned on
              and the device has been trusted.

          PreferredMfa -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether SMS is the preferred MFA method.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Enabled=boolean,PreferredMfa=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Enabled": true|false,
            "PreferredMfa": true|false
          }

       --software-token-mfa-settings (structure)
          The time-based one-time password software token MFA settings.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether software token MFA is  activated.  If  an  MFA
              type  is activated for a user, the user will be prompted for MFA
              during all sign-in attempts, unless device tracking is turned on
              and the device has been trusted.

          PreferredMfa -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  software  token  MFA  is  the  preferred MFA
              method.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Enabled=boolean,PreferredMfa=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Enabled": true|false,
            "PreferredMfa": true|false
          }

       --access-token (string)
          The access token for the user.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To set user MFA settings

       This  example modifies the MFA delivery options. It changes the MFA de-
       livery medium to SMS.

       Command:

          aws cognito-idp set-user-mfa-preference --access-token ACCESS_TOKEN --mfa-options DeliveryMedium="SMS",AttributeName="phone_number"

OUTPUT
       None
