NAME
       admin-respond-to-auth-challenge -

DESCRIPTION
       Responds to an authentication challenge, as an administrator.

       NOTE:
          This  action  might  generate  an SMS text message. Starting June 1,
          2021, US telecom carriers require you  to  register  an  origination
          phone number before you can send SMS messages to U.S. phone numbers.
          If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register  a
          phone number with Amazon Pinpoint . Amazon Cognito will use the reg-
          istered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito  users  that
          must receive SMS messages might be unable to sign up, activate their
          accounts, or sign in.

          If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or  any
          other  Amazon  Web Service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might
          place your account in SMS sandbox. In * sandbox mode *  ,  you  will
          have  limitations,  such  as sending messages only to verified phone
          numbers. After testing in the sandbox environment, you can move  out
          of  the  SMS  sandbox and into production. For more information, see
          SMS message settings for Amazon Cognito User  Pools  in  the  Amazon
          Cognito Developer Guide .

       Calling this action requires developer credentials.

SYNOPSIS
            admin-respond-to-auth-challenge
          --user-pool-id <value>
          --client-id <value>
          --challenge-name <value>
          [--challenge-responses <value>]
          [--session <value>]
          [--analytics-metadata <value>]
          [--context-data <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Cognito user pool.

       --client-id (string)
          The app client ID.

       --challenge-name (string)
          The challenge name. For more information, see AdminInitiateAuth .

          Possible values:

          o SMS_MFA

          o SOFTWARE_TOKEN_MFA

          o SELECT_MFA_TYPE

          o MFA_SETUP

          o PASSWORD_VERIFIER

          o CUSTOM_CHALLENGE

          o DEVICE_SRP_AUTH

          o DEVICE_PASSWORD_VERIFIER

          o ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH

          o NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED

       --challenge-responses (map)
          The challenge responses. These are inputs corresponding to the value
          of ChallengeName , for example:

          o SMS_MFA : SMS_MFA_CODE , USERNAME , SECRET_HASH (if app client  is
            configured with client secret).

          o PASSWORD_VERIFIER  : PASSWORD_CLAIM_SIGNATURE , PASSWORD_CLAIM_SE-
            CRET_BLOCK , TIMESTAMP , USERNAME , SECRET_HASH (if app client  is
            configured with client secret).

          NOTE:
              PASSWORD_VERIFIER requires DEVICE_KEY when signing in with a re-
              membered device.

          o ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH : PASSWORD ,  USERNAME  ,  SECRET_HASH  (if  app
            client is configured with client secret).

          o NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED  :  NEW_PASSWORD  ,  any  other required at-
            tributes, USERNAME , SECRET_HASH (if app client is configured with
            client secret).

          o MFA_SETUP  requires USERNAME , plus you must use the session value
            returned by VerifySoftwareToken in the Session parameter.

          The value of the USERNAME attribute must be the user's actual  user-
          name,  not  an  alias (such as an email address or phone number). To
          make this simpler, the AdminInitiateAuth response includes  the  ac-
          tual  username  value in the USERNAMEUSER_ID_FOR_SRP attribute. This
          happens even if you specified an alias in your call  to  AdminIniti-
          ateAuth .

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "IpAddress": "string",

            "ServerPath": "string",
            "HttpHeaders": [
              {
                "headerName": "string",
                "headerValue": "string"
              }
              ...

            "EncodedData": "string"
          }

       --client-metadata (map)
          A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide  as  input  for
          any custom workflows that this action triggers.

          You  create  custom  workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user
          pool triggers. When you use the AdminRespondToAuthChallenge API  ac-
          tion,  Amazon Cognito invokes any functions that are assigned to the
          following triggers: pre sign-up , custom message , post  authentica-
          tion , user migration , pre token generation , define auth challenge
          , create auth challenge , and verify auth challenge response .  When
          Amazon Cognito invokes any of these functions, it passes a JSON pay-
          load, which the function receives as input. This payload contains  a
          clientMetadata  attribute, which provides the data that you assigned
          to the ClientMetadata parameter in your  AdminRespondToAuthChallenge
          request.  In  your  function  code  in  Lambda,  you can process the
          clientMetadata value to enhance  your  workflow  for  your  specific
          needs.

          For  more  information,  see  Customizing  User  Pool Workflows with
          Lambda Triggers in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              When you use the ClientMetadata parameter, remember that  Amazon
              Cognito won't do the following:

              o Store the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to
                Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user  pool  to  support
                custom  workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't in-
                clude triggers, the ClientMetadata parameter  serves  no  pur-
                pose.

              o Validate the ClientMetadata value.

              o Encrypt  the ClientMetadata value. Don't use Amazon Cognito to
                provide sensitive information.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
