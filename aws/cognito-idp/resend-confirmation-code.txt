RESEND-CONFIRMATION-CODE()                          RESEND-CONFIRMATION-CODE()



NAME
       resend-confirmation-code -

DESCRIPTION
       Resends  the  confirmation (for confirmation of registration) to a spe-
       cific user in the user pool.

       NOTE:
          This action might generate an SMS text  message.  Starting  June  1,
          2021, U.S. telecom carriers require that you register an origination
          phone number before you can send SMS messages to U.S. phone numbers.
          If  you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a
          phone number with Amazon Pinpoint . Cognito will use the the  regis-
          tered  number  automatically. Otherwise, Cognito users that must re-
          ceive SMS messages might be unable to sign up,  activate  their  ac-
          counts, or sign in.

          If  you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any
          other Amazon Web Service, Amazon SNS might place your account in SMS
          sandbox. In * sandbox mode * , youll have limitations, such as send-
          ing messages to only verified phone numbers. After  testing  in  the
          sandbox  environment,  you  can move out of the SMS sandbox and into
          production. For more information, see SMS message settings for  Cog-
          nito User Pools in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-id (string)
          The ID of the client associated with the user pool.

       --secret-hash (string)
          A keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) calculated using the
          secret key of a user pool client and username plus the client ID  in
          the message.

       --user-context-data (structure)
          Contextual  data  such as the user's device fingerprint, IP address,
          or location used for evaluating the risk of an unexpected  event  by
          Amazon Cognito advanced security.

          EncodedData -> (string)
              Contextual  data  such  as the user's device fingerprint, IP ad-
              dress, or location used for evaluating the risk of an unexpected
              event by Amazon Cognito advanced security.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EncodedData=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "EncodedData": "string"
          }

       --username (string)
          The  user name of the user to whom you wish to resend a confirmation
          code.

       --analytics-metadata (structure)
          The Amazon Pinpoint analytics metadata for  collecting  metrics  for
          ResendConfirmationCode calls.

          AnalyticsEndpointId -> (string)
              The endpoint ID.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AnalyticsEndpointId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AnalyticsEndpointId": "string"
          }

       --client-metadata (map)
          A  map  of  custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for
          any custom workflows that this action triggers.

          You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda  functions  to  user
          pool  triggers.  When you use the ResendConfirmationCode API action,
          Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to  the  custom
          message  trigger.  When  Amazon  Cognito  invokes  this function, it
          passes a JSON payload, which the function receives  as  input.  This
          payload contains a clientMetadata attribute, which provides the data
          that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your ResendCon-
          firmationCode  request.  In  your  function  code in Lambda, you can
          process the clientMetadata value to enhance your workflow  for  your
          specific needs.

          For  more  information,  see  Customizing  User  Pool Workflows with
          Lambda Triggers in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              Take the following limitations into consideration when  you  use
              the ClientMetadata parameter:

              o Amazon  Cognito  does not store the ClientMetadata value. This
                data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to
                a  user  pool  to  support custom workflows. If your user pool
                configuration does not include  triggers,  the  ClientMetadata
                parameter serves no purpose.

              o Amazon Cognito does not validate the ClientMetadata value.

              o Amazon  Cognito does not encrypt the the ClientMetadata value,
                so don't use it to provide sensitive information.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
