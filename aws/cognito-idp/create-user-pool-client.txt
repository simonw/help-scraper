OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The  user  pool ID for the user pool where you want to create a user
          pool client.

       --client-name (string)
          The client name for the user pool client you would like to create.

       --generate-secret | --no-generate-secret (boolean)
          Boolean to specify whether you want to generate  a  secret  for  the
          user pool client being created.

       --refresh-token-validity (integer)
          The  time limit, in days, after which the refresh token is no longer
          valid and cannot be used.

       --access-token-validity (integer)
          The time limit, between 5 minutes and 1 day, after which the  access
          token  is  no  longer  valid  and cannot be used. This value will be
          overridden if you have entered a value in TokenValidityUnits.

       --id-token-validity (integer)
          The time limit, between 5 minutes and 1 day, after which the ID  to-
          ken  is no longer valid and cannot be used. This value will be over-
          ridden if you have entered a value in TokenValidityUnits.

       --token-validity-units (structure)
          The units in which the validity times are  represented  in.  Default
          for  RefreshToken  is days, and default for ID and access tokens are
          hours.

          AccessToken -> (string)
              A time unit in seconds, minutes, hours or days for the value  in
              AccessTokenValidity, defaults to hours.

          IdToken -> (string)
              A  time unit in seconds, minutes, hours or days for the value in
              IdTokenValidity, defaults to hours.

          RefreshToken -> (string)
              A time unit in seconds, minutes, hours or days for the value  in
              RefreshTokenValidity, defaults to days.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AccessToken=string,IdToken=string,RefreshToken=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AccessToken": "seconds"|"minutes"|"hours"|"days",
            "IdToken": "seconds"|"minutes"|"hours"|"days",
            "RefreshToken": "seconds"|"minutes"|"hours"|"days"
          }

       --read-attributes (list)
          The read attributes.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --write-attributes (list)
          The user pool attributes that the app client can write to.

          If  your  app  client  allows  users  to sign in through an identity
          provider, this array must include all attributes that are mapped  to
          identity  provider  attributes.  Amazon  Cognito  updates mapped at-
          tributes when users sign in to your application through an  identity
          provider.  If  your app client lacks write access to a mapped attri-
          bute, Amazon Cognito throws an error when it attempts to update  the
          attribute.  For  more  information, see Specifying Identity Provider
          Attribute Mappings for Your User Pool .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --explicit-auth-flows (list)
          The authentication  flows  that  are  supported  by  the  user  pool
          clients.  Flow names without the ALLOW_ prefix are deprecated in fa-
          vor of new names with the ALLOW_ prefix. Note that values  with  AL-
          LOW_ prefix cannot be used along with values without ALLOW_ prefix.

          Valid values include:

          o ALLOW_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH  : Enable admin based user password
            authentication flow ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH .  This  setting  re-
            places  the  ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH  setting.  With this authentication
            flow, Cognito receives the password in the request instead of  us-
            ing  the  SRP (Secure Remote Password protocol) protocol to verify
            passwords.

          o ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH : Enable Lambda trigger based authentication.

          o ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH : Enable user password-based  authentica-
            tion.  In  this flow, Cognito receives the password in the request
            instead of using the SRP protocol to verify passwords.

          o ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH : Enable SRP based authentication.

          o ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH : Enable authflow to refresh tokens.

          App callback URLs such as myapp://example are also supported.

       --allowed-o-auth-flows (list)
          The allowed OAuth flows.

          Set  to code to initiate a code grant flow, which provides an autho-
          rization code as the response. This code can be exchanged for access
          tokens with the token endpoint.

          Set to implicit to specify that the client should get the access to-
          ken (and, optionally, ID token, based on scopes) directly.

          Set to client_credentials to specify that the client should get  the
          access  token  (and, optionally, ID token, based on scopes) from the
          token endpoint using a combination of client and client_secret.

          (string)

       Syntax:

       lowed-o-auth-flows-user-pool-client (boolean)
          Set to true if the client is allowed to follow  the  OAuth  protocol
          when interacting with Cognito user pools.

       --analytics-configuration (structure)
          The  Amazon  Pinpoint analytics configuration for collecting metrics
          for this user pool.

          NOTE:
              In regions where Pinpoint is not available, Cognito  User  Pools
              only  supports  sending  events  to  Amazon Pinpoint projects in
              us-east-1. In regions where Pinpoint is available, Cognito  User
              Pools  will  support  sending events to Amazon Pinpoint projects
              within that same region.

          ApplicationId -> (string)
              The application ID for an Amazon Pinpoint application.

          ApplicationArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an  Amazon  Pinpoint  project.
              You can use the Amazon Pinpoint project for Pinpoint integration
              with the chosen  User  Pool  Client.  Amazon  Cognito  publishes
              events to the pinpoint project declared by the app ARN.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of an IAM role that authorizes Amazon Cognito to publish
              events to Amazon Pinpoint analytics.

          ExternalId -> (string)
              The external ID.

          UserDataShared -> (boolean)
              If UserDataShared is true , Amazon  Cognito  will  include  user
              data in the events it publishes to Amazon Pinpoint analytics.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ApplicationId=string,ApplicationArn=string,RoleArn=string,ExternalId=string,UserDataShared=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ApplicationId": "string",
            "ApplicationArn": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string",
            "ExternalId": "string",
            "UserDataShared": true|false
          }

       --prevent-user-existence-errors (string)
          Use  this  setting to choose which errors and responses are returned
          by Cognito APIs during  authentication,  account  confirmation,  and
          password  recovery  when  the  user does not exist in the user pool.
          When set to ENABLED and the user does not exist, authentication  re-
          turns an error indicating either the username or password was incor-
          rect, and account confirmation and password recovery  return  a  re-
          sponse  indicating  a code was sent to a simulated destination. When
          set to LEGACY , those APIs will return a  UserNotFoundException  ex-
          ception if the user does not exist in the user pool.

          Valid values include:

          o ENABLED - This prevents user existence-related errors.

          o LEGACY  -  This  represents the old behavior of Cognito where user
            existence related errors are not prevented.

          NOTE:
              After February 15th 2020, the value  of  PreventUserExistenceEr-
              rors will default to ENABLED for newly created user pool clients
              if no value is provided.

          Possible values:

          o LEGACY

          o ENABLED

       --enable-token-revocation | --no-enable-token-revocation (boolean)
          Enables or disables token revocation. For more information about re-
          voking tokens, see RevokeToken .

          If  you  don't include this parameter, token revocation is automati-
          cally enabled for the new user pool client.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              o Be an absolute URI.

              o Be registered with the authorization server.

              o Not include a fragment component.

              See OAuth 2.0 - Redirection Endpoint .

              Amazon   Cognito   requires   HTTPS   over   HTTP   except   for
              http://localhost for testing purposes only.

              App callback URLs such as myapp://example are also supported.

          AllowedOAuthFlows -> (list)
              The allowed OAuth flows.

              Set to code to initiate a code grant flow, which provides an au-
              thorization code as the response. This code can be exchanged for
              access tokens with the token endpoint.

              Set to implicit to specify that the client should get the access
              token (and, optionally, ID token, based on scopes) directly.

              Set  to client_credentials to specify that the client should get
              the access token (and, optionally, ID token,  based  on  scopes)
              from  the  token  endpoint  using  a  combination  of client and
              client_secret.

              (string)

          AllowedOAuthScopes -> (list)
              The allowed OAuth scopes. Possible values provided by OAuth are:
              phone  , email , openid , and profile . Possible values provided
              by Amazon Web Services are: aws.cognito.signin.user.admin . Cus-
              tom scopes created in Resource Servers are also supported.

              (string)

          AllowedOAuthFlowsUserPoolClient -> (boolean)
              Set  to true if the client is allowed to follow the OAuth proto-
              col when interacting with Cognito user pools.

          AnalyticsConfiguration -> (structure)
              The Amazon Pinpoint analytics configuration for  the  user  pool
              client.

              NOTE:
                 Cognito  User  Pools  only  supports sending events to Amazon
                 Pinpoint projects in the US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1  Re-
                 gion,  regardless  of  the  region in which the user pool re-
                 sides.

              ApplicationId -> (string)
                 The application ID for an Amazon Pinpoint application.

              ApplicationArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon Pinpoint project.
                 You can use the Amazon Pinpoint project for Pinpoint integra-
                 tion with the chosen User Pool Client.  Amazon  Cognito  pub-
                 lishes  events  to  the  pinpoint project declared by the app
                 ARN.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of an IAM role that authorizes Amazon Cognito to pub-
                 lish events to Amazon Pinpoint analytics.

              ExternalId -> (string)
                 The external ID.

              UserDataShared -> (boolean)
                 If  UserDataShared is true , Amazon Cognito will include user
                 data in the events it publishes to Amazon Pinpoint analytics.

          PreventUserExistenceErrors -> (string)
              Use this setting to choose which errors and  responses  are  re-
              turned  by Cognito APIs during authentication, account confirma-
              tion, and password recovery when the user does not exist in  the
              user  pool. When set to ENABLED and the user does not exist, au-
              thentication returns an error indicating either the username  or
              password  was  incorrect,  and account confirmation and password
              recovery return a response indicating a code was sent to a simu-
              lated destination. When set to LEGACY , those APIs will return a
              UserNotFoundException exception if the user does  not  exist  in
              the user pool.

              Valid values include:

              o ENABLED - This prevents user existence-related errors.

              o LEGACY  -  This  represents  the old behavior of Cognito where
                user existence related errors are not prevented.

              NOTE:
                 After February  15th  2020,  the  value  of  PreventUserExis-
                 tenceErrors  will  default  to ENABLED for newly created user
                 pool clients if no value is provided.

          EnableTokenRevocation -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether token revocation is enabled for the user  pool
              client. When you create a new user pool client, token revocation
              is enabled by default. For more information about  revoking  to-
              kens, see RevokeToken .
