CREATE-USER-POOL-CLIENT()                            CREATE-USER-POOL-CLIENT()



NAME
       create-user-pool-client -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates the user pool client.

       When  you  create a new user pool client, token revocation is automati-
       cally activated.  For  more  information  about  revoking  tokens,  see
       RevokeToken .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The  user  pool ID for the user pool where you want to create a user
          pool client.

       --client-name (string)
          The client name for the user pool client you would like to create.

       --generate-secret | --no-generate-secret (boolean)
          Boolean to specify whether you want to generate  a  secret  for  the
          user pool client being created.

       --refresh-token-validity (integer)
          The  time limit, in days, after which the refresh token is no longer
          valid and can't be used.

       --access-token-validity (integer)
          The time limit, between 5 minutes and 1 day, after which the  access
          token is no longer valid and can't be used. If you supply a TokenVa-
          lidityUnits value, you will override the default time unit.

       --id-token-validity (integer)
          The time limit, between 5 minutes and 1 day, after which the  access
          token is no longer valid and can't be used. If you supply a TokenVa-
          lidityUnits value, you will override the default time unit.

       --token-validity-units (structure)
          The units in which the validity times are represented.  Default  for
          RefreshToken  is  days,  and  default  for  ID and access tokens are
          hours.

          AccessToken -> (string)
              A time unit in seconds, minutes, hours, or days for the value in
              AccessTokenValidity, defaulting to hours.

          IdToken -> (string)
              A time unit in seconds, minutes, hours, or days for the value in
              IdTokenValidity, defaulting to hours.

          RefreshToken -> (string)
              A time unit in seconds, minutes, hours, or days for the value in
              RefreshTokenValidity, defaulting to days.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AccessToken=string,IdToken=string,RefreshToken=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AccessToken": "seconds"|"minutes"|"hours"|"days",
            "IdToken": "seconds"|"minutes"|"hours"|"days",
            "RefreshToken": "seconds"|"minutes"|"hours"|"days"
          }

       --read-attributes (list)
          The read attributes.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --write-attributes (list)
          The user pool attributes that the app client can write to.

          If  your  app  client  allows  users  to sign in through an identity
          provider, this array must include all attributes that are mapped  to
          identity  provider  attributes.  Amazon  Cognito  updates mapped at-
          tributes when users sign in to your application through an  identity
          provider.  If  your app client lacks write access to a mapped attri-
          bute, Amazon Cognito throws an error when it tries to update the at-
          tribute.  For more information, see Specifying Identity Provider At-
          tribute Mappings for Your User Pool .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --explicit-auth-flows (list)
          The authentication  flows  that  are  supported  by  the  user  pool
          clients.  Flow  names  without  the ALLOW_ prefix are no longer sup-
          ported, in favor of new names with the ALLOW_ prefix. Note that val-
          ues  with ALLOW_ prefix must be used only along with the ALLOW_ pre-
          fix.

          Valid values include:

          o ALLOW_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH : Enable admin based user  password
            authentication  flow  ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH  . This setting re-
            places the ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH  setting.  With  this  authentication
            flow,  Amazon Cognito receives the password in the request instead
            of using the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol to verify pass-
            words.

          o ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH : Enable Lambda trigger based authentication.

          o ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH  : Enable user password-based authentica-
            tion. In this flow, Amazon Cognito receives the  password  in  the
            request instead of using the SRP protocol to verify passwords.

          o ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH : Enable SRP-based authentication.

          o ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH : Enable authflow to refresh tokens.

       --allowed-o-auth-flows (list)
          The allowed OAuth flows.

          Set to code to initiate a code grant flow, which provides an  autho-
          rization code as the response. This code can be exchanged for access
          tokens with the token endpoint.

          Set to implicit to specify that the client should get the access to-
          ken (and, optionally, ID token, based on scopes) directly.

          Set  to client_credentials to specify that the client should get the
          access token (and, optionally, ID token, based on scopes)  from  the
          token endpoint using a combination of client and client_secret.

       lowed-o-auth-flows-user-pool-client (boolean)
          Set  to  true  if the client is allowed to follow the OAuth protocol
          when interacting with Amazon Cognito user pools.

       --analytics-configuration (structure)
          The Amazon Pinpoint analytics configuration for  collecting  metrics
          for this user pool.

          NOTE:
              In Amazon Web Services Regions where isn't available, User Pools
              only supports sending events to Amazon Pinpoint projects in Ama-
              zon  Web  Services  Region us-east-1. In Regions where is avail-
              able, User Pools will support sending events to Amazon  Pinpoint
              projects within that same Region.

          ApplicationId -> (string)
              The application ID for an Amazon Pinpoint application.

          ApplicationArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of an Amazon Pinpoint project.
              You can use the Amazon Pinpoint project for integration with the
              chosen  User Pool Client. Amazon Cognito publishes events to the
              Amazon Pinpointproject declared by the app ARN.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of an Identity and Access Management  role  that  autho-
              rizes  Amazon  Cognito to publish events to Amazon Pinpoint ana-
              lytics.

          ExternalId -> (string)
              The external ID.

          UserDataShared -> (boolean)
              If UserDataShared is true , Amazon  Cognito  will  include  user
              data in the events it publishes to Amazon Pinpoint analytics.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ApplicationId=string,ApplicationArn=string,RoleArn=string,ExternalId=string,UserDataShared=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ApplicationId": "string",
            "ApplicationArn": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string",
            "ExternalId": "string",
            "UserDataShared": true|false
          }

       --prevent-user-existence-errors (string)
          Errors  and  responses  that  you want Amazon Cognito APIs to return
          during authentication, account confirmation, and  password  recovery
          when  the  user  doesn't exist in the user pool. When set to ENABLED
          and the user doesn't exist, authentication returns an error indicat-
          ing either the username or password was incorrect. Account confirma-
          tion and password recovery return a response indicating a  code  was
          sent to a simulated destination. When set to LEGACY , those APIs re-
          turn a UserNotFoundException exception if the user doesn't exist  in
          the user pool.

          Valid values include:

          o ENABLED - This prevents user existence-related errors.

          o LEGACY  -  This  represents  the  early behavior of Amazon Cognito
            where user existence related errors aren't prevented.

          Possible values:

          o LEGACY

          o ENABLED

       --enable-token-revocation | --no-enable-token-revocation (boolean)
          Activates or deactivates  token  revocation.  For  more  information
          about revoking tokens, see RevokeToken .

          If  you  don't include this parameter, token revocation is automati-
          cally activated for the new user pool client.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       This  example  creates  a new user pool client with two explicit autho-
       rization flows: USER_PASSWORD_AUTH and ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH.

       Command:

          aws cognito-idp create-user-pool-client --user-pool-id us-west-2_aaaaaaaaa  --client-name MyNewClient --no-generate-secret --explicit-auth-flows "USER_PASSWORD_AUTH" "ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH"

              The  authentication  flows  that  are supported by the user pool
              clients. Flow names without the ALLOW_ prefix are no longer sup-
              ported  in  favor of new names with the ALLOW_ prefix. Note that
              values with ALLOW_ prefix must be used only  along  with  values

                word authentication flow ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH . This  set-
                ting replaces the ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH setting. With this authen-
                tication flow, Amazon Cognito receives the password in the re-
                quest instead of using the Secure Remote Password (SRP) proto-
                col to verify passwords.

              o ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH : Enable Lambda  trigger  based  authentica-
                tion.

              o ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH  : Enable user password-based authen-
                tication. In this flow, Amazon Cognito receives  the  password
                in  the  request  instead  of using the SRP protocol to verify
                passwords.

              o ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH : Enable SRP-based authentication.

              Amazon   Cognito   requires   HTTPS   over   HTTP   except   for
              http://localhost for testing purposes only.

              App callback URLs such as myapp://example are also supported.

          AllowedOAuthFlows -> (list)
              The allowed OAuth flows.

              Set to code to initiate a code grant flow, which provides an au-
              thorization code as the response. This code can be exchanged for
              access tokens with the token endpoint.

              Set to implicit to specify that the client should get the access
              token (and, optionally, ID token, based on scopes) directly.

              Set  to client_credentials to specify that the client should get
              the access token (and, optionally, ID token,  based  on  scopes)
              from  the  token  endpoint  using  a  combination  of client and
              client_secret.

              (string)

          AllowedOAuthScopes -> (list)
              The allowed OAuth scopes. Possible values provided by OAuth are:
              phone  , email , openid , and profile . Possible values provided
              by Amazon Web Services are: aws.cognito.signin.user.admin . Cus-
              tom scopes created in Resource Servers are also supported.

              (string)

          AllowedOAuthFlowsUserPoolClient -> (boolean)
              Set  to true if the client is allowed to follow the OAuth proto-
              col when interacting with Amazon Cognito user pools.

          AnalyticsConfiguration -> (structure)
              The Amazon Pinpoint analytics configuration for  the  user  pool
              client.

              NOTE:
                 Amazon  Cognito  User  Pools  only supports sending events to
                 Amazon  Pinpoint  projects  in  the  US  East  (N.  Virginia)
                 us-east-1  Region, regardless of the Region in which the user
                 pool resides.

              ApplicationId -> (string)
                 The application ID for an Amazon Pinpoint application.

              ApplicationArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon Pinpoint project.
                 You  can use the Amazon Pinpoint project for integration with
                 the chosen User Pool Client. Amazon Cognito publishes  events
                 to the Amazon Pinpointproject declared by the app ARN.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of an Identity and Access Management role that autho-
                 rizes Amazon Cognito to publish events to Amazon Pinpoint an-
                 alytics.

              ExternalId -> (string)
                 The external ID.

              UserDataShared -> (boolean)
                 If  UserDataShared is true , Amazon Cognito will include user
                 data in the events it publishes to Amazon Pinpoint analytics.

          PreventUserExistenceErrors -> (string)
              Errors and responses that you want Amazon Cognito APIs to return
              during authentication, account confirmation, and password recov-
              ery when the user doesn't exist in the user pool.  When  set  to
              ENABLED  and  the  user doesn't exist, authentication returns an
              error indicating either the username or password was  incorrect.
              Account confirmation and password recovery return a response in-
              dicating a code was sent to a simulated destination. When set to
              LEGACY  , those APIs return a UserNotFoundException exception if
              the user doesn't exist in the user pool.

              Valid values include:

              o ENABLED - This prevents user existence-related errors.

              o LEGACY - This represents the old  behavior  of  Cognito  where
                user existence related errors aren't prevented.

          EnableTokenRevocation -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether  token  revocation  is activated for the user
              pool client. When you create a new user pool client, token revo-
              cation  is  activated by default. For more information about re-
              voking tokens, see RevokeToken .
