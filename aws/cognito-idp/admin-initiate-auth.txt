ADMIN-INITIATE-AUTH()                                    ADMIN-INITIATE-AUTH()



NAME
       admin-initiate-auth -

DESCRIPTION
       Initiates the authentication flow, as an administrator.

       NOTE:
          This  action  might  generate  an SMS text message. Starting June 1,
          2021, US telecom carriers require you  to  register  an  origination
          phone number before you can send SMS messages to U.S. phone numbers.
          If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register  a
          phone number with Amazon Pinpoint . Amazon Cognito will use the reg-
          istered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito  users  that
          must receive SMS messages might be unable to sign up, activate their
          accounts, or sign in.

          If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or  any
          other  Amazon  Web Service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might
          place your account in SMS sandbox. In * sandbox mode *  ,  you  will
          have  limitations,  such  as sending messages only to verified phone
          numbers. After testing in the sandbox environment, you can move  out
          of  the  SMS  sandbox and into production. For more information, see
          SMS message settings for Amazon Cognito User  Pools  in  the  Amazon
          Cognito Developer Guide .

       Calling this action requires developer credentials.

SYNOPSIS
            admin-initiate-auth
          --user-pool-id <value>
          --client-id <value>
          --auth-flow <value>
          [--auth-parameters <value>]
          [--client-metadata <value>]
          [--analytics-metadata <value>]
          [--context-data <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Cognito user pool.

       --client-id (string)
          The app client ID.

       --auth-flow (string)
          The  authentication  flow  for this call to run. The API action will
          depend on this value. For example:

          o REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH will take in a valid refresh token  and  return
            new tokens.

          o USER_SRP_AUTH  will  take in USERNAME and SRP_A and return the Se-
            cure Remote Password (SRP) protocol variables to be used for  next
            challenge execution.

          o ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH  will  take  in USERNAME and PASSWORD and
            return the next challenge or tokens.

          Valid values include:

          o USER_SRP_AUTH : Authentication flow for the Secure Remote Password
            (SRP) protocol.

          o REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH  /REFRESH_TOKEN  :  Authentication flow for re-
            freshing the access token and ID token by supplying  a  valid  re-
            fresh token.

          o CUSTOM_AUTH : Custom authentication flow.

          o ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH  :  Non-SRP authentication flow; you can pass in
            the USERNAME and PASSWORD directly if  the  flow  is  enabled  for
            calling the app client.

          o ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH  :  Admin-based user password authentica-
            tion. This replaces the ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH authentication flow.  In
            this flow, Amazon Cognito receives the password in the request in-
            stead of using the SRP process to verify passwords.

          Possible values:

          o USER_SRP_AUTH

          o REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH

          o REFRESH_TOKEN

          o CUSTOM_AUTH

          o ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH

          o USER_PASSWORD_AUTH

          o ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH

       --auth-parameters (map)
          The authentication parameters. These are inputs corresponding to the
          AuthFlow  that  you're  invoking.  The required values depend on the
          value of AuthFlow :

          o For USER_SRP_AUTH : USERNAME  (required),  SRP_A  (required),  SE-
            CRET_HASH  (required if the app client is configured with a client
            secret), DEVICE_KEY .

          o For REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH/REFRESH_TOKEN :  REFRESH_TOKEN  (required),
            SECRET_HASH  (required  if  the  app  client  is configured with a
            client secret), DEVICE_KEY .

          o For ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH : USERNAME (required), SECRET_HASH  (if  app
            client is configured with client secret), PASSWORD (required), DE-
            VICE_KEY .

          o For CUSTOM_AUTH : USERNAME (required), SECRET_HASH (if app  client
            is  configured  with client secret), DEVICE_KEY . To start the au-
            thentication flow with password verification,  include  Challenge-
            Name: SRP_A and SRP_A: (The SRP_A Value) .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --client-metadata (map)
          A  map  of  custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for
          certain custom workflows that this action triggers.

          You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda  functions  to  user
          pool triggers. When you use the AdminInitiateAuth API action, Amazon
          Cognito invokes the Lambda functions that are specified for  various
          triggers.  The  ClientMetadata value is passed as input to the func-
          tions for only the following triggers:

          o Pre signup

          o Pre authentication

          o User migration

          When Amazon Cognito invokes the functions  for  these  triggers,  it
          passes  a  JSON  payload, which the function receives as input. This
          payload contains a validationData attribute, which provides the data
          that  you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your AdminIni-
          tiateAuth request. In your function code in Lambda, you can  process
          the  validationData value to enhance your workflow for your specific
          needs.

          When you use the AdminInitiateAuth API action, Amazon  Cognito  also
          invokes  the  functions  for  the following triggers, but it doesn't
          provide the ClientMetadata value as input:

          o Post authentication

          o Custom message

          o Pre token generation

          o Create auth challenge

          o Define auth challenge

          o Verify auth challenge

          For more information,  see  Customizing  User  Pool  Workflows  with
          Lambda Triggers in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              When  you use the ClientMetadata parameter, remember that Amazon
              Cognito won't do the following:

              o Store the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to
                Lambda  triggers  that  are assigned to a user pool to support
                custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't  in-
                clude  triggers,  the  ClientMetadata parameter serves no pur-
                pose.

              o Validate the ClientMetadata value.

              o Encrypt the ClientMetadata value. Don't use Amazon Cognito  to
                provide sensitive information.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To initiate authorization

       This example initiates authorization using the  ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH  flow
       for username jane@example.com

       The  client  must have sign-in API for server-based authentication (AD-
       MIN_NO_SRP_AUTH) enabled.

       Use  the  session   information   in   the   return   value   to   call
       admin-respond-to-auth-challenge.

       Command:

          aws cognito-idp admin-initiate-auth --user-pool-id us-west-2_aaaaaaaaa --client-id 3n4b5urk1ft4fl3mg5e62d9ado --auth-flow ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH --auth-parameters USERNAME=jane@example.com,PASSWORD=password

       Output:

          {
            "ChallengeName": "NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED",
            "Session": "SESSION",
            "ChallengeParameters": {
                "USER_ID_FOR_SRP": "84514837-dcbc-4af1-abff-f3c109334894",
                "requiredAttributes": "[]",
                "userAttributes": "{\"email_verified\":\"true\",\"phone_number_verified\":\"true\",\"phone_number\":\"+01xxx5550100\",\"email\":\"jane@example.com\"}"
            }
          }

OUTPUT
       ChallengeName -> (string)
          The  name of the challenge that you're responding to with this call.
          This is returned in the AdminInitiateAuth response if you must  pass
          another challenge.

          o MFA_SETUP  : If MFA is required, users who don't have at least one
            of the MFA methods set up are presented with  an  MFA_SETUP  chal-
            lenge.  The  user must set up at least one MFA type to continue to
            authenticate.

          o SELECT_MFA_TYPE : Selects the MFA  type.  Valid  MFA  options  are
            SMS_MFA  for  text  SMS MFA, and SOFTWARE_TOKEN_MFA for time-based
            one-time password (TOTP) software token MFA.

          o SMS_MFA : Next challenge is to supply an SMS_MFA_CODE ,  delivered
            via SMS.

          o PASSWORD_VERIFIER   :   Next   challenge   is   to   supply  PASS-
            WORD_CLAIM_SIGNATURE , PASSWORD_CLAIM_SECRET_BLOCK , and TIMESTAMP
            after the client-side SRP calculations.

          o CUSTOM_CHALLENGE  : This is returned if your custom authentication
            flow determines that the user should pass another challenge before
            tokens are issued.

          o DEVICE_SRP_AUTH  :  If  device tracking was activated in your user
            pool and the previous challenges were passed,  this  challenge  is
            returned so that Amazon Cognito can start tracking this device.

          o DEVICE_PASSWORD_VERIFIER  : Similar to PASSWORD_VERIFIER , but for
            devices only.

          o ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH : This is returned if you must authenticate with
            USERNAME  and  PASSWORD directly. An app client must be enabled to
            use this flow.

          o NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED : For users who are required to change their
            passwords  after  successful first login. This challenge should be
            passed with NEW_PASSWORD and any other required attributes.

          o MFA_SETUP : For users who are required to set up an MFA factor be-
            fore  they  can sign in. The MFA types activated for the user pool
            will be listed in the challenge  parameters  MFA_CAN_SETUP  value.
            To  set  up software token MFA, use the session returned here from
            InitiateAuth as an input to AssociateSoftwareToken , and  use  the
            session  returned  by  VerifySoftwareToken as an input to Respond-
            ToAuthChallenge with challenge name MFA_SETUP to complete sign-in.
            To  set  up SMS MFA, users will need help from an administrator to
            add a phone number to their account  and  then  call  InitiateAuth
            again to restart sign-in.

       Session -> (string)
          The  session  that  should be passed both ways in challenge-response
          calls to the  service.  If  AdminInitiateAuth  or  AdminRespondToAu-
          thChallenge  API  call  determines that the caller must pass another
          challenge, they return a session with  other  challenge  parameters.
          This session should be passed as it is to the next AdminRespondToAu-
          thChallenge API call.

       ChallengeParameters -> (map)
          The challenge parameters. These are returned to you in the AdminIni-
          tiateAuth response if you must pass another challenge. The responses
          in this parameter should be used to compute inputs to the next  call
          (AdminRespondToAuthChallenge ).

          All challenges require USERNAME and SECRET_HASH (if applicable).

          The  value  of  the  USER_ID_FOR_SRP  attribute is the user's actual
          username, not an alias (such as email address or phone number), even
          if  you  specified an alias in your call to AdminInitiateAuth . This
          happens because, in the AdminRespondToAuthChallenge API ChallengeRe-
          sponses , the USERNAME attribute can't be an alias.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       AuthenticationResult -> (structure)
          The  result of the authentication response. This is only returned if
          the caller doesn't need to pass another  challenge.  If  the  caller
          does  need to pass another challenge before it gets tokens, Challen-
          geName , ChallengeParameters , and Session are returned.

          AccessToken -> (string)
              The access token.

          ExpiresIn -> (integer)
              The expiration period of the authentication result in seconds.

          TokenType -> (string)
              The token type.

          RefreshToken -> (string)
              The refresh token.

          IdToken -> (string)
              The ID token.

          NewDeviceMetadata -> (structure)
              The new device metadata from an authentication result.

              DeviceKey -> (string)
                 The device key.

              DeviceGroupKey -> (string)
                 The device group key.
