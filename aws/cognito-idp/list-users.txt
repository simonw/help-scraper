LIST-USERS()                                                      LIST-USERS()



NAME
       list-users -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the users in the Amazon Cognito user pool.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-users  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Users

SYNOPSIS
            list-users
          --user-pool-id <value>
          [--attributes-to-get <value>]
          [--filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for the user pool on which  the  search  should  be
          performed.

       --attributes-to-get (list)
          An  array of strings, where each string is the name of a user attri-
          bute to be returned for each user in the search results. If the  ar-
          ray is null, all attributes are returned.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filter (string)
          A  filter string of the form "AttributeName  Filter-Type "Attribute-
          Value "". Quotation marks within the filter string must  be  escaped
          using  the  backslash  ()  character.  For  example,  "family_name =
          "Reddy"".

          o AttributeName : The name of the attribute to search for.  You  can
            only search for one attribute at a time.

          o Filter-Type  : For an exact match, use =, for example, "given_name
            = "Jon"". For a prefix ("starts with") match, use ^=, for example,
            "given_name ^= "Jon"".

          o AttributeValue : The attribute value that must be matched for each
            user.

          If the filter string is empty, ListUsers returns all  users  in  the
          user pool.

          You can only search for the following standard attributes:

          o username (case-sensitive)

          o email

          o phone_number

          o name

          o given_name

          o family_name

          o preferred_username

          o cognito:user_status  (called Status in the Console) (case-insensi-
            tive)

          o status (called **Enabled** in the Console) (case-sensitive)

          o sub

          Custom attributes aren't searchable.

          NOTE:
              You  can  also  list  users  with  a  client-side  filter.   The
              server-side  filter  matches  no more than one attribute. For an
              advanced search, use a client-side filter with the  --query  pa-
              rameter  of  the  list-users  action  in the CLI. When you use a
              client-side filter, ListUsers returns a paginated list  of  zero
              or more users. You can receive multiple pages in a row with zero
              results. Repeat the query with each pagination token that is re-
              turned until you receive a null pagination token value, and then
              review the combined result.

              For more information about server-side and  client-side  filter-
              ing,  see FilteringCLI output in the Command Line Interface User
              Guide .

          For more information, see Searching for Users  Using  the  ListUsers
          API  and  Examples  of Using the ListUsers API in the Amazon Cognito
          Developer Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
