NAME
       get-user-attribute-verification-code -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the  user attribute verification code for the specified attribute
       name.

       NOTE:
          This action might generate an SMS text  message.  Starting  June  1,
          2021,  US  telecom  carriers  require you to register an origination
          phone number before you can send SMS messages to U.S. phone numbers.
          If  you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a
          phone number with Amazon Pinpoint . Amazon Cognito will use the reg-
          istered  number  automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users that
          must receive SMS messages might be unable to sign up, activate their
          accounts, or sign in.

          If  you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any
          other Amazon Web Service, Amazon Simple Notification  Service  might
          place  your  account  in SMS sandbox. In * sandbox mode * , you will
          have limitations, such as sending messages only  to  verified  phone
          numbers.  After testing in the sandbox environment, you can move out
          of the SMS sandbox and into production. For  more  information,  see
          SMS  message  settings  for  Amazon Cognito User Pools in the Amazon
          Cognito Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            get-user-attribute-verification-code
          --access-token <value>
          --attribute-name <value>
          [--client-metadata <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --access-token (string)
          The access token returned by the server response to get the user at-
          tribute verification code.

       --attribute-name (string)
          The  attribute  name returned by the server response to get the user
          attribute verification code.

       --client-metadata (map)
          A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide  as  input  for
          any custom workflows that this action triggers.

          You  create  custom  workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user
          pool triggers. When you use the GetUserAttributeVerificationCode API
          action,  Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to the
          custom message trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes  this  function,
          it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This
          payload contains a clientMetadata attribute, which provides the data
          that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your GetUserAt-
          tributeVerificationCode request. In your function  code  in  Lambda,
          you  can  process  the clientMetadata value to enhance your workflow
          for your specific needs.

          For more information,  see  Customizing  User  Pool  Workflows  with
          Lambda Triggers in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              When  you use the ClientMetadata parameter, remember that Amazon
              Cognito won't do the following:

              o Store the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to
                Lambda  triggers  that  are assigned to a user pool to support
                custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't  in-
                clude  triggers,  the  ClientMetadata parameter serves no pur-
                pose.

              o Validate the ClientMetadata value.

              o Encrypt the ClientMetadata value. Don't use Amazon Cognito  to
                provide sensitive information.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
