CREATE-USER-POOL()                                          CREATE-USER-POOL()



NAME
       create-user-pool -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new Amazon Cognito user pool and sets the password policy for
       the pool.

       NOTE:
          This action might generate an SMS text  message.  Starting  June  1,
          2021, U.S. telecom carriers require that you register an origination
          phone number before you can send SMS messages to U.S. phone numbers.
          If  you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a
          phone number with Amazon Pinpoint . Cognito will use the the  regis-
          tered  number  automatically. Otherwise, Cognito users that must re-
          ceive SMS messages might be unable to sign up,  activate  their  ac-
          counts, or sign in.

          If  you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any
          other Amazon Web Service, Amazon SNS might place your account in SMS
          sandbox. In * sandbox mode * , youll have limitations, such as send-
          ing messages to only verified phone numbers. After  testing  in  the
          sandbox  environment,  you  can move out of the SMS sandbox and into
          production. For more information, see SMS message settings for  Cog-
          nito User Pools in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --pool-name (string)
          A string used to name the user pool.

       --policies (structure)
          The policies associated with the new user pool.

          PasswordPolicy -> (structure)
              The password policy.

              MinimumLength -> (integer)
                 The  minimum length of the password policy that you have set.
                 Cannot be less than 6.

              RequireUppercase -> (boolean)
                 In the password policy that you have set, refers  to  whether
                 you  have required users to use at least one uppercase letter
                 in their password.

              RequireLowercase -> (boolean)
                 In the password policy that you have set, refers  to  whether
                 you  have required users to use at least one lowercase letter
                 in their password.

              RequireNumbers -> (boolean)
                 In the password policy that you have set, refers  to  whether
                 you  have  required users to use at least one number in their
                 password.

              RequireSymbols -> (boolean)
                 In the password policy that you have set, refers  to  whether
                 you  have  required users to use at least one symbol in their
                 password.

              TemporaryPasswordValidityDays -> (integer)
                 In the password policy you have set, refers to the number  of
                 days  a  temporary  password  is  valid. If the user does not
                 sign-in during this time, their password will need to be  re-
                 set by an administrator.

                 NOTE:
                     When  you  set  TemporaryPasswordValidityDays  for a user
                     pool, you will no longer be able to  set  the  deprecated
                     UnusedAccountValidityDays value for that user pool.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          PasswordPolicy={MinimumLength=integer,RequireUppercase=boolean,RequireLowercase=boolean,RequireNumbers=boolean,RequireSymbols=boolean,TemporaryPasswordValidityDays=integer}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "PasswordPolicy": {

          }

       --lambda-config (structure)
          The Lambda trigger configuration information for the new user pool.

          NOTE:
              In a push model, event sources (such as Amazon S3 and custom ap-
              plications) need permission to invoke a function.  So  you  will
              need  to  make  an  extra call to add permission for these event
              sources to invoke your Lambda function.

              For more information on using the Lambda API to add  permission,

              ways,  depending  on  the  value  that  you  specify   for   the
              EmailSendingAccount parameter:

              o If  you specify COGNITO_DEFAULT , Amazon Cognito uses this ad-
                dress as the custom FROM address when it emails your users  by
                using its built-in email account.

              o If  you  specify  DEVELOPER , Amazon Cognito emails your users
                with this address by calling Amazon SES on your behalf.

          ReplyToEmailAddress -> (string)
              The destination to which the receiver of the email should  reply
              to.

          EmailSendingAccount -> (string)
              Specifies  whether Amazon Cognito emails your users by using its
              built-in email functionality or your Amazon SES email configura-
              tion. Specify one of the following values:
                 COGNITO_DEFAULT

              When  Amazon  Cognito  emails  your  users, it uses its built-in
              email functionality. When you use  the  default  option,  Amazon
              Cognito allows only a limited number of emails each day for your
              user pool. For  typical  production  environments,  the  default
              email  limit is below the required delivery volume. To achieve a
              higher delivery volume, specify DEVELOPER to use your Amazon SES
              email configuration.

              To  look up the email delivery limit for the default option, see
              Limits in Amazon Cognito in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

              The default FROM address is  no-reply@verificationemail.com.  To
              customize  the  FROM  address,  provide the ARN of an Amazon SES
              verified email address for the SourceArn parameter.

              If EmailSendingAccount is COGNITO_DEFAULT, the following parame-
              ters aren't allowed:

              o EmailVerificationMessage

              o EmailVerificationSubject

              o InviteMessageTemplate.EmailMessage

              o InviteMessageTemplate.EmailSubject

              o VerificationMessageTemplate.EmailMessage

              o VerificationMessageTemplate.EmailMessageByLink

              o VerificationMessageTemplate.EmailSubject,

              o VerificationMessageTemplate.EmailSubjectByLink

              NOTE:
                 DEVELOPER EmailSendingAccount is required.

                 DEVELOPER

              When  Amazon  Cognito emails your users, it uses your Amazon SES
              configuration. Amazon Cognito calls Amazon SES on your behalf to
              send  email  from your verified email address. When you use this
              option, the email delivery limits are the same limits that apply
              to your Amazon SES verified email address in your account.

              If  you  use  this option, you must provide the ARN of an Amazon
              SES verified email address for the SourceArn parameter.

              Before Amazon Cognito can email your users,  it  requires  addi-
              tional  permissions  to call Amazon SES on your behalf. When you
              update your user pool with this option, Amazon Cognito creates a
              service-linked  role  , which is a type of IAM role, in your ac-
              count. This role contains the permissions that allow Amazon Cog-
              nito  to access Amazon SES and send email messages with your ad-
              dress. For more information about the service-linked  role  that
              Amazon  Cognito creates, see Using Service-Linked Roles for Ama-
              zon Cognito in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          From -> (string)
              Identifies either the senders email address or the senders  name
              with  their  email address. For example, testuser@example.com or
              Test User <testuser@example.com> . This address will appear  be-
              fore the body of the email.

          ConfigurationSet -> (string)
              The  set  of  configuration  rules that can be applied to emails
              sent using Amazon SES. A configuration  set  is  applied  to  an
              email  by  including a reference to the configuration set in the
              headers of the email. Once applied, all of  the  rules  in  that
              configuration  set  are applied to the email. Configuration sets
              can be used to apply the following types of rules to emails:

              o Event publishing  Amazon SES can track the number of send, de-
                livery,  open,  click,  bounce,  and complaint events for each
                email sent. Use event publishing  to  send  information  about
                these events to other Amazon Web Services services such as SNS
                and CloudWatch.

              o IP pool management  When leasing dedicated IP  addresses  with
                Amazon SES, you can create groups of IP addresses, called ded-
                icated IP pools. You can then associate the dedicated IP pools
                with configuration sets.

              account  which  Cognito  will use to send SMS messages. SMS mes-
              sages are subject to a spending limit .

          ExternalId -> (string)
              The external ID is a value that we recommend you use to add  se-
              curity to your IAM role which is used to call Amazon SNS to send
              SMS messages for your user pool. If you provide an ExternalId  ,
              the  Cognito User Pool will include it when attempting to assume
              your IAM role, so that you can set your roles  trust  policy  to
              require  the ExternalID . If you use the Cognito Management Con-
              sole to create a role for SMS MFA, Cognito will  create  a  role
              with  the  required  permissions  and a trust policy that demon-
              strates use of the ExternalId .

              For more information about the ExternalId of a role, see How  to
              use  an external ID when granting access to your Amazon Web Ser-
              vices resources to a third party

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SnsCallerArn=string,ExternalId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SnsCallerArn": "string",
            "ExternalId": "string"
          }

       --user-pool-tags (map)
          The tag keys and values to assign to the user pool. A tag is a label
          that  you  can  use to categorize and manage user pools in different
          ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --admin-create-user-config (structure)
          The configuration for AdminCreateUser requests.

          AllowAdminCreateUserOnly -> (boolean)
              Set to True if only the administrator is allowed to create  user
              profiles.  Set  to  False if users can sign themselves up via an
              app.

          UnusedAccountValidityDays -> (integer)
              The user account expiration limit, in days, after which the  ac-
              count  is no longer usable. To reset the account after that time
              limit, you must call AdminCreateUser again, specifying  "RESEND"
              for  the MessageAction parameter. The default value for this pa-
              rameter is 7.

              NOTE:
                 If you set a value for TemporaryPasswordValidityDays in Pass-
                 wordPolicy , that value will be used and UnusedAccountValidi-
                 tyDays will be deprecated for that user pool.

          InviteMessageTemplate -> (structure)
              The message template to be used for the welcome message  to  new
              users.

              See also Customizing User Invitation Messages .

              SMSMessage -> (string)
                 The message template for SMS messages.

              EmailMessage -> (string)
                 The  message template for email messages. EmailMessage is al-
                 lowed only if EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER.

              EmailSubject -> (string)
                 The subject line for email messages. EmailSubject is  allowed
                 only if EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AllowAdminCreateUserOnly=boolean,UnusedAccountValidityDays=integer,InviteMessageTemplate={SMSMessage=string,EmailMessage=string,EmailSubject=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AllowAdminCreateUserOnly": true|false,
            "UnusedAccountValidityDays": integer,
            "InviteMessageTemplate": {
              "SMSMessage": "string",
              "EmailMessage": "string",
              "EmailSubject": "string"
            }
          }

       --schema (list)
          An  array  of  schema  attributes  for  the new user pool. These at-
          tributes can be standard or custom attributes.

          (structure)
              Contains information about the schema attribute.

              Name -> (string)
                 A schema attribute of the name type.

              AttributeDataType -> (string)
                 The attribute data type.

              DeveloperOnlyAttribute -> (boolean)

                 NOTE:
                     We recommend that you use  WriteAttributes  in  the  user
                     pool  client to control how attributes can be mutated for
                     new use cases instead of using DeveloperOnlyAttribute .

                 Specifies whether the attribute type is developer only.  This
                 attribute  can  only  be  modified by an administrator. Users
                 will not be able to modify this attribute using their  access
                 token.  For  example,  DeveloperOnlyAttribute can be modified
                 using AdminUpdateUserAttributes but cannot be  updated  using
                 UpdateUserAttributes.

              Mutable -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the value of the attribute can be changed.

                 For  any  user  pool  attribute  that's mapped to an identity
                 provider attribute, you must set this  parameter  to  true  .
                 Amazon  Cognito  updates mapped attributes when users sign in
                 to your application through an identity provider. If  an  at-
                 tribute  is immutable, Amazon Cognito throws an error when it
                 attempts to update the attribute. For more  information,  see
                 Specifying Identity Provider Attribute Mappings for Your User
                 Pool .

              Required -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether a user pool attribute is required.  If  the
                 attribute  is required and the user does not provide a value,
                 registration or sign-in will fail.

              NumberAttributeConstraints -> (structure)
                 Specifies the constraints for  an  attribute  of  the  number
                 type.

                 MinValue -> (string)
                     The  minimum  value of an attribute that is of the number
                     data type.

                 MaxValue -> (string)
                     The maximum value of an attribute that is of  the  number
                     data type.

              StringAttributeConstraints -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the  constraints  for  an  attribute of the string
                 type.

                 MinLength -> (string)
                     The minimum length.

                 MaxLength -> (string)
                     The maximum length.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,AttributeDataType=string,DeveloperOnlyAttribute=boolean,Mutable=boolean,Required=boolean,NumberAttributeConstraints={MinValue=string,MaxValue=string},StringAttributeConstraints={MinLength=string,MaxLength=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "AttributeDataType": "String"|"Number"|"DateTime"|"Boolean",

              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --user-pool-add-ons (structure)
          Used to enable advanced security risk detection.  Set  the  key  Ad-
          vancedSecurityMode to the value "AUDIT".

          AdvancedSecurityMode -> (string)
              The advanced security mode.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AdvancedSecurityMode=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AdvancedSecurityMode": "OFF"|"AUDIT"|"ENFORCED"
          }

       --username-configuration (structure)
          You can choose to set case sensitivity on the username input for the
          selected sign-in option. For example, when this is set  to  False  ,
          users will be able to sign in using either "username" or "Username".
          This configuration is immutable once it has been set. For  more  in-
          formation, see UsernameConfigurationType .

          CaseSensitive -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether username case sensitivity will be applied for
              all users in the user pool through Cognito APIs.

              Valid values include:

              o

                **
                True ** : Enables case sensitivity  for  all  username  input.
                When this option is set to True , users must sign in using the
                exact capitalization of their  given  username.  For  example,
                UserName. This is the default value.

              o

                **
                False  ** : Enables case insensitivity for all username input.
                For example, when this option is set to False , users will  be
                able  to  sign  in using either "username" or "Username". This
                option also enables both preferred_username and email alias to
                be case insensitive, in addition to the username attribute.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CaseSensitive=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CaseSensitive": true|false
          }

       --account-recovery-setting (structure)
          Use  this  setting  to define which verified available method a user
          can use to recover their password when they call ForgotPassword . It
          allows  you  to  define a preferred method when a user has more than
          one method available. With this setting, SMS does not qualify for  a
          valid  password  recovery mechanism if the user also has SMS MFA en-
          abled. In the absence of this setting, Cognito uses the  legacy  be-
          havior  to determine the recovery method where SMS is preferred over
          email.

          RecoveryMechanisms -> (list)
              The list of RecoveryOptionTypes .

              (structure)
                 A map containing a priority as a  key,  and  recovery  method
                 name as a value.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     A positive integer specifying priority of a method with 1
                     being the highest priority.

                 Name -> (string)
                     Specifies the recovery method for a user.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RecoveryMechanisms=[{Priority=integer,Name=string},{Priority=integer,Name=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RecoveryMechanisms": [
              {
                "Priority": integer,
                "Name": "verified_email"|"verified_phone_number"|"admin_only"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a minimally configured user pool

       This example creates a user pool named MyUserPool using default values.
       There  are  no  required attributes and no application clients. MFA and
       advanced security is disabled.

       To create a user pool with two required attributes

       This example creates a user pool MyUserPool. The pool is configured  to
       accept email as a username attribute. It also sets the email source ad-
       dress to a validated address using Amazon Simple Email Service.

       Command:

          aws cognito-idp create-user-pool --pool-name MyUserPool --username-attributes "email" --email-configuration=SourceArn="arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:111111111111:identity/jane@example.com",ReplyToEmailAddress="jane@example.com"

                 DeveloperOnlyAttribute -> (boolean)

                     NOTE:
                        We  recommend that you use WriteAttributes in the user
                        pool client to control how attributes can  be  mutated
                        for  new  use  cases instead of using DeveloperOnlyAt-
                        tribute .

                     Specifies whether the attribute type is  developer  only.
                     This  attribute can only be modified by an administrator.
                     Users will not be able to  modify  this  attribute  using
                     their  access  token. For example, DeveloperOnlyAttribute
                     can be modified using AdminUpdateUserAttributes but  can-
                     not be updated using UpdateUserAttributes.

                 Mutable -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  the  value  of  the  attribute can be
                     changed.

                     For any user pool attribute that's mapped to an  identity
                     provider attribute, you must set this parameter to true .
                     Amazon Cognito updates mapped attributes when users  sign
                     in  to  your application through an identity provider. If
                     an attribute is immutable, Amazon Cognito throws an error
                     when it attempts to update the attribute. For more infor-
                     mation, see Specifying Identity Provider  Attribute  Map-
                     pings for Your User Pool .

                 Required -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  a user pool attribute is required. If
                     the attribute is required and the user does not provide a
                     value, registration or sign-in will fail.

                 NumberAttributeConstraints -> (structure)
                     Specifies  the constraints for an attribute of the number
                     type.

                        The  maximum value of an attribute that is of the num-
                        ber data type.

                     Specifies the constraints for an attribute of the  string
                     type.

                 The subject line for the email message template for sending a
                 confirmation  link to the user. EmailSubjectByLink is allowed
                 only EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER.

              DefaultEmailOption -> (string)
                 The default email option.

          SmsAuthenticationMessage -> (string)

              o OFF - MFA tokens are not required and cannot be specified dur-
                ing user registration.

              o ON  -  MFA tokens are required for all user registrations. You
                can only specify required when you are  initially  creating  a
                user pool.

              o OPTIONAL - Users have the option when registering to create an
                MFA token.

          DeviceConfiguration -> (structure)
              The device configuration.

              ChallengeRequiredOnNewDevice -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether a challenge is required on  a  new  device.
                 Only applicable to a new device.

              DeviceOnlyRememberedOnUserPrompt -> (boolean)
                 If true, a device is only remembered on user prompt.

          EstimatedNumberOfUsers -> (integer)
              A number estimating the size of the user pool.

          EmailConfiguration -> (structure)
              The email configuration.

              SourceArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a verified email address in
                 Amazon SES. This email address is used in one of the  follow-
                 ing  ways,  depending  on  the value that you specify for the
                 EmailSendingAccount parameter:

                 o If you specify COGNITO_DEFAULT , Amazon Cognito  uses  this
                   address  as  the  custom  FROM  address when it emails your
                   users by using its built-in email account.

                 o If you specify DEVELOPER , Amazon Cognito emails your users
                   with this address by calling Amazon SES on your behalf.

              ReplyToEmailAddress -> (string)
                 The destination to which the receiver of the email should re-
                 ply to.

              EmailSendingAccount -> (string)
                 Specifies whether Amazon Cognito emails your users  by  using
                 its  built-in  email  functionality  or your Amazon SES email
                 configuration. Specify one of the following values:
                     COGNITO_DEFAULT

                 When Amazon Cognito emails your users, it uses  its  built-in
                 email  functionality. When you use the default option, Amazon
                 Cognito allows only a limited number of emails each  day  for
                 your  user pool. For typical production environments, the de-
                 fault email limit is below the required delivery  volume.  To
                 achieve  a  higher  delivery volume, specify DEVELOPER to use
                 your Amazon SES email configuration.

                 To look up the email delivery limit for the  default  option,
                 see  Limits in Amazon Cognito in the Amazon Cognito Developer
                 Guide .

                 The default FROM address  is  no-reply@verificationemail.com.
                 To  customize  the FROM address, provide the ARN of an Amazon
                 SES verified email address for the SourceArn parameter.

                 If EmailSendingAccount is COGNITO_DEFAULT, the following  pa-
                 rameters aren't allowed:

                 o EmailVerificationMessage

                 o EmailVerificationSubject

                 o InviteMessageTemplate.EmailMessage

                 o InviteMessageTemplate.EmailSubject

                 o VerificationMessageTemplate.EmailMessage

                 o VerificationMessageTemplate.EmailMessageByLink

                 o VerificationMessageTemplate.EmailSubject,

                 o VerificationMessageTemplate.EmailSubjectByLink

                 NOTE:
                     DEVELOPER EmailSendingAccount is required.

                     DEVELOPER

                 When  Amazon  Cognito  emails your users, it uses your Amazon
                 SES configuration. Amazon Cognito calls Amazon  SES  on  your
                 behalf  to  send email from your verified email address. When
                 you use this option, the email delivery limits are  the  same
                 limits  that  apply to your Amazon SES verified email address
                 in your account.

                 If you use this option, you must provide the ARN of an Amazon
                 SES verified email address for the SourceArn parameter.

                 Before Amazon Cognito can email your users, it requires addi-
                 tional permissions to call Amazon SES on  your  behalf.  When
                 you  update  your  user pool with this option, Amazon Cognito
                 creates a service-linked role , which is a type of IAM  role,
                 in  your account. This role contains the permissions that al-
                 low Amazon Cognito to access Amazon SES and send  email  mes-
                 sages  with your address. For more information about the ser-
                 vice-linked role that Amazon Cognito creates, see Using  Ser-
                 vice-Linked  Roles  for  Amazon Cognito in the Amazon Cognito
                 Developer Guide .

              From -> (string)
                 Identifies either the senders email address  or  the  senders
                 name  with  their  email address. For example, testuser@exam-
                 ple.com or Test User <testuser@example.com>  .  This  address
                 will appear before the body of the email.

              ConfigurationSet -> (string)
                 The  set of configuration rules that can be applied to emails
                 sent using Amazon SES. A configuration set is applied  to  an
                 email  by  including  a reference to the configuration set in
                 the headers of the email. Once applied, all of the  rules  in
                 that  configuration  set are applied to the email. Configura-
                 tion sets can be used to apply the following types  of  rules
                 to emails:

                 o Event  publishing  Amazon SES can track the number of send,
                   delivery, open, click, bounce,  and  complaint  events  for
                   each  email  sent. Use event publishing to send information
                   about these events to other Amazon  Web  Services  services
                   such as SNS and CloudWatch.

                 o IP  pool  management   When  leasing dedicated IP addresses
                   with Amazon SES, you can create  groups  of  IP  addresses,
                   called dedicated IP pools. You can then associate the dedi-
                   cated IP pools with configuration sets.

          SmsConfiguration -> (structure)
              The SMS configuration.

              SnsCallerArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Simple Notifica-
                 tion Service (SNS) caller. This is the ARN of the IAM role in
                 your account which Cognito will use to send SMS messages. SMS
                 messages are subject to a spending limit .

              ExternalId -> (string)
                 The  external  ID is a value that we recommend you use to add
                 security to your IAM role which is used to call Amazon SNS to
                 send  SMS  messages for your user pool. If you provide an Ex-
                 ternalId , the Cognito User Pool will  include  it  when  at-
                 tempting  to  assume  your IAM role, so that you can set your
                 roles trust policy to require the ExternalID . If you use the
                 Cognito Management Console to create a role for SMS MFA, Cog-
                 nito will create a role with the required permissions  and  a
                 trust policy that demonstrates use of the ExternalId .

                 For  more information about the ExternalId of a role, see How
                 to use an external ID when granting access to your Amazon Web
                 Services resources to a third party

          UserPoolTags -> (map)
              The  tags  that  are assigned to the user pool. A tag is a label
              that you can apply to user pools to categorize and  manage  them
              in  different  ways,  such as by purpose, owner, environment, or
              other criteria.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          SmsConfigurationFailure -> (string)
              The reason why the SMS configuration cannot send the messages to
              your users.

              This  message  might  include comma-separated values to describe
              why your SMS configuration can't send messages to user pool  end
              users.

              o InvalidSmsRoleAccessPolicyException  - The IAM role which Cog-
                nito uses to send SMS messages is not properly configured. For
                more information, see SmsConfigurationType .

              o SNSSandbox  -  The account is in SNS Sandbox and messages wont
                reach unverified end users. This parameter wont get  populated
                with  SNSSandbox if the IAM user creating the user pool doesnt
                have SNS permissions. To learn how to move your account out of
                the sandbox, see Moving out of the SMS sandbox .

          EmailConfigurationFailure -> (string)
              The  reason why the email configuration cannot send the messages
              to your users.

          Domain -> (string)
              Holds the domain prefix if the user pool has a domain associated
              with it.

          CustomDomain -> (string)
              A  custom  domain  name that you provide to Amazon Cognito. This
              parameter applies only if you use a custom domain  to  host  the
              sign-up  and  sign-in  pages  for your application. For example:
              auth.example.com .

              For more information about adding a custom domain to  your  user
              pool, see Using Your Own Domain for the Hosted UI .

          AdminCreateUserConfig -> (structure)
              The configuration for AdminCreateUser requests.

              AllowAdminCreateUserOnly -> (boolean)
                 Set  to  True  if only the administrator is allowed to create
                 user profiles. Set to False if users can sign  themselves  up
                 via an app.

              UnusedAccountValidityDays -> (integer)
                 The  user  account expiration limit, in days, after which the
                 account is no longer usable. To reset the account after  that
                 time  limit,  you must call AdminCreateUser again, specifying
                 "RESEND" for the MessageAction parameter. The  default  value
                 for this parameter is 7.

                 NOTE:
                     If  you  set a value for TemporaryPasswordValidityDays in
                     PasswordPolicy , that value will be  used  and  UnusedAc-
                     countValidityDays will be deprecated for that user pool.

              InviteMessageTemplate -> (structure)
                 The  message  template  to be used for the welcome message to
                 new users.

                 See also Customizing User Invitation Messages .

                 SMSMessage -> (string)
                     The message template for SMS messages.

                 EmailMessage -> (string)
                     The message template for email messages. EmailMessage  is
                     allowed only if EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER.

                 EmailSubject -> (string)
                     The  subject line for email messages. EmailSubject is al-
                     lowed only if EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER.

          UserPoolAddOns -> (structure)
              The user pool add-ons.

              AdvancedSecurityMode -> (string)
                 The advanced security mode.

          UsernameConfiguration -> (structure)
              You can choose to enable case sensitivity on the username  input
              for  the  selected sign-in option. For example, when this is set
              to False , users will be able to sign in using either "username"
              or  "Username". This configuration is immutable once it has been
              set. For more information, see UsernameConfigurationType .

              CaseSensitive -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether username case sensitivity will  be  applied
                 for all users in the user pool through Cognito APIs.

                 Valid values include:

                 o

                   **
                   True  ** : Enables case sensitivity for all username input.
                   When this option is set to True , users must sign in  using
                   the exact capitalization of their given username. For exam-
                   ple, UserName. This is the default value.

                 o

                   **
                   False ** : Enables case insensitivity for all username  in-
                   put.  For example, when this option is set to False , users
                   will be able to sign in using either "username"  or  "User-
                   name". This option also enables both preferred_username and
                   email alias to be case  insensitive,  in  addition  to  the
                   username attribute.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the user pool.

          AccountRecoverySetting -> (structure)
              Use  this  setting  to  define which verified available method a
              user can use to recover their password when  they  call  Forgot-
              Password  .  It  allows  you to define a preferred method when a
              user has more than one method available. With this setting,  SMS
              does  not qualify for a valid password recovery mechanism if the
              user also has SMS MFA enabled. In the absence of  this  setting,
              Cognito  uses  the  legacy  behavior  to  determine the recovery
              method where SMS is preferred over email.

              RecoveryMechanisms -> (list)
                 The list of RecoveryOptionTypes .

                 (structure)
                     A map containing a priority as a key, and recovery method
                     name as a value.

                     Priority -> (integer)
                        A  positive  integer  specifying  priority of a method
                        with 1 being the highest priority.

                     Name -> (string)
                        Specifies the recovery method for a user.
