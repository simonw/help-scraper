SYNOPSIS
            confirm-sign-up
          --client-id <value>
          [--secret-hash <value>]
          --username <value>
          --confirmation-code <value>
          [--force-alias-creation | --no-force-alias-creation]
          [--analytics-metadata <value>]
          [--user-context-data <value>]
          [--client-metadata <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-id (string)
          The ID of the app client associated with the user pool.

       --secret-hash (string)
          A keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) calculated using the
          secret  key of a user pool client and username plus the client ID in
          the message.

       --username (string)
          The user name of the user whose registration you want to confirm.

       --confirmation-code (string)
          The confirmation code sent by a user's request to confirm  registra-
          tion.

       --force-alias-creation | --no-force-alias-creation (boolean)
          Boolean  to  be specified to force user confirmation irrespective of
          existing alias. By default set to False . If this parameter  is  set
          to True and the phone number/email used for sign up confirmation al-
          ready exists as an alias with a different user, the  API  call  will
          migrate  the  alias from the previous user to the newly created user
          being confirmed. If set to False , the API will throw an AliasExist-
          sException error.

       --analytics-metadata (structure)
          The  Amazon  Pinpoint  analytics metadata for collecting metrics for
          ConfirmSignUp calls.

          AnalyticsEndpointId -> (string)
              The endpoint ID.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AnalyticsEndpointId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AnalyticsEndpointId": "string"
          }

       --user-context-data (structure)
          Contextual data such as the user's device fingerprint,  IP  address,
          or  location  used for evaluating the risk of an unexpected event by
          Amazon Cognito advanced security.

          EncodedData -> (string)
              Contextual data, such as the user's device fingerprint,  IP  ad-
              dress,  or  location,  used  for evaluating the risk of an unex-
              pected event by Amazon Cognito advanced security.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EncodedData=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "EncodedData": "string"
          }

       --client-metadata (map)
          A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide  as  input  for
          any custom workflows that this action triggers.

          You  create  custom  workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user
          pool triggers. When you use the  ConfirmSignUp  API  action,  Amazon
          Cognito  invokes the function that is assigned to the post confirma-
          tion trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a
          JSON  payload,  which  the  function receives as input. This payload
          contains a clientMetadata attribute, which provides  the  data  that
          you  assigned  to the ClientMetadata parameter in your ConfirmSignUp
          request. In your function  code  in  Lambda,  you  can  process  the
          clientMetadata  value  to  enhance  your  workflow for your specific
          needs.

          For more information,  see  Customizing  user  pool  Workflows  with
          Lambda Triggers in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              When  you use the ClientMetadata parameter, remember that Amazon
              Cognito won't do the following:

              o Store the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to
                Lambda  triggers  that  are assigned to a user pool to support
                custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't  in-
                clude  triggers,  the  ClientMetadata parameter serves no pur-
                pose.

              o Validate the ClientMetadata value.

              o Encrypt the ClientMetadata value. Don't use Amazon Cognito  to
                provide sensitive information.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
