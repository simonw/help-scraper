SYNOPSIS
            get-multi-region-access-point-policy-status
          --account-id <value>
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID for the owner of the Multi-Region
          Access Point.

       --name (string)
          Specifies  the  Multi-Region Access Point. The name of the Multi-Re-
          gion Access Point is different from the alias. For more  information
          about the distinction between the name and the alias of an Multi-Re-
          gion Access Point, see Managing Multi-Region Access  Points  in  the
          Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          formation  about  how  Amazon  S3  evaluates  policies  to determine

          S3 User Guide .
