PUT-ACCESS-POINT-POLICY()                            PUT-ACCESS-POINT-POLICY()



NAME
       put-access-point-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  an  access policy with the specified access point. Each ac-
       cess point can have only one policy, so a request made to this API  re-
       places any existing policy associated with the specified access point.

       All  Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an
       additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the  request
       and  an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control .
       For an example of the request syntax for Amazon  S3  on  Outposts  that
       uses  the  S3  on  Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the x-amz-out-
       post-id derived using the access point ARN, see the Examples section.

       The following actions are related to PutAccessPointPolicy :

       o GetAccessPointPolicy

       o DeleteAccessPointPolicy

SYNOPSIS
            put-access-point-policy
          --account-id <value>
          --name <value>
          --policy <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID for owner of the  bucket  associ-
          ated with the specified access point.

       --name (string)
          The  name  of  the  access point that you want to associate with the
          specified policy.

          For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts  with  the  REST
          API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

          For  using  this  parameter  with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web
          Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the  access  point
          accessed    in    the    format    arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<ac-
          count-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/accesspoint/<my-accesspoint-name>   .
          For  example,  to access the access point reports-ap through outpost
          my-outpost owned by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2  ,  use
          the  URL encoding of arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:out-
          post/my-outpost/accesspoint/reports-ap . The value must be  URL  en-
          coded.

       --policy (string)
          The policy that you want to apply to the specified access point. For
          more information about access point policies, see Managing data  ac-
          cess with Amazon S3 access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To set an access point policy

       The following put-access-point-policy example places the specified  ac-
       cess   point   policy  for  the  access  point  finance-ap  in  account
       123456789012. If the access point finance-ap already has a policy, this
       command  replaces  the  existing  policy with the one specified in this
       command. Before running this example, replace the account  number,  ac-
       cess point name, and policy statements with appropriate values for your
       use case.

          aws s3control put-access-point-policy \
              --account-id 123456789012 \
              --name finance-ap \
              --policy file://ap-policy.json

       Contents of ap-policy.json:

          {
              "Version": "2012-10-17",
              "Statement": [
                  {
                      "Effect": "Allow",
                      "Principal": {
                          "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Alice"
                      },
                      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/finance-ap/object/Alice/*"
                  }
              ]
          }

       This command produces no output.
