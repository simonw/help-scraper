NAME
       get-bucket-lifecycle-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This action gets an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket's lifecycle config-
          uration.  To  get  an  S3  bucket's  lifecycle  configuration,   see
          GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration in the Amazon S3 API Reference .

       Returns  the  lifecycle  configuration  information set on the Outposts
       bucket. For more information, see Using Amazon S3 on Outposts  and  for
       information about lifecycle configuration, see Object Lifecycle Manage-
       ment in Amazon S3 User Guide .

       To use this action, you must have permission  to  perform  the  s3-out-
       posts:GetLifecycleConfiguration  action.  The Outposts bucket owner has
       this permission, by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission
       to  others. For more information about permissions, see Permissions Re-
       lated to Bucket Subresource Operations and Managing Access  Permissions
       to Your Amazon S3 Resources .

       All  Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an
       additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request.
       In  addition,  you  must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix
       instead of s3-control . For an example of the request syntax for Amazon
       S3  on  Outposts  that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix
       and the x-amz-outpost-id derived by using the access point ARN, see the
       Examples section.
          GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration has the following special error:

       o Error code: NoSuchLifecycleConfiguration

         o Description: The lifecycle configuration does not exist.

         o HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found

         o SOAP Fault Code Prefix: Client

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID of the Outposts bucket.

       --bucket (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the bucket.

          For  using  this  parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST
          API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

          For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts  with  the  Amazon  Web
          Services  SDK  and  CLI,  you must specify the ARN of the bucket ac-
          cessed in the format  arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:out-
          post/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>  .  For example, to access
          the bucket reports  through  Outpost  my-outpost  owned  by  account
          123456789012   in  Region  us-west-2  ,  use  the  URL  encoding  of
          arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-out-
          post/bucket/reports . The value must be URL encoded.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,

                 scribes  when  noncurrent  objects  transition  to a specific
                 storage class. If your bucket is versioning-enabled (or  ver-
                 sioning  is  suspended),  you  can set this action to request
                 that Amazon S3 transition noncurrent  object  versions  to  a
                 specific  storage class at a set period in the object's life-
                 time.

                 NOTE:

                     Specifies how many noncurrent  versions  S3  on  Outposts
                     will  retain.  If there are this many more recent noncur-
                     rent versions, S3 on Outposts will  take  the  associated
                     action.  For  more information about noncurrent versions,
                     see Lifecycle configuration elements  in  the  Amazon  S3
