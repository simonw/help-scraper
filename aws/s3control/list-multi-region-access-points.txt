DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of the Multi-Region Access Points currently associated
       with the specified Amazon Web Services account. Each call can return up
       to  100  Multi-Region Access Points, the maximum number of Multi-Region
       Access Points that can be associated with a single account.

       This action will always be routed to the US West (Oregon)  Region.  For
       more  information  about  the restrictions around managing Multi-Region
       Access Points, see Managing Multi-Region Access Points in the Amazon S3
       User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            list-multi-region-access-points
          --account-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID for the owner of the Multi-Region
          Access Point.

       --next-token (string)
          Not currently used. Do not use this parameter.

       --max-results (integer)
          Not currently used. Do not use this parameter.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AccessPoints -> (list)
          The list of Multi-Region Access Points associated with the user.

          (structure)
              A  collection of statuses for a Multi-Region Access Point in the
              various Regions it supports.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the Multi-Region Access Point.

              Alias -> (string)
                 The alias for the Multi-Region Access Point. For more  infor-
                 mation  about  the distinction between the name and the alias
                 of an Multi-Region Access Point,  see  Managing  Multi-Region
                 Access Points .

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 When  the  Multi-Region  Access  Point create request was re-
                 ceived.

              PublicAccessBlock -> (structure)
                 The PublicAccessBlock configuration that you want to apply to
                 this  Amazon S3 account. You can enable the configuration op-
                 tions in any combination. For  more  information  about  when
                 Amazon  S3 considers a bucket or object public, see The Mean-
                 ing of "Public" in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                 This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

                 BlockPublicAcls -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether Amazon S3 should  block  public  access
                     control lists (ACLs) for buckets in this account. Setting
                     this element to TRUE causes the following behavior:

                     o PUT Bucket acl and PUT Object acl  calls  fail  if  the
                       specified ACL is public.

                     o PUT  Object calls fail if the request includes a public
                       ACL.

                     o PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a  public
                       ACL.

                     Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing policies or
                     ACLs.

                     This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

                 IgnorePublicAcls -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for
                     buckets  in  this  account.  Setting this element to TRUE
                     causes Amazon S3 to ignore all public ACLs on buckets  in
                     this account and any objects that they contain.

                     Enabling  this  setting doesn't affect the persistence of
                     any existing ACLs and doesn't  prevent  new  public  ACLs
                     from being set.

                     This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

                 BlockPublicPolicy -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  Amazon  S3 should block public bucket
                     policies for buckets in this account. Setting  this  ele-
                     ment  to  TRUE  causes  Amazon  S3 to reject calls to PUT
                     Bucket policy if the specified bucket policy allows  pub-
                     lic access.

                     Enabling  this  setting  doesn't  affect  existing bucket
                     policies.

                     This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

                 RestrictPublicBuckets -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether Amazon S3 should restrict public bucket
                     policies  for  buckets in this account. Setting this ele-
                     ment to TRUE restricts  access  to  buckets  with  public
                     policies to only Amazon Web Service principals and autho-
                     rized users within this account.

                     Enabling this setting doesn't  affect  previously  stored
                     bucket policies, except that public and cross-account ac-
                     cess within any public bucket policy, including  non-pub-
                     lic delegation to specific accounts, is blocked.

                     This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status of the Multi-Region Access Point.
                     CREATING  and  DELETING  are  temporary states that exist
                     while the request is propogating and being completed.  If
                     a   Multi-Region  Access  Point  has  a  status  of  PAR-
                     TIALLY_CREATED , you can retry creation or send a request
                     to  delete  the Multi-Region Access Point. If a Multi-Re-
                     gion Access Point has a status of PARTIALLY_DELETED , you
                     can  retry a delete request to finish the deletion of the
                     Multi-Region Access Point.

              Regions -> (list)
                 A collection of the Regions and buckets associated  with  the
                 Multi-Region Access Point.

                 (structure)
                     A  combination  of  a  bucket and Region that's part of a
                     Multi-Region Access Point.

                     Bucket -> (string)
                        The name of the bucket.

                     Region -> (string)
                        The name of the Region.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the specified bucket has more Multi-Region Access Points than can
          be  returned  in one call to this action, this field contains a con-
          tinuation token. You can use this token tin subsequent calls to this
          action to retrieve additional Multi-Region Access Points.
