SYNOPSIS
            list-jobs
          --account-id <value>
          [--job-statuses <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the S3 Batch  Op-
          erations job.

       --job-statuses (list)
          The List Jobs request returns jobs that match the statuses listed in
          this element.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            Active
            Cancelled
            Cancelling
            Complete
            Completing
            Failed
            Failing
            New
            Paused
            Pausing
            Preparing
            Ready
            Suspended

       --next-token (string)
          A pagination token to request the next page of results. Use the  to-
          ken that Amazon S3 returned in the NextToken element of the ListJob-
          sResult from the previous List Jobs request.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of jobs that Amazon S3 will include in  the  List
          Jobs response. If there are more jobs than this number, the response
          will include a pagination token in the NextToken field to enable you
          to retrieve the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
