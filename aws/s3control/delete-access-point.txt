NAME
       delete-access-point -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the specified access point.

       All  Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an
       additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the  request
       and  an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control .
       For an example of the request syntax for Amazon  S3  on  Outposts  that
       uses  the  S3  on  Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the x-amz-out-
       post-id derived using the access point ARN, see the Examples section.

       The following actions are related to DeleteAccessPoint :

       o CreateAccessPoint

       o GetAccessPoint

       o ListAccessPoints

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-access-point
          --account-id <value>
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The account ID for the account that owns the specified access point.

       --name (string)
          The name of the access point you want to delete.

          For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts  with  the  REST
          API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

          For  using  this  parameter  with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web
          Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the  access  point
          accessed    in    the    format    arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<ac-
          count-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/accesspoint/<my-accesspoint-name>   .
          For  example,  to access the access point reports-ap through outpost
          my-outpost owned by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2  ,  use
          the  URL encoding of arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:out-
          post/my-outpost/accesspoint/reports-ap . The value must be  URL  en-
          coded.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete an access point

       The following delete-access-point example deletes an access point named

       place the access point name and account number with appropriate  values
       for your use case.
