CREATE-JOB()                                                      CREATE-JOB()



NAME
       create-job -

DESCRIPTION
       You can use S3 Batch Operations to perform large-scale batch actions on
       Amazon S3 objects. Batch Operations can run a single action on lists of
       Amazon  S3 objects that you specify. For more information, see S3 Batch
       Operations in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       This action creates a S3 Batch Operations job.

       Related actions include:

       o DescribeJob

       o ListJobs

       o UpdateJobPriority

       o UpdateJobStatus

       o JobOperation

       See also: AWS API Documentation

                 object encryption with server-side  encryption  using  Amazon
                 Web  Services  KMS  (SSE-KMS).  Setting  this  header to true
                 causes Amazon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key for  object  encryp-
                 tion with SSE-KMS.

                 Specifying  this  header  with an object action doesnt affect
                 bucket-level settings for S3 Bucket Key.

                            Permission -> (string)

                 CannedAccessControlList -> (string)

              every object in the manifest.

              TagSet -> (list)
                 (structure)
                     Key -> (string)

              call on every object in the manifest.

          S3InitiateRestoreObject -> (structure)
              Directs the specified job to initiate restore requests for every
              archived object in the manifest.

              ExpirationInDays -> (integer)
                 This argument specifies how long the S3 Glacier Flexible  Re-
                 trieval  or  S3 Glacier Deep Archive object remains available
                 in Amazon S3. S3 Initiate Restore Object jobs that target  S3
                 Glacier  Flexible  Retrieval  and S3 Glacier Deep Archive ob-
                 jects require ExpirationInDays set to 1 or greater.

                 Conversely, do not set ExpirationInDays when creating S3 Ini-
                 tiate  Restore Object jobs that target S3 Intelligent-Tiering
                 Archive Access and Deep Archive Access tier objects.  Objects
                 in  S3  Intelligent-Tiering archive access tiers are not sub-
                 ject to restore expiry, so  specifying  ExpirationInDays  re-
                 sults in restore request failure.

                 S3  Batch  Operations  jobs  can operate either on S3 Glacier
                 Flexible Retrieval and S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage  class
                 objects  or on S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access and Deep
                 Archive Access storage tier objects, but not  both  types  in
                 the  same  job.  If you need to restore objects of both types
                 you must create separate Batch Operations jobs.

              GlacierJobTier -> (string)
                 S3 Batch Operations  supports  STANDARD  and  BULK  retrieval
                 tiers, but not the EXPEDITED retrieval tier.

          S3PutObjectLegalHold -> (structure)
              Contains  the configuration for an S3 Object Lock legal hold op-
              eration that an S3 Batch Operations job passes every  object  to
              the underlying PutObjectLegalHold API. For more information, see
              Using S3 Object Lock legal hold with S3 Batch Operations in  the
              Amazon S3 User Guide .

              LegalHold -> (structure)
                 Contains  the  Object Lock legal hold status to be applied to
                 all objects in the Batch Operations job.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The Object Lock legal hold status to be  applied  to  all
                     objects in the Batch Operations job.

          S3PutObjectRetention -> (structure)
              Contains the configuration parameters for the Object Lock reten-
              tion action for an S3 Batch  Operations  job.  Batch  Operations
              passes  every  object  to the underlying PutObjectRetention API.
              For more information, see Using S3 Object Lock retention with S3
              Batch Operations in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              BypassGovernanceRetention -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  if  the action should be applied to objects in the
                 Batch Operations job even if they have Object Lock GOVERNANCE
                 type in place.

              Retention -> (structure)
                 Contains  the Object Lock retention mode to be applied to all
                 objects in the Batch Operations job.  For  more  information,
                 see  Using  S3 Object Lock retention with S3 Batch Operations
                 in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                 RetainUntilDate -> (timestamp)
                     The date when the applied Object Lock retention will  ex-
                     pire on all objects set by the Batch Operations job.

                 Mode -> (string)
                     The  Object  Lock retention mode to be applied to all ob-
                     jects in the Batch Operations job.

            }
          }

       --description (string)
          A  description  for this job. You can use any string within the per-
          mitted length. Descriptions don't need to be unique and can be  used
          for multiple jobs.

       --priority (integer)
          The  numerical priority for this job. Higher numbers indicate higher
          priority.

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the Identity and  Access  Manage-
          ment (IAM) role that Batch Operations will use to run this job's ac-
          tion on every object in the manifest.

       --tags (list)
          A set of tags to associate with the S3 Batch Operations job. This is
          an optional parameter.

          (structure)
              Key -> (string)

              Value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To create an Amazon S3 batch operations job

       The  following create-job example creates an Amazon S3 batch operations
       job to tag objects as confidential` in the bucket ``employee-records.

          aws s3control create-job \
              --account-id 123456789012 \
              --operation '{"S3PutObjectTagging": { "TagSet": [{"Key":"confidential", "Value":"true"}] }}' \
              --report '{"Bucket":"arn:aws:s3:::employee-records-logs","Prefix":"batch-op-create-job", "Format":"Report_CSV_20180820","Enabled":true,"ReportScope":"AllTasks"}' \
              --manifest '{"Spec":{"Format":"S3BatchOperations_CSV_20180820","Fields":["Bucket","Key"]},"Location":{"ObjectArn":"arn:aws:s3:::employee-records-logs/inv-report/7a6a9be4-072c-407e-85a2-ec3e982f773e.csv","ETag":"69f52a4e9f797e987155d9c8f5880897"}}' \
              --priority 42 \
              --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3BatchJobRole

       Output:

          {
              "JobId": "93735294-df46-44d5-8638-6356f335324e"
          }

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
          The ID for this job. Amazon S3 generates this ID  automatically  and
          returns it after a successful Create Job request.
