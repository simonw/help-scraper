SYNOPSIS
            get-public-access-block
          --account-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  account  ID for the Amazon Web Services account whose PublicAc-
          cessBlock configuration you want to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list public block access settings for an account

       The following get-public-access-block example displays the block public
       access settings for the specified account.

          aws s3control get-public-access-block \
              --account-id 123456789012

       Output:

          {
             "PublicAccessBlockConfiguration": {
                "BlockPublicPolicy": true,
                "RestrictPublicBuckets": true,
                "IgnorePublicAcls": true,
                "BlockPublicAcls": true
             }
          }

OUTPUT
       PublicAccessBlockConfiguration -> (structure)
          The PublicAccessBlock configuration currently  in  effect  for  this
          Amazon Web Services account.

          BlockPublicAcls -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  Amazon S3 should block public access control
              lists (ACLs) for buckets in this account. Setting  this  element
              to TRUE causes the following behavior:

              o PUT  Bucket acl and PUT Object acl calls fail if the specified
                ACL is public.

              o PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

              o PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing policies or ACLs.

              This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          IgnorePublicAcls -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for  buck-
              ets  in this account. Setting this element to TRUE causes Amazon
              S3 to ignore all public ACLs on buckets in this account and  any
              objects that they contain.

              Enabling  this setting doesn't affect the persistence of any ex-
              isting ACLs and doesn't prevent new public ACLs from being set.

              This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          BlockPublicPolicy -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket  policies
              for buckets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE causes
              Amazon S3 to reject calls to PUT Bucket policy if the  specified
              bucket policy allows public access.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing bucket policies.

              This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          RestrictPublicBuckets -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether Amazon S3 should restrict public bucket poli-
              cies for buckets in this account. Setting this element  to  TRUE
              restricts  access to buckets with public policies to only Amazon
              Web Service principals and authorized users within this account.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect  previously  stored  bucket
              policies, except that public and cross-account access within any
              public bucket policy, including non-public  delegation  to  spe-
              cific accounts, is blocked.

              This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.
