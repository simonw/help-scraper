LIST-ACCESS-POINTS-FOR-OBJECT-LAMBDA()  LIST-ACCESS-POINTS-FOR-OBJECT-LAMBDA()



NAME
       list-access-points-for-object-lambda -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of the access points associated with the Object Lambda
       Access Point. You can retrieve up to 1000 access points  per  call.  If
       there  are  more  than  1,000 access points (or the number specified in
       maxResults , whichever is less), the response will include a  continua-
       tion token that you can use to list the additional access points.

       The following actions are related to ListAccessPointsForObjectLambda :

       o CreateAccessPointForObjectLambda

       o DeleteAccessPointForObjectLambda

       o GetAccessPointForObjectLambda

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-access-points-for-object-lambda is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: ObjectLambdaAccessPointList

SYNOPSIS
            list-access-points-for-object-lambda
          --account-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The account ID for the account that owns the specified Object Lambda
          Access Point.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ObjectLambdaAccessPointList -> (list)
          Returns list of Object Lambda Access Points.

          (structure)
              An  access point with an attached Lambda function used to access
              transformed data from an Amazon S3 bucket.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the Object Lambda Access Point.

              ObjectLambdaAccessPointArn -> (string)
                 Specifies the ARN for the Object Lambda Access Point.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the list has more access points than can be returned in one  call
          to  this  API, this field contains a continuation token that you can
          provide in subsequent calls to this API to retrieve  additional  ac-
          cess points.
