SYNOPSIS
            put-public-access-block
          --public-access-block-configuration <value>
          --account-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --public-access-block-configuration (structure)
          The  PublicAccessBlock  configuration  that you want to apply to the
          specified Amazon Web Services account.

          BlockPublicAcls -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public  access  control
              lists  (ACLs)  for buckets in this account. Setting this element
              to TRUE causes the following behavior:

              o PUT Bucket acl and PUT Object acl calls fail if the  specified
                ACL is public.

              o PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

              o PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing policies or ACLs.

              This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          IgnorePublicAcls -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for buck-
              ets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE causes  Amazon
              S3  to ignore all public ACLs on buckets in this account and any
              objects that they contain.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect the persistence of any  ex-
              isting ACLs and doesn't prevent new public ACLs from being set.

              This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          BlockPublicPolicy -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket policies
              for buckets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE causes
              Amazon  S3 to reject calls to PUT Bucket policy if the specified
              bucket policy allows public access.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing bucket policies.

              This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          RestrictPublicBuckets -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should restrict public bucket  poli-
              cies  for  buckets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE
              restricts access to buckets with public policies to only  Amazon
              Web Service principals and authorized users within this account.

              Enabling  this  setting  doesn't affect previously stored bucket
              policies, except that public and cross-account access within any
              public  bucket  policy,  including non-public delegation to spe-
              cific accounts, is blocked.

              This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          BlockPublicAcls=boolean,IgnorePublicAcls=boolean,BlockPublicPolicy=boolean,RestrictPublicBuckets=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "BlockPublicAcls": true|false,
            "IgnorePublicAcls": true|false,
            "BlockPublicPolicy": true|false,
            "RestrictPublicBuckets": true|false
          }

       --account-id (string)
          The account ID for the Amazon Web Services account  whose  PublicAc-
          cessBlock configuration you want to set.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              --account-id 123456789012 \
              --public-access-block-configuration '{"BlockPublicAcls": true, "IgnorePublicAcls": true, "BlockPublicPolicy": true, "RestrictPublicBuckets": true}'

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
