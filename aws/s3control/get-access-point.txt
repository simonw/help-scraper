GET-ACCESS-POINT()                                          GET-ACCESS-POINT()



NAME
       get-access-point -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns configuration information about the specified access point.

       All  Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an
       additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the  request
       and  an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control .
       For an example of the request syntax for Amazon  S3  on  Outposts  that
       uses  the  S3  on  Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the x-amz-out-
       post-id derived using the access point ARN, see the Examples section.

       The following actions are related to GetAccessPoint :

       o CreateAccessPoint

       o DeleteAccessPoint

       o ListAccessPoints

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-access-point
          --account-id <value>
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The account ID for the account that owns the specified access point.

       --name (string)
          The name of the access point  whose  configuration  information  you
          want to retrieve.

          For  using  this  parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST
          API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

          For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts  with  the  Amazon  Web
          Services  SDK  and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the access point
          accessed    in    the    format    arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<ac-
          count-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/accesspoint/<my-accesspoint-name>   .
          For example, to access the access point reports-ap  through  outpost
          my-outpost  owned  by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2 , use
          the URL encoding of  arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:out-
          post/my-outpost/accesspoint/reports-ap  .  The value must be URL en-
          coded.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve access point configuration details

       The following get-access-point example retrieves the configuration  de-
       tails  for  the  access point named finance-ap in account 123456789012.
       Before running this example, replace the access point name and  account
       number with appropriate values for your use case.

          aws s3control get-access-point \
              --account-id 123456789012 \
              --name finance-ap

       Output:

          {
              "Name": "finance-ap",
              "Bucket": "business-records",
              "NetworkOrigin": "Internet",
              "PublicAccessBlockConfiguration": {
                  "BlockPublicAcls": false,
                  "IgnorePublicAcls": false,
                  "BlockPublicPolicy": false,
                  "RestrictPublicBuckets": false
              },
              "CreationDate": "2020-01-01T00:00:00Z"
          }

       Points in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       Name -> (string)
          The name of the specified access point.

       Bucket -> (string)
          The name of the bucket associated with the specified access point.

       NetworkOrigin -> (string)
          Indicates whether this access point allows access  from  the  public
          internet.  If  VpcConfiguration  is specified for this access point,
          then NetworkOrigin is VPC , and the access point doesn't  allow  ac-
          cess  from the public internet. Otherwise, NetworkOrigin is Internet
          , and the access point allows access from the public internet,  sub-
          ject to the access point and bucket access policies.

          This will always be true for an Amazon S3 on Outposts access point

       VpcConfiguration -> (structure)
          Contains the virtual private cloud (VPC) configuration for the spec-
          ified access point.

          NOTE:
              This element is empty if this access point is an  Amazon  S3  on
              Outposts access point that is used by other Amazon Web Services.

          VpcId -> (string)
              If  this  field  is specified, this access point will only allow
              connections from the specified VPC ID.

       PublicAccessBlockConfiguration -> (structure)
          The PublicAccessBlock configuration that you want to apply  to  this
          Amazon  S3  account. You can enable the configuration options in any
          combination. For more information about when Amazon S3  considers  a
          bucket  or  object public, see The Meaning of "Public" in the Amazon
          S3 User Guide .

          This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          BlockPublicAcls -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public  access  control
              lists  (ACLs)  for buckets in this account. Setting this element
              to TRUE causes the following behavior:

              o PUT Bucket acl and PUT Object acl calls fail if the  specified
                ACL is public.

              o PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

              o PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing policies or ACLs.

              This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          IgnorePublicAcls -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for buck-
              ets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE causes  Amazon
              S3  to ignore all public ACLs on buckets in this account and any
              objects that they contain.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect the persistence of any  ex-
              isting ACLs and doesn't prevent new public ACLs from being set.

              This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          BlockPublicPolicy -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket policies
              for buckets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE causes
              Amazon  S3 to reject calls to PUT Bucket policy if the specified
              bucket policy allows public access.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing bucket policies.

              This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          RestrictPublicBuckets -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should restrict public bucket  poli-
              cies  for  buckets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE
              restricts access to buckets with public policies to only  Amazon
              Web Service principals and authorized users within this account.

              Enabling  this  setting  doesn't affect previously stored bucket
              policies, except that public and cross-account access within any
              public  bucket  policy,  including non-public delegation to spe-
              cific accounts, is blocked.

              This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       CreationDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time when the specified access point was created.

       Alias -> (string)
          The name or alias of the access point.

       AccessPointArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the access point.

       Endpoints -> (map)
          The VPC endpoint for the access point.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
