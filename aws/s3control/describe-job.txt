       tions job. For more information, see S3 Batch Operations in the  Amazon
       S3 User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-job
          --account-id <value>
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the S3 Batch Op-
          erations job.

       --job-id (string)
          The ID for the job whose information you want to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe an Amazon S3 batch operations job

       The following describe-job provides configuration parameters and status
       for the specified batch operations job.

                 NewObjectMetadata -> (structure)
                     If you don't provide this parameter, Amazon S3 copies all
                     the metadata from the original objects. If you specify an
                     empty  set, the new objects will have no tags. Otherwise,
                     Amazon S3 assigns the supplied tags to the new objects.

                 NewObjectTagging -> (list)
                     (structure)
                        Key -> (string)

                        Value -> (string)

                 RedirectLocation -> (string)
                     Specifies an optional metadata property for website redi-
                     rects,  x-amz-website-redirect-location  . Allows webpage
                     redirects if the object is  accessed  through  a  website

                     Specifies the folder prefix into which you would like the
                     objects to be copied. For example, to copy objects into a
                     folder named "Folder1" in the destination bucket, set the
                     TargetKeyPrefix to "Folder1/".

                 ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus -> (string)
                     The legal hold status to be applied to all objects in the

                     The date when the applied object retention  configuration

                 BucketKeyEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key
                     for object encryption with server-side  encryption  using
                     Amazon Web Services KMS (SSE-KMS). Setting this header to
                     true causes Amazon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key for  object
                     encryption with SSE-KMS.

                     Specifying  this  header with an object action doesnt af-
                     fect bucket-level settings for S3 Bucket Key.

              S3PutObjectAcl -> (structure)
                 Directs the specified job to run a PUT Object acl call on ev-

                            ID -> (string)

                            DisplayName -> (string)

                        Grants -> (list)
                            (structure)
                               Grantee -> (structure)
                                   TypeIdentifier -> (string)

                                   Identifier -> (string)

                                   DisplayName -> (string)

                               Permission -> (string)

                     CannedAccessControlList -> (string)

              S3PutObjectTagging -> (structure)
                 Directs the specified job to run a PUT Object tagging call on
                 every object in the manifest.

                 TagSet -> (list)
                     (structure)
                        Key -> (string)

                        Value -> (string)

              S3DeleteObjectTagging -> (structure)
                 Directs the specified job to execute a DELETE Object  tagging
                 call on every object in the manifest.

              S3InitiateRestoreObject -> (structure)
                 Directs  the  specified  job to initiate restore requests for
                 every archived object in the manifest.

                 ExpirationInDays -> (integer)
                     This argument specifies how long the  S3  Glacier  or  S3
                     Glacier  Deep  Archive object remains available in Amazon
                     S3. S3  Initiate  Restore  Object  jobs  that  target  S3
                     Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep Archive objects require Expi-
                     rationInDays set to 1 or greater.

                     Conversely, do not set ExpirationInDays when creating  S3
                     Initiate  Restore  Object  jobs  that  target S3 Intelli-
                     gent-Tiering Archive Access and Deep Archive Access  tier
                     objects. Objects in S3 Intelligent-Tiering archive access
                     tiers are not subject to restore  expiry,  so  specifying
                     ExpirationInDays results in restore request failure.

                     S3 Batch Operations jobs can operate either on S3 Glacier
                     and S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class objects  or  on
                     S3  Intelligent-Tiering  Archive  Access and Deep Archive
                     Access storage tier objects, but not both  types  in  the
                     same  job.  If  you need to restore objects of both types
                     you must create separate Batch Operations jobs.

                 GlacierJobTier -> (string)
                     S3 Batch Operations supports STANDARD and BULK  retrieval
                     tiers, but not the EXPEDITED retrieval tier.

              S3PutObjectLegalHold -> (structure)
                 Contains  the  configuration for an S3 Object Lock legal hold
                 operation that an S3 Batch Operations job passes every object
                 to  the  underlying PutObjectLegalHold API. For more informa-
                 tion, see Using S3 Object Lock legal hold with S3 Batch Oper-
                 ations in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                 LegalHold -> (structure)
                     Contains  the Object Lock legal hold status to be applied
                     to all objects in the Batch Operations job.

                     Status -> (string)
                        The Object Lock legal hold status to be applied to all
                        objects in the Batch Operations job.

              S3PutObjectRetention -> (structure)
                 Contains the configuration parameters for the Object Lock re-
                 tention action for an S3 Batch Operations job.  Batch  Opera-
                 tions  passes  every object to the underlying PutObjectReten-
                 tion API. For more information, see Using S3 Object Lock  re-
                 tention  with S3 Batch Operations in the Amazon S3 User Guide
                 .

                 BypassGovernanceRetention -> (boolean)
