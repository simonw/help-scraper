LIST-ACCESS-POINTS()                                      LIST-ACCESS-POINTS()



NAME
       list-access-points -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of the access points that are owned by the current ac-
       count that's associated with the specified bucket. You can retrieve  up
       to  1000  access points per call. If the specified bucket has more than
       1,000 access points (or the number specified in maxResults ,  whichever
       is  less),  the response will include a continuation token that you can
       use to list the additional access points.

       All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require  an
       additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request.
       In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts  endpoint  hostname  prefix
       instead of s3-control . For an example of the request syntax for Amazon
       S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts  endpoint  hostname  prefix
       and the x-amz-outpost-id derived by using the access point ARN, see the
       Examples section.

       The following actions are related to ListAccessPoints :

       o CreateAccessPoint

       o DeleteAccessPoint

       o GetAccessPoint

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID for the  account  that  owns  the
          specified access points.

       --bucket (string)
          The  name  of  the bucket whose associated access points you want to
          list.

          For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts  with  the  REST
          API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

          For  using  this  parameter  with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web
          Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN  of  the  bucket  ac-
          cessed  in the format arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:out-
          post/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name> . For example,  to  access
          the  bucket  reports  through  Outpost  my-outpost  owned by account
          123456789012  in  Region  us-west-2  ,  use  the  URL  encoding   of
          arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-out-
          post/bucket/reports . The value must be URL encoded.

       --next-token (string)
          A continuation token. If a previous  call  to  ListAccessPoints  re-
          turned  a  continuation token in the NextToken field, then providing
          that value here causes Amazon S3 to retrieve the next  page  of  re-
          sults.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of access points that you want to include in the
          list. If the specified bucket has more than this  number  of  access
          points,  then  the response will include a continuation token in the
          NextToken field that you can use to retrieve the next page of access
          points.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following list-access-points example retrieves a list of all access
       points   attached   to   the  bucket  external-docs  owned  by  account
       123456789012.

          aws s3control list-access-points \
              --account-id 123456789012 \
              --bucket external-docs

       Output:

          {
              "AccessPointList": [
                  {
                      "Name": "customer-ap",
                      "NetworkOrigin": "Internet",
                      "Bucket": "external-docs"
                  },
                  {
                      "Name": "public-ap",
                      "NetworkOrigin": "Internet",
                      "Bucket": "external-docs"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       AccessPointList -> (list)
          Contains  identification  and  configuration  information for one or
          more access points associated with the specified bucket.

          (structure)
              An access point used to access a bucket.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of this access point.

              NetworkOrigin -> (string)
                 Indicates whether this access point allows  access  from  the
                 public  internet.  If  VpcConfiguration is specified for this
                 access point, then NetworkOrigin is  VPC  ,  and  the  access
                 point  doesn't  allow access from the public internet. Other-
                 wise, NetworkOrigin is Internet , and the access point allows
                 access  from the public internet, subject to the access point
                 and bucket access policies.

              VpcConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The virtual private cloud (VPC) configuration for this access
                 point, if one exists.

                 NOTE:
                     This  element  is empty if this access point is an Amazon
                     S3 on Outposts access point that is used by other  Amazon
                     Web Services.

                 VpcId -> (string)
                     If  this  field is specified, this access point will only
                     allow connections from the specified VPC ID.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The name of the bucket associated with this access point.

              AccessPointArn -> (string)
                 The ARN for the access point.

              Alias -> (string)
                 The name or alias of the access point.

              BucketAccountId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account ID  associated  with  the  S3
                 bucket associated with this access point.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the specified bucket has more access points than can be returned
          in one call to this API, this field contains  a  continuation  token
          that you can provide in subsequent calls to this API to retrieve ad-
          ditional access points.
