       NOTE:

          S3 bucket tags, see GetBucketTagging in the Amazon S3 API  Reference
          .

       .

       To  use this action, you must have permission to perform the GetBucket-
       Tagging action. By default, the bucket owner has  this  permission  and
       can grant this permission to others.

         o Description: There is no tag set associated with the bucket.

       All  Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an
       additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the  request
       and  an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control .
       For an example of the request syntax for Amazon  S3  on  Outposts  that
       uses  the  S3  on  Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the x-amz-out-
       post-id derived using the access point ARN, see the Examples section.

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-tagging
          --account-id <value>
          --bucket <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID of the Outposts bucket.

       --bucket (string)
          Specifies the bucket.

          For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts  with  the  REST
          API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

          For  using  this  parameter  with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web
          Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN  of  the  bucket  ac-
          cessed  in the format arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:out-
          post/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name> . For example,  to  access
          the  bucket  reports  through  outpost  my-outpost  owned by account
          123456789012  in  Region  us-west-2  ,  use  the  URL  encoding   of
          arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-out-
          post/bucket/reports . The value must be URL encoded.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
