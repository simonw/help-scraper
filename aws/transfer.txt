DESCRIPTION
       Amazon Web Services Transfer Family is a fully managed service that en-
       ables the transfer of files over the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), File
       Transfer  Protocol over SSL (FTPS), or Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer
       Protocol (SFTP) directly into and out of Amazon Simple Storage  Service
       (Amazon S3). Amazon Web Services helps you seamlessly migrate your file
       transfer workflows to Amazon Web Services Transfer Family by  integrat-
       ing  with  existing  authentication  systems, and providing DNS routing
       with Amazon Route 53 so nothing changes for your  customers  and  part-
       ners,  or  their applications. With your data in Amazon S3, you can use
       it with Amazon Web Services services for processing, analytics, machine
       learning,  and  archiving.  Getting  started  with  Amazon Web Services
       Transfer Family is easy since there is no infrastructure to buy and set
       up.
