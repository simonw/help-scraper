OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the build project.

          NOTE:
              You cannot change a build project's name.

       --description (string)
          A new or replacement description of the build project.

       --source (structure)
          Information  to be changed about the build input source code for the
          build project.

          type -> (string)
              The type of repository that  contains  the  source  code  to  be
              built. Valid values include:

              o BITBUCKET : The source code is in a Bitbucket repository.

              o CODECOMMIT : The source code is in an CodeCommit repository.

              o CODEPIPELINE  :  The source code settings are specified in the
                source action of a pipeline in CodePipeline.

              o GITHUB : The source code is in a GitHub repository.

              o GITHUB_ENTERPRISE : The source code is in a GitHub  Enterprise
                Server repository.

              o GITLAB : The source code is in a GitLab repository.

              o GITLAB_SELF_MANAGED  :  The  source  code is in a self-managed
                GitLab repository.

              o NO_SOURCE : The project does not have input source code.

              o S3 : The source code is in an Amazon S3 bucket.

          location -> (string)
              Information about the location of the source code to  be  built.
              Valid values include:

              o For  source code settings that are specified in the source ac-
                tion of a pipeline in CodePipeline,  location  should  not  be
                specified.  If  it is specified, CodePipeline ignores it. This
                is because CodePipeline uses  the  settings  in  a  pipeline's
                source action instead of this value.

              o For  source  code in an CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS clone
                URL to the repository that contains the source  code  and  the
                buildspec   file   (for  example,  https://git-codecommit.<re-
                gion-ID>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/<repo-name> ).

              o For source code in an Amazon S3 input bucket, one of the  fol-
                lowing.

                o The  path to the ZIP file that contains the source code (for
                  example, <bucket-name>/<path>/<object-name>.zip ).

                o The path to the folder that contains the  source  code  (for
                  example, <bucket-name>/<path-to-source-code>/<folder>/ ).

              o For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to
                the repository that contains  the  source  and  the  buildspec
                file.  You  must  connect  your Amazon Web Services account to
                your GitHub account. Use the CodeBuild console to start creat-
                ing  a  build project. When you use the console to connect (or
                reconnect) with GitHub, on the  GitHub  Authorize  application
                page,  for Organization access , choose Request access next to
                each repository you want to allow CodeBuild to have access to,
                and  then  choose Authorize application . (After you have con-
                nected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish  cre-
                ating the build project. You can leave the CodeBuild console.)
                To instruct CodeBuild to use this connection,  in  the  source
                object, set the auth object's type value to OAUTH .

              o For  source  code  in an GitLab or self-managed GitLab reposi-
                tory, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains  the
                source  and  the  buildspec file. You must connect your Amazon
                Web Services account to your GitLab account. Use the CodeBuild
                console  to  start  creating a build project. When you use the
                console to connect (or reconnect) with GitLab, on the  Connec-
                tions  Authorize  application page, choose Authorize . Then on
                the CodeStar Connections Create GitLab connection page, choose
                Connect  to  GitLab . (After you have connected to your GitLab
                account, you do not need to finish creating the build project.
                You can leave the CodeBuild console.) To instruct CodeBuild to
                override the default connection and use  this  connection  in-
                stead,  set the auth object's type value to CODECONNECTIONS in
                the source object.

              o For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL
                to  the  repository that contains the source and the buildspec
                file. You must connect your Amazon  Web  Services  account  to
                your  Bitbucket  account.  Use  the CodeBuild console to start
                creating a build project. When you use the console to  connect
                (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket Confirm access
                to your account page, choose Grant access .  (After  you  have
                connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish
                creating the build project. You can leave the  CodeBuild  con-
                sole.)  To  instruct  CodeBuild to use this connection, in the
                source object, set the auth object's type value to OAUTH .

              If you specify CODEPIPELINE for the Type property, don't specify
              this  property. For all of the other types, you must specify Lo-
              cation .

          gitCloneDepth -> (integer)
              Information about the Git clone depth for the build project.

          gitSubmodulesConfig -> (structure)
              Information about the Git submodules configuration for the build
              project.

              fetchSubmodules -> (boolean)
                 Set  to true to fetch Git submodules for your CodeBuild build
                 project.

          buildspec -> (string)
              The buildspec file declaration to use for  the  builds  in  this
              build project.

              If this value is set, it can be either an inline buildspec defi-
              nition, the path to an alternate buildspec file relative to  the
              value of the built-in CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR environment variable, or
              the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in the same  Amazon
              Web  Services Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec
              file using its ARN (for example,  arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sam-
              ple2/buildspec.yml ). If this value is not provided or is set to
              an empty string, the source code must contain a  buildspec  file
              in  its root directory. For more information, see Buildspec File
              Name and Storage Location .

          auth -> (structure)
              Information about the authorization settings  for  CodeBuild  to
              access the source code to be built.

              This  information  is for the CodeBuild console's use only. Your
              code should not get or set this information directly.

              type -> (string)
                 The authorization type to use. Valid  options  are  OAUTH  or
                 CODECONNECTIONS.

              resource -> (string)
                 The  resource  value that applies to the specified authoriza-
                 tion type.

          reportBuildStatus -> (boolean)
              Set to true to report the status of a build's start  and  finish
              to  your  source  provider.  This option is valid only when your
              source provider is GitHub,  GitHub  Enterprise,  GitLab,  GitLab
              Self Managed, or Bitbucket. If this is set and you use a differ-
              ent source provider, an invalidInputException is thrown.

              To be able to report the build status to  the  source  provider,
              the user associated with the source provider must have write ac-
              cess to the repo. If the user does not have  write  access,  the
              build status cannot be updated. For more information, see Source
              provider access in the CodeBuild User Guide .

              The status of a build triggered by a webhook is always  reported
              to your source provider.

              If  your  project's  builds are triggered by a webhook, you must
              push a new commit to the repo for a change to this  property  to
              take effect.

          buildStatusConfig -> (structure)
              Contains  information that defines how the build project reports
              the build status to the source provider.  This  option  is  only
              used when the source provider is GITHUB , GITHUB_ENTERPRISE , or
              BITBUCKET .

              context -> (string)
                 Specifies the context of the build status CodeBuild sends  to
                 the  source  provider. The usage of this parameter depends on
                 the source provider.
                     Bitbucket

                 This parameter is used for the name  parameter  in  the  Bit-
                 bucket  commit status. For more information, see build in the
                 Bitbucket API documentation.
                     GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server

                 This parameter is used  for  the  context  parameter  in  the
                 GitHub commit status. For more information, see Create a com-
                 mit status in the GitHub developer guide.

              targetUrl -> (string)
                 Specifies the target url of the build status CodeBuild  sends
                 to  the  source provider. The usage of this parameter depends
                 on the source provider.
                     Bitbucket

                 This parameter is used for the url parameter in the Bitbucket
                 commit  status.  For  more information, see build in the Bit-
                 bucket API documentation.
                     GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server

                 This parameter is used for the target_url  parameter  in  the
                 GitHub commit status. For more information, see Create a com-
                 mit status in the GitHub developer guide.

          insecureSsl -> (boolean)
              Enable this flag to ignore SSL warnings while connecting to  the
              project source code.

          sourceIdentifier -> (string)
              An  identifier  for this project source. The identifier can only
              contain alphanumeric characters and  underscores,  and  must  be
              less than 128 characters in length.

       --secondary-sources (list)
          An array of ProjectSource objects.

          (structure)
              Information  about  the  build  input  source code for the build
              project.

              type -> (string)
                 The type of repository that contains the source  code  to  be
                 built. Valid values include:

                 o BITBUCKET : The source code is in a Bitbucket repository.

                 o CODECOMMIT  :  The  source code is in an CodeCommit reposi-
                   tory.

                 o CODEPIPELINE : The source code settings  are  specified  in
                   the source action of a pipeline in CodePipeline.

                 o GITHUB : The source code is in a GitHub repository.

                 o GITHUB_ENTERPRISE  :  The source code is in a GitHub Enter-
                   prise Server repository.

                 o GITLAB : The source code is in a GitLab repository.

                 o GITLAB_SELF_MANAGED : The source code is in a  self-managed
                   GitLab repository.

                 o NO_SOURCE : The project does not have input source code.

                 o S3 : The source code is in an Amazon S3 bucket.

              location -> (string)
                 Information  about  the  location  of  the  source code to be
                 built. Valid values include:

                 o For source code settings that are specified in  the  source
                   action  of  a pipeline in CodePipeline, location should not
                   be specified. If it is specified, CodePipeline ignores  it.
                   This  is  because CodePipeline uses the settings in a pipe-
                   line's source action instead of this value.

                 o For source code in  an  CodeCommit  repository,  the  HTTPS
                   clone  URL  to the repository that contains the source code
                   and the buildspec file (for  example,  https://git-codecom-
                   mit.<region-ID>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/<repo-name> ).

                 o For  source  code  in an Amazon S3 input bucket, one of the
                   following.

                   o The path to the ZIP file that contains  the  source  code
                     (for example, <bucket-name>/<path>/<object-name>.zip ).

                   o The path to the folder that contains the source code (for
                     example, <bucket-name>/<path-to-source-code>/<folder>/ ).

                 o For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL
                   to  the  repository that contains the source and the build-
                   spec file. You must connect your Amazon  Web  Services  ac-
                   count  to your GitHub account. Use the CodeBuild console to
                   start creating a build project. When you use the console to
                   connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub Authorize
                   application page, for Organization access , choose  Request
                   access  next to each repository you want to allow CodeBuild
                   to have access to, and then choose Authorize application  .
                   (After  you  have  connected to your GitHub account, you do
                   not need to finish creating  the  build  project.  You  can
                   leave  the CodeBuild console.) To instruct CodeBuild to use
                   this connection, in the source object,  set  the  auth  ob-
                   ject's type value to OAUTH .

                 o For source code in an GitLab or self-managed GitLab reposi-
                   tory, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository  that  contains
                   the  source  and  the buildspec file. You must connect your
                   Amazon Web Services account to your GitLab account. Use the
                   CodeBuild  console  to start creating a build project. When
                   you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with  GitLab,
                   on  the  Connections Authorize application page, choose Au-
                   thorize . Then on the CodeStar  Connections  Create  GitLab
                   connection page, choose Connect to GitLab . (After you have
                   connected to your GitLab account, you do not need to finish
                   creating  the  build  project.  You can leave the CodeBuild
                   console.) To instruct CodeBuild  to  override  the  default
                   connection  and  use  this connection instead, set the auth
                   object's type value to CODECONNECTIONS in  the  source  ob-
                   ject.

                 o For  source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone
                   URL to the repository that  contains  the  source  and  the
                   buildspec  file.  You must connect your Amazon Web Services
                   account to your Bitbucket account. Use the  CodeBuild  con-
                   sole  to  start  creating a build project. When you use the
                   console to connect (or reconnect) with  Bitbucket,  on  the
                   Bitbucket Confirm access to your account page, choose Grant
                   access . (After you have connected to  your  Bitbucket  ac-
                   count,  you  do  not  need  to  finish  creating  the build
                   project. You can leave the CodeBuild console.) To  instruct
                   CodeBuild to use this connection, in the source object, set
                   the auth object's type value to OAUTH .

                 If you specify CODEPIPELINE  for  the  Type  property,  don't
                 specify  this  property. For all of the other types, you must
                 specify Location .

              gitCloneDepth -> (integer)
                 Information about the Git clone depth for the build project.

              gitSubmodulesConfig -> (structure)
                 Information about the Git submodules  configuration  for  the
                 build project.

                 fetchSubmodules -> (boolean)
                     Set  to  true  to fetch Git submodules for your CodeBuild
                     build project.

              buildspec -> (string)
                 The buildspec file declaration to use for the builds in  this
                 build project.

                 If  this  value  is set, it can be either an inline buildspec
                 definition, the path to an alternate buildspec file  relative
                 to  the  value  of the built-in CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR environment
                 variable, or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be  in
                 the  same  Amazon  Web  Services Region as the build project.
                 Specify the  buildspec  file  using  its  ARN  (for  example,
                 arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml  ).  If  this
                 value is not provided or is  set  to  an  empty  string,  the
                 source  code must contain a buildspec file in its root direc-
                 tory. For more information, see Buildspec File Name and Stor-
                 age Location .

              auth -> (structure)
                 Information about the authorization settings for CodeBuild to
                 access the source code to be built.

                 This information is for the  CodeBuild  console's  use  only.
                 Your code should not get or set this information directly.

                 type -> (string)
                     The authorization type to use. Valid options are OAUTH or
                     CODECONNECTIONS.

                 resource -> (string)
                     The resource value that applies to the  specified  autho-
                     rization type.

              reportBuildStatus -> (boolean)
                 Set  to true to report the status of a build's start and fin-
                 ish to your source provider. This option is valid  only  when
                 your  source  provider  is GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab,
                 GitLab Self Managed, or Bitbucket. If this is set and you use
                 a  different  source  provider,  an  invalidInputException is
                 thrown.

                 To be able to report the build status to the source provider,
                 the  user associated with the source provider must have write
                 access to the repo. If the user does not have  write  access,
                 the build status cannot be updated. For more information, see
                 Source provider access in the CodeBuild User Guide .

                 The status of a build triggered by a webhook  is  always  re-
                 ported to your source provider.

                 If your project's builds are triggered by a webhook, you must
                 push a new commit to the repo for a change to  this  property
                 to take effect.

              buildStatusConfig -> (structure)
                 Contains  information  that defines how the build project re-
                 ports the build status to the source provider. This option is
                 only  used when the source provider is GITHUB , GITHUB_ENTER-
                 PRISE , or BITBUCKET .

                 context -> (string)
                     Specifies the context of the build status CodeBuild sends
                     to  the  source provider. The usage of this parameter de-
                     pends on the source provider.
                        Bitbucket

                     This parameter is used for the name parameter in the Bit-
                     bucket  commit status. For more information, see build in
                     the Bitbucket API documentation.
                        GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server

                     This parameter is used for the context parameter  in  the
                     GitHub  commit status. For more information, see Create a
                     commit status in the GitHub developer guide.

                 targetUrl -> (string)
                     Specifies the target url of the  build  status  CodeBuild
                     sends to the source provider. The usage of this parameter
                     depends on the source provider.
                        Bitbucket

                     This parameter is used for the url parameter in the  Bit-
                     bucket  commit status. For more information, see build in
                     the Bitbucket API documentation.
                        GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server

                     This parameter is used for the  target_url  parameter  in
                     the  GitHub  commit  status.  For  more  information, see
                     Create a commit status in the GitHub developer guide.

              insecureSsl -> (boolean)
                 Enable this flag to ignore SSL warnings while  connecting  to
                 the project source code.

              sourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 An  identifier  for  this  project source. The identifier can
                 only contain alphanumeric  characters  and  underscores,  and
                 must be less than 128 characters in length.

       --source-version (string)
          A  version  of  the build input to be built for this project. If not
          specified, the latest version is used. If specified, it must be  one
          of:

          o For CodeCommit: the commit ID, branch, or Git tag to use.

          o For  GitHub:  the  commit ID, pull request ID, branch name, or tag
            name that corresponds to the version of the source code  you  want
            to  build. If a pull request ID is specified, it must use the for-
            mat pr/pull-request-ID (for example pr/25 ). If a branch  name  is
            specified,  the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified,
            the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

          o For Bitbucket: the commit ID, branch name, or tag name that corre-
            sponds  to  the version of the source code you want to build. If a
            branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used.  If
            not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

          o For  Amazon  S3:  the version ID of the object that represents the
            build input ZIP file to use.

          If sourceVersion is specified at the build level, then that  version
          takes precedence over this sourceVersion (at the project level).

          For  more  information,  see Source Version Sample with CodeBuild in
          the CodeBuild User Guide .

       --secondary-source-versions (list)
          An array of ProjectSourceVersion objects. If secondarySourceVersions
          is  specified  at  the  build  level, then they take over these sec-
          ondarySourceVersions (at the project level).

          (structure)
              A source identifier and its corresponding version.

              sourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 An identifier for a source in the build project. The  identi-
                 fier  can  only  contain  alphanumeric  characters and under-
                 scores, and must be less than 128 characters in length.

              sourceVersion -> (string)
                 The source version for the corresponding  source  identifier.
                 If specified, must be one of:

                 o For CodeCommit: the commit ID, branch, or Git tag to use.

                 o For  GitHub  or  GitLab:  the  commit  ID, pull request ID,
                   branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of
                   the  source code you want to build. If a pull request ID is
                   specified, it must use the format  pr/pull-request-ID  (for
                   example,  pr/25  ).  If  a  branch  name  is specified, the
                   branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the  de-
                   fault branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

                 o For Bitbucket: the commit ID, branch name, or tag name that
                   corresponds to the version of the source code you  want  to
                   build.  If  a  branch  name is specified, the branch's HEAD
                   commit ID is used. If not specified, the  default  branch's
                   HEAD commit ID is used.

                 o For Amazon S3: the version ID of the object that represents
                   the build input ZIP file to use.

                 For more information, see Source Version  Sample  with  Code-
                 Build in the CodeBuild User Guide .

       --artifacts (structure)
          Information  to  be changed about the build output artifacts for the
          build project.

          type -> (string)
              The type of build output artifact. Valid values include:

              o CODEPIPELINE : The build project has  build  output  generated
                through CodePipeline.

              NOTE:
                 The CODEPIPELINE type is not supported for secondaryArtifacts
                 .

              o NO_ARTIFACTS : The build project does not  produce  any  build
                output.

              o S3 : The build project stores build output in Amazon S3.

          location -> (string)
              Information about the build output artifact location:

              o If  type  is  set  to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores this
                value if specified. This is because CodePipeline  manages  its
                build output locations instead of CodeBuild.

              o If  type  is  set  to  NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored if
                specified, because no build output is produced.

              o If type is set to S3 , this is the name of the output bucket.

          path -> (string)
              Along with namespaceType and name , the pattern  that  CodeBuild
              uses to name and store the output artifact:

              o If  type  is  set  to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores this
                value if specified. This is because CodePipeline  manages  its
                build output names instead of CodeBuild.

              o If  type  is  set  to  NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored if
                specified, because no build output is produced.

              o If type is set to S3 , this is the path to  the  output  arti-
                fact. If path is not specified, path is not used.

              For  example,  if  path is set to MyArtifacts , namespaceType is
              set to NONE , and name is set to MyArtifact.zip , the output ar-
              tifact  is  stored  in  the output bucket at MyArtifacts/MyArti-
              fact.zip .

          namespaceType -> (string)
              Along with path and name , the pattern that  CodeBuild  uses  to
              determine the name and location to store the output artifact:

              o If  type  is  set  to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores this
                value if specified. This is because CodePipeline  manages  its
                build output names instead of CodeBuild.

              o If  type  is  set  to  NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored if
                specified, because no build output is produced.

              o If type is set to S3 , valid values include:

                o BUILD_ID : Include the build ID in the location of the build
                  output artifact.

                o NONE  :  Do not include the build ID. This is the default if
                  namespaceType is not specified.

              For example, if path is set to MyArtifacts  ,  namespaceType  is
              set to BUILD_ID , and name is set to MyArtifact.zip , the output
              artifact is stored in MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip .

          name -> (string)
              Along with path and namespaceType , the pattern  that  CodeBuild
              uses to name and store the output artifact:

              o If  type  is  set  to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores this
                value if specified. This is because CodePipeline  manages  its
                build output names instead of CodeBuild.

              o If  type  is  set  to  NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored if
                specified, because no build output is produced.

              o If type is set to S3 , this is the name of the output artifact
                object.  If  you set the name to be a forward slash ("/"), the
                artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket.

              For example:

              o If path is set  to  MyArtifacts  ,  namespaceType  is  set  to
                BUILD_ID , and name is set to MyArtifact.zip , then the output
                artifact is stored in MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip .

              o If path is empty, namespaceType is set to NONE , and  name  is
                set  to "/ ", the output artifact is stored in the root of the
                output bucket.

              o If path is set  to  MyArtifacts  ,  namespaceType  is  set  to
                BUILD_ID  ,  and  name  is set to "/ ", the output artifact is
                stored in MyArtifacts/<build-ID> .

          packaging -> (string)
              The type of build output artifact to create:

              o If type is set to CODEPIPELINE  ,  CodePipeline  ignores  this
                value  if  specified. This is because CodePipeline manages its
                build output artifacts instead of CodeBuild.

              o If type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS ,  this  value  is  ignored  if
                specified, because no build output is produced.

              o If type is set to S3 , valid values include:

                o NONE  : CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a folder that
                  contains the build output. This is the default if  packaging
                  is not specified.

                o ZIP : CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a ZIP file that
                  contains the build output.

          overrideArtifactName -> (boolean)
              If this flag is set, a name  specified  in  the  buildspec  file
              overrides  the  artifact name. The name specified in a buildspec
              file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Command Lan-
              guage. For example, you can append a date and time to your arti-
              fact name so that it is always unique.

          encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
              Set to true if you do not want your output artifacts  encrypted.
              This  option  is valid only if your artifacts type is Amazon S3.
              If this is set with another artifacts type,  an  invalidInputEx-
              ception is thrown.

          artifactIdentifier -> (string)
              An identifier for this artifact definition.

          bucketOwnerAccess -> (string)
              Specifies the bucket owner's access for objects that another ac-
              count uploads to their Amazon S3 bucket. By  default,  only  the
              account  that  uploads  the  objects to the bucket has access to
              these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket owner
              access to these objects.

              NOTE:
                 To  use  this property, your CodeBuild service role must have
                 the s3:PutBucketAcl permission. This permission allows  Code-
                 Build to modify the access control list for the bucket.

              This property can be one of the following values:
                 NONE

              The  bucket  owner  does not have access to the objects. This is
              the default.
                 READ_ONLY

              The bucket owner has read-only access to the  objects.  The  up-
              loading account retains ownership of the objects.
                 FULL

              The  bucket  owner has full access to the objects. Object owner-
              ship is determined by the following criteria:

              o If the bucket is configured with the  Bucket  owner  preferred
                setting,  the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading ac-
                count will have object access as  specified  by  the  bucket's
                policy.

              o Otherwise,  the uploading account retains ownership of the ob-
                jects.

       --secondary-artifacts (list)
          An array of ProjectArtifact objects.

          (structure)
              Information about the  build  output  artifacts  for  the  build
              project.

              type -> (string)
                 The type of build output artifact. Valid values include:

                 o CODEPIPELINE : The build project has build output generated
                   through CodePipeline.

                 NOTE:
                     The CODEPIPELINE type is not supported for secondaryArti-
                     facts .

                 o NO_ARTIFACTS : The build project does not produce any build
                   output.

                 o S3 : The build project stores build output in Amazon S3.

              location -> (string)
                 Information about the build output artifact location:

                 o If type is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores  this
                   value  if  specified.  This is because CodePipeline manages
                   its build output locations instead of CodeBuild.

                 o If type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is  ignored  if
                   specified, because no build output is produced.

                 o If  type  is  set  to  S3  , this is the name of the output
                   bucket.

              path -> (string)
                 Along with namespaceType and name , the  pattern  that  Code-
                 Build uses to name and store the output artifact:

                 o If  type is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores this
                   value if specified. This is  because  CodePipeline  manages
                   its build output names instead of CodeBuild.

                 o If  type  is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored if
                   specified, because no build output is produced.

                 o If type is set to S3 , this is the path to the output arti-
                   fact. If path is not specified, path is not used.

                 For example, if path is set to MyArtifacts , namespaceType is
                 set to NONE , and name is set to MyArtifact.zip , the  output
                 artifact   is   stored   in  the  output  bucket  at  MyArti-
                 facts/MyArtifact.zip .

              namespaceType -> (string)
                 Along with path and name , the pattern that CodeBuild uses to
                 determine the name and location to store the output artifact:

                 o If  type is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores this
                   value if specified. This is  because  CodePipeline  manages
                   its build output names instead of CodeBuild.

                 o If  type  is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored if
                   specified, because no build output is produced.

                 o If type is set to S3 , valid values include:

                   o BUILD_ID : Include the build ID in the  location  of  the
                     build output artifact.

                   o NONE  :  Do not include the build ID. This is the default
                     if namespaceType is not specified.

                 For example, if path is set to MyArtifacts , namespaceType is
                 set  to  BUILD_ID  ,  and name is set to MyArtifact.zip , the
                 output artifact is stored  in  MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArti-
                 fact.zip .

              name -> (string)
                 Along  with  path  and namespaceType , the pattern that Code-
                 Build uses to name and store the output artifact:

                 o If type is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores  this
                   value  if  specified.  This is because CodePipeline manages
                   its build output names instead of CodeBuild.

                 o If type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is  ignored  if
                   specified, because no build output is produced.

                 o If type is set to S3 , this is the name of the output arti-
                   fact object. If you set the name  to  be  a  forward  slash
                   ("/"),  the  artifact  is  stored in the root of the output
                   bucket.

                 For example:

                 o If path is set to MyArtifacts ,  namespaceType  is  set  to
                   BUILD_ID  ,  and  name  is set to MyArtifact.zip , then the
                   output artifact is stored in MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArti-
                   fact.zip .

                 o If  path  is empty, namespaceType is set to NONE , and name
                   is set to "/ ", the output artifact is stored in  the  root
                   of the output bucket.

                 o If  path  is  set  to MyArtifacts , namespaceType is set to
                   BUILD_ID , and name is set to "/ ", the output artifact  is
                   stored in MyArtifacts/<build-ID> .

              packaging -> (string)
                 The type of build output artifact to create:

                 o If  type is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores this
                   value if specified. This is  because  CodePipeline  manages
                   its build output artifacts instead of CodeBuild.

                 o If  type  is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored if
                   specified, because no build output is produced.

                 o If type is set to S3 , valid values include:

                   o NONE : CodeBuild creates in the output  bucket  a  folder
                     that  contains  the  build output. This is the default if
                     packaging is not specified.

                   o ZIP : CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a  ZIP  file
                     that contains the build output.

              overrideArtifactName -> (boolean)
                 If  this  flag is set, a name specified in the buildspec file
                 overrides the artifact name. The name specified in  a  build-
                 spec file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Com-
                 mand Language. For example, you can append a date and time to
                 your artifact name so that it is always unique.

              encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                 Set  to  true  if  you  do not want your output artifacts en-
                 crypted. This option is valid only if your artifacts type  is
                 Amazon S3. If this is set with another artifacts type, an in-
                 validInputException is thrown.

              artifactIdentifier -> (string)
                 An identifier for this artifact definition.

              bucketOwnerAccess -> (string)
                 Specifies the bucket owner's access for objects that  another
                 account  uploads  to their Amazon S3 bucket. By default, only
                 the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access
                 to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket
                 owner access to these objects.

                 NOTE:
                     To use this property, your CodeBuild  service  role  must
                     have  the s3:PutBucketAcl permission. This permission al-
                     lows CodeBuild to modify the access control list for  the
                     bucket.

                 This property can be one of the following values:
                     NONE

                 The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is
                 the default.
                     READ_ONLY

                 The bucket owner has read-only access to the objects. The up-
                 loading account retains ownership of the objects.
                     FULL

                 The  bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object own-
                 ership is determined by the following criteria:

                 o If the bucket is configured with the Bucket owner preferred
                   setting,  the  bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading
                   account  will  have  object  access  as  specified  by  the
                   bucket's policy.

                 o Otherwise,  the  uploading account retains ownership of the
                   objects.

       --cache (structure)
          Stores recently used information so that it can be quickly  accessed
          at a later time.

          type -> (string)
              The  type  of  cache used by the build project. Valid values in-
              clude:

              o NO_CACHE : The build project does not use any cache.

              o S3 : The build project reads and writes from and to S3.

              o LOCAL : The build project stores a cache locally  on  a  build
                host that is only available to that build host.

          location -> (string)
              Information about the cache location:

              o NO_CACHE or LOCAL : This value is ignored.

              o S3 : This is the S3 bucket name/prefix.

          modes -> (list)
              An  array of strings that specify the local cache modes. You can
              use one or more local cache modes at the same time. This is only
              used for LOCAL cache types.

              Possible values are:
                 LOCAL_SOURCE_CACHE

              Caches Git metadata for primary and secondary sources. After the
              cache is created, subsequent builds pull only the change between
              commits.  This  mode  is a good choice for projects with a clean
              working directory and a source that is a large  Git  repository.
              If  you  choose  this option and your project does not use a Git
              repository (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket), the option
              is ignored.
                 LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE

              Caches  existing  Docker  layers. This mode is a good choice for
              projects that build or pull large Docker images. It can  prevent
              the  performance  issues  caused  by pulling large Docker images
              down from the network.

              NOTE:

                 o You can use a Docker layer cache in the  Linux  environment
                   only.

                 o The  privileged  flag  must be set so that your project has
                   the required Docker permissions.

                 o You should consider the security  implications  before  you
                   use a Docker layer cache.

                 LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE

              Caches  directories you specify in the buildspec file. This mode
              is a good choice if your build scenario is not suited to one  of
              the other three local cache modes. If you use a custom cache:

              o Only  directories  can  be  specified  for caching. You cannot
                specify individual files.

              o Symlinks are used to reference cached directories.

              o Cached directories are linked to your build  before  it  down-
                loads  its  project  sources. Cached items are overridden if a
                source item has the same name. Directories are specified using
                cache paths in the buildspec file.

          image -> (string)
              The  image  tag or image digest that identifies the Docker image
              to use for this build project. Use the following formats:

              o For an image tag: <registry>/<repository>:<tag> . For example,
                in  the  Docker  repository  that CodeBuild uses to manage its
                Docker images, this would be aws/codebuild/standard:4.0 .

              o For an image digest:  <registry>/<repository>@<digest>  .  For
                example,    to    specify    an    image   with   the   digest

              NOTE:
                 If  you're using compute fleets during project creation, com-
                 puteType will be ignored.

              For more information, see Build Environment Compute Types in the
              CodeBuild User Guide.

          fleet -> (structure)
              A ProjectFleet object to use for this build project.

              fleetArn -> (string)
                 Specifies the compute fleet ARN for the build project.

          environmentVariables -> (list)
              A  set  of environment variables to make available to builds for
              this build project.

              (structure)
                 Information about an environment variable for a build project
                 or a build.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name or key of the environment variable.

                 value -> (string)
                     The value of the environment variable.

                     WARNING:
                        We  strongly  discourage the use of PLAINTEXT environ-
                        ment variables to store sensitive  values,  especially
                        Amazon Web Services secret key IDs. PLAINTEXT environ-
                        ment variables can be displayed in  plain  text  using
                        the  CodeBuild console and the CLI. For sensitive val-
                        ues, we recommend you use an environment  variable  of
                        type PARAMETER_STORE or SECRETS_MANAGER .

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of environment variable. Valid values include:

                     o PARAMETER_STORE  :  An  environment  variable stored in
                       Systems Manager Parameter Store. For environment  vari-
                       ables  of  this type, specify the name of the parameter
                       as the value of the EnvironmentVariable. The  parameter
                       value  will be substituted for the name at runtime. You
                       can also define Parameter Store  environment  variables
                       in   the   buildspec.  To  learn  how  to  do  so,  see
                       env/parameter-store in the CodeBuild User Guide .

                     o PLAINTEXT : An environment variable in plain text  for-
                       mat. This is the default value.

                     o SECRETS_MANAGER : An environment variable stored in Se-
                       crets Manager. For environment variables of this  type,
                       specify  the name of the secret as the value of the En-
                       vironmentVariable. The secret value will be substituted
                       for  the  name  at runtime. You can also define Secrets
                       Manager environment  variables  in  the  buildspec.  To
                       learn  how  to  do  so,  see env/secrets-manager in the
                       CodeBuild User Guide .

          privilegedMode -> (boolean)
              Enables running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container. Set
              to  true  only  if the build project is used to build Docker im-
              ages. Otherwise, a build that  attempts  to  interact  with  the
              Docker daemon fails. The default setting is false .

              You can initialize the Docker daemon during the install phase of
              your build by adding one of the following sets  of  commands  to
              the install phase of your buildspec file:

              If the operating system's base image is Ubuntu Linux:
                 -                 nohup                /usr/local/bin/dockerd
                 --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock  --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375
                 --storage-driver=overlay&

                 -  timeout  15  sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1;
                 done"

              If the operating system's base image is  Alpine  Linux  and  the
              previous command does not work, add the -t argument to timeout :
                 -                 nohup                /usr/local/bin/dockerd
                 --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock  --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375
                 --storage-driver=overlay&

                 - timeout -t 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1;
                 done"

          certificate -> (string)
              The ARN of the Amazon S3 bucket, path  prefix,  and  object  key
              that contains the PEM-encoded certificate for the build project.
              For more information, see  certificate  in  the  CodeBuild  User
              Guide .

          registryCredential -> (structure)
              The credentials for access to a private registry.

              credential -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or name of credentials created
                 using Secrets Manager.

                 NOTE:
                     The credential can use the name of the  credentials  only
                     if they exist in your current Amazon Web Services Region.

              credentialProvider -> (string)
                 The  service that created the credentials to access a private
                 Docker registry. The valid value, SECRETS_MANAGER, is for Se-
                 crets Manager.

          imagePullCredentialsType -> (string)
              The  type  of  credentials CodeBuild uses to pull images in your
              build. There are two valid values:

              o CODEBUILD specifies that CodeBuild uses its  own  credentials.
                This  requires  that  you modify your ECR repository policy to
                trust CodeBuild service principal.

              o SERVICE_ROLE  specifies  that  CodeBuild   uses   your   build
                project's service role.

              When you use a cross-account or private registry image, you must
              use SERVICE_ROLE credentials. When you use an CodeBuild  curated
              image, you must use CODEBUILD credentials.

              artifacts if your service role has permission to that key.

          You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK or,
          if  available,  the CMK's alias (using the format alias/<alias-name>
          ).

       --tags (list)
          An updated list of tag key and  value  pairs  associated  with  this
          build project.

          s3Logs -> (structure)
              Information about logs  built  to  an  S3  bucket  for  a  build
              project. S3 logs are not enabled by default.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status of the S3 build logs. Valid values are:

                 o ENABLED : S3 build logs are enabled for this build project.

                 o DISABLED  :  S3  build  logs are not enabled for this build
                   project.

              location -> (string)
                 The ARN of an S3 bucket and the path prefix for S3  logs.  If
                 your  Amazon S3 bucket name is my-bucket , and your path pre-
                 fix   is   build-log   ,   then   acceptable   formats    are
                 my-bucket/build-log or arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/build-log .

              encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                 Set  to  true if you do not want your S3 build log output en-
                 crypted. By default S3 build logs are encrypted.

              bucketOwnerAccess -> (string)
                 Specifies the bucket owner's access for objects that  another
                 account  uploads  to their Amazon S3 bucket. By default, only
                 the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access
                 to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket
                 owner access to these objects.

                 NOTE:
                     To use this property, your CodeBuild  service  role  must
                     have  the s3:PutBucketAcl permission. This permission al-
                     lows CodeBuild to modify the access control list for  the
                     bucket.

                 This property can be one of the following values:
                     NONE

                 The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is
                 the default.
                     READ_ONLY

                 The bucket owner has read-only access to the objects. The up-
                 loading account retains ownership of the objects.
                     FULL

                 The  bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object own-
                 ership is determined by the following criteria:

                 o If the bucket is configured with the Bucket owner preferred
                   setting,  the  bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading
                   account  will  have  object  access  as  specified  by  the
                   bucket's policy.

                 o Otherwise,  the  uploading account retains ownership of the
                   objects.

                 For more information about Amazon S3  object  ownership,  see

       --file-system-locations (list)
          An array of ProjectFileSystemLocation objects for a CodeBuild  build
          project. A ProjectFileSystemLocation object specifies the identifier
          , location , mountOptions , mountPoint , and type of a  file  system
          created using Amazon Elastic File System.

          (structure)
              Information  about  a file system created by Amazon Elastic File
              System (EFS). For more information, see What Is  Amazon  Elastic
              File System?

              type -> (string)
                 The type of the file system. The one supported type is EFS .

              location -> (string)
                 A  string that specifies the location of the file system cre-
                 ated  by  Amazon  EFS.  Its  format  is  efs-dns-name:/direc-
                 tory-path . You can find the DNS name of file system when you
                 view it in the Amazon EFS console. The directory  path  is  a
                 path to a directory in the file system that CodeBuild mounts.
                 For  example,  if  the  DNS  name  of  a   file   system   is
                 fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com  ,  and its mount di-
                 rectory is my-efs-mount-directory  ,  then  the  location  is
                 fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:/my-efs-mount-direc-
                 tory .

                 The directory path in the format efs-dns-name:/directory-path
                 is  optional. If you do not specify a directory path, the lo-
                 cation is only the DNS name and CodeBuild mounts  the  entire
                 file system.

              mountPoint -> (string)
                 The  location  in the container where you mount the file sys-
                 tem.

              identifier -> (string)
                 The name used to access a file system created by Amazon  EFS.
                 CodeBuild  creates  an  environment variable by appending the
                 identifier in all capital letters to CODEBUILD_ .  For  exam-
                 ple, if you specify my_efs for identifier , a new environment
                 variable is create named CODEBUILD_MY_EFS .

                 The identifier is used to mount your file system.

              mountOptions -> (string)
                 The mount options for a file system created  by  Amazon  EFS.
                 The   default   mount   options   used   by   CodeBuild   are
                 nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,re-
                 trans=2 . For more information, see Recommended NFS Mount Op-
                 tions .

              Specifies the service role ARN for the batch build project.

          combineArtifacts -> (boolean)
              Specifies if the build artifacts for the batch build  should  be
              combined into a single artifact location.

          restrictions -> (structure)
              A  BatchRestrictions  object that specifies the restrictions for
              the batch build.

              maximumBuildsAllowed -> (integer)
                 Specifies the maximum number of builds allowed.

              computeTypesAllowed -> (list)
                 An array of strings that specify the compute types  that  are
                 allowed  for  the  batch build. See Build environment compute
                 types in the CodeBuild User Guide for these values.

                 (string)

          timeoutInMins -> (integer)
              Specifies the maximum amount of time, in minutes, that the batch
              build must be completed in.

          batchReportMode -> (string)
              Specifies  how  build  status  reports  are  sent  to the source
              provider for the batch build. This property is  only  used  when
              the  source  provider  for your project is Bitbucket, GitHub, or
              GitHub Enterprise, and your  project  is  configured  to  report
              build statuses to the source provider.
                 REPORT_AGGREGATED_BATCH

              (Default) Aggregate all of the build statuses into a single sta-
              tus report.
                 REPORT_INDIVIDUAL_BUILDS

              Send a separate status report for each individual build.

       Shorthand Syntax:

       --concurrent-build-limit (integer)
          The maximum number of concurrent builds that are  allowed  for  this
          project.

          New  builds are only started if the current number of builds is less
          than or equal to this limit. If the current build count  meets  this
          limit, new builds are throttled and are not run.

          To remove this limit, set this value to -1.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To change an AWS CodeBuild build project's settings.

       The following update-project example changes the settings of the speci-
       fied CodeBuild build project named my-demo-project.

          aws codebuild update-project --name "my-demo-project" \
              --description "This project is updated" \
              --source "{\"type\": \"S3\",\"location\": \"codebuild-us-west-2-123456789012-input-bucket/my-source-2.zip\"}" \
              --artifacts {"\"type\": \"S3\",\"location\": \"codebuild-us-west-2-123456789012-output-bucket-2\""} \

              The name of the build project.

          arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the build project.

          description -> (string)
              A description that makes the build project easy to identify.

          source -> (structure)
              Information  about  the  build  input source code for this build
              project.

              type -> (string)
                 The type of repository that contains the source  code  to  be
                 built. Valid values include:

                 o BITBUCKET : The source code is in a Bitbucket repository.

                 o CODECOMMIT  :  The  source code is in an CodeCommit reposi-
                   tory.

                 o CODEPIPELINE : The source code settings  are  specified  in
                   the source action of a pipeline in CodePipeline.

                 o GITHUB : The source code is in a GitHub repository.

                 o GITHUB_ENTERPRISE  :  The source code is in a GitHub Enter-
                   prise Server repository.

                 o GITLAB : The source code is in a GitLab repository.

                 o GITLAB_SELF_MANAGED : The source code is in a  self-managed
                   GitLab repository.

                 o NO_SOURCE : The project does not have input source code.

                 o S3 : The source code is in an Amazon S3 bucket.

              location -> (string)
                 Information  about  the  location  of  the  source code to be
                 built. Valid values include:

                 o For source code settings that are specified in  the  source
                   action  of  a pipeline in CodePipeline, location should not
                   be specified. If it is specified, CodePipeline ignores  it.
                   This  is  because CodePipeline uses the settings in a pipe-
                   line's source action instead of this value.

                 o For source code in  an  CodeCommit  repository,  the  HTTPS
                   clone  URL  to the repository that contains the source code
                   and the buildspec file (for  example,  https://git-codecom-
                   mit.<region-ID>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/<repo-name> ).

                 o For  source  code  in an Amazon S3 input bucket, one of the
                   following.

                   o The path to the ZIP file that contains  the  source  code
                     (for example, <bucket-name>/<path>/<object-name>.zip ).

                   o The path to the folder that contains the source code (for
                     example, <bucket-name>/<path-to-source-code>/<folder>/ ).

                 o For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL
                   to  the  repository that contains the source and the build-
                   spec file. You must connect your Amazon  Web  Services  ac-
                   count  to your GitHub account. Use the CodeBuild console to
                   start creating a build project. When you use the console to
                   connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub Authorize
                   application page, for Organization access , choose  Request
                   access  next to each repository you want to allow CodeBuild
                   to have access to, and then choose Authorize application  .
                   (After  you  have  connected to your GitHub account, you do
                   not need to finish creating  the  build  project.  You  can
                   leave  the CodeBuild console.) To instruct CodeBuild to use
                   this connection, in the source object,  set  the  auth  ob-
                   ject's type value to OAUTH .

                 o For source code in an GitLab or self-managed GitLab reposi-
                   tory, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository  that  contains
                   the  source  and  the buildspec file. You must connect your
                   Amazon Web Services account to your GitLab account. Use the
                   CodeBuild  console  to start creating a build project. When
                   you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with  GitLab,
                   on  the  Connections Authorize application page, choose Au-
                   thorize . Then on the CodeStar  Connections  Create  GitLab
                   connection page, choose Connect to GitLab . (After you have
                   connected to your GitLab account, you do not need to finish
                   creating  the  build  project.  You can leave the CodeBuild
                   console.) To instruct CodeBuild  to  override  the  default
                   connection  and  use  this connection instead, set the auth
                   object's type value to CODECONNECTIONS in  the  source  ob-
                   ject.

                 o For  source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone
                   URL to the repository that  contains  the  source  and  the
                   buildspec  file.  You must connect your Amazon Web Services
                   account to your Bitbucket account. Use the  CodeBuild  con-
                   sole  to  start  creating a build project. When you use the
                   console to connect (or reconnect) with  Bitbucket,  on  the
                   Bitbucket Confirm access to your account page, choose Grant
                   access . (After you have connected to  your  Bitbucket  ac-
                   count,  you  do  not  need  to  finish  creating  the build
                   project. You can leave the CodeBuild console.) To  instruct
                   CodeBuild to use this connection, in the source object, set
                   the auth object's type value to OAUTH .

                 If you specify CODEPIPELINE  for  the  Type  property,  don't
                 specify  this  property. For all of the other types, you must
                 specify Location .

              gitCloneDepth -> (integer)
                 Information about the Git clone depth for the build project.

              gitSubmodulesConfig -> (structure)
                 Information about the Git submodules  configuration  for  the
                 build project.

                 fetchSubmodules -> (boolean)
                     Set  to  true  to fetch Git submodules for your CodeBuild
                     build project.

              buildspec -> (string)
                 The buildspec file declaration to use for the builds in  this
                 build project.

                 If  this  value  is set, it can be either an inline buildspec
                 definition, the path to an alternate buildspec file  relative
                 to  the  value  of the built-in CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR environment
                 variable, or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be  in
                 the  same  Amazon  Web  Services Region as the build project.
                 Specify the  buildspec  file  using  its  ARN  (for  example,
                 arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml  ).  If  this
                 value is not provided or is  set  to  an  empty  string,  the
                 source  code must contain a buildspec file in its root direc-
                 tory. For more information, see Buildspec File Name and Stor-
                 age Location .

              auth -> (structure)
                 Information about the authorization settings for CodeBuild to
                 access the source code to be built.

                 This information is for the  CodeBuild  console's  use  only.
                 Your code should not get or set this information directly.

                 type -> (string)
                     The authorization type to use. Valid options are OAUTH or
                     CODECONNECTIONS.

                 resource -> (string)
                     The resource value that applies to the  specified  autho-
                     rization type.

              reportBuildStatus -> (boolean)
                 Set  to true to report the status of a build's start and fin-
                 ish to your source provider. This option is valid  only  when
                 your  source  provider  is GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab,
                 GitLab Self Managed, or Bitbucket. If this is set and you use
                 a  different  source  provider,  an  invalidInputException is
                 thrown.

                 To be able to report the build status to the source provider,
                 the  user associated with the source provider must have write
                 access to the repo. If the user does not have  write  access,
                 the build status cannot be updated. For more information, see
                 Source provider access in the CodeBuild User Guide .

                 The status of a build triggered by a webhook  is  always  re-
                 ported to your source provider.

                 If your project's builds are triggered by a webhook, you must
                 push a new commit to the repo for a change to  this  property
                 to take effect.

              buildStatusConfig -> (structure)
                 Contains  information  that defines how the build project re-
                 ports the build status to the source provider. This option is
                 only  used when the source provider is GITHUB , GITHUB_ENTER-
                 PRISE , or BITBUCKET .

                 context -> (string)
                     Specifies the context of the build status CodeBuild sends
                     to  the  source provider. The usage of this parameter de-
                     pends on the source provider.
                        Bitbucket

                     This parameter is used for the name parameter in the Bit-
                     bucket  commit status. For more information, see build in
                     the Bitbucket API documentation.
                        GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server

                     This parameter is used for the context parameter  in  the
                     GitHub  commit status. For more information, see Create a
                     commit status in the GitHub developer guide.

                 targetUrl -> (string)
                     Specifies the target url of the  build  status  CodeBuild
                     sends to the source provider. The usage of this parameter
                     depends on the source provider.
                        Bitbucket

                     This parameter is used for the url parameter in the  Bit-
                     bucket  commit status. For more information, see build in
                     the Bitbucket API documentation.
                        GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server

                     This parameter is used for the  target_url  parameter  in
                     the  GitHub  commit  status.  For  more  information, see

              An array of ProjectSource objects.

              (structure)
                 Information  about  the build input source code for the build
                 project.

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of repository that contains the source  code  to
                     be built. Valid values include:

                     o BITBUCKET  :  The source code is in a Bitbucket reposi-
                       tory.

                     o CODECOMMIT : The source code is in an CodeCommit repos-
                       itory.

                     o CODEPIPELINE  :  The source code settings are specified
                       in the source action of a pipeline in CodePipeline.

                     o GITHUB : The source code is in a GitHub repository.

                     o GITHUB_ENTERPRISE : The source code is in a GitHub  En-
                       terprise Server repository.

                     o GITLAB : The source code is in a GitLab repository.

                     o GITLAB_SELF_MANAGED : The source code is in a self-man-
                       aged GitLab repository.

                     o NO_SOURCE : The project  does  not  have  input  source
                       code.

                     o S3 : The source code is in an Amazon S3 bucket.

                 location -> (string)
                     Information  about  the location of the source code to be
                     built. Valid values include:

                     o For source code settings  that  are  specified  in  the
                       source  action  of a pipeline in CodePipeline, location
                       should not be specified.  If  it  is  specified,  Code-
                       Pipeline  ignores it. This is because CodePipeline uses
                       the settings in a pipeline's source action  instead  of
                       this value.

                     o For  source code in an CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS
                       clone URL to the repository that  contains  the  source
                       code    and    the   buildspec   file   (for   example,
                       https://git-codecommit.<region-ID>.amazonaws.com/v1/re-
                       pos/<repo-name> ).

                     o For  source  code  in an Amazon S3 input bucket, one of
                       the following.

                       o The path to the ZIP file  that  contains  the  source
                         code    (for    example,    <bucket-name>/<path>/<ob-
                         ject-name>.zip ).

                       o The path to the folder that contains the source  code
                         (for                                         example,
                         <bucket-name>/<path-to-source-code>/<folder>/ ).

                     o For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone
                       URL  to the repository that contains the source and the
                       buildspec file. You must connect your Amazon  Web  Ser-
                       vices account to your GitHub account. Use the CodeBuild
                       console to start creating a build project. When you use
                       the  console  to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on
                       the GitHub Authorize application page, for Organization
                       access  , choose Request access next to each repository
                       you want to allow CodeBuild to have access to, and then
                       choose  Authorize  application  .  (After you have con-
                       nected to your GitHub account, you do not need to  fin-
                       ish creating the build project. You can leave the Code-
                       Build console.) To instruct CodeBuild to use this  con-
                       nection,  in  the  source object, set the auth object's
                       type value to OAUTH .

                     o For source code in an  GitLab  or  self-managed  GitLab
                       repository,  the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that
                       contains the source and the buildspec  file.  You  must
                       connect your Amazon Web Services account to your GitLab
                       account. Use the CodeBuild console to start creating  a
                       build  project. When you use the console to connect (or
                       reconnect) with GitLab, on  the  Connections  Authorize
                       application  page,  choose  Authorize  .  Then  on  the
                       CodeStar Connections  Create  GitLab  connection  page,
                       choose Connect to GitLab . (After you have connected to
                       your GitLab account, you do not need to finish creating
                       the  build  project.  You  can leave the CodeBuild con-
                       sole.) To instruct CodeBuild to  override  the  default
                       connection  and  use  this  connection instead, set the
                       auth object's type  value  to  CODECONNECTIONS  in  the
                       source object.

                     o For  source  code  in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS
                       clone URL to the repository that  contains  the  source
                       and  the  buildspec  file. You must connect your Amazon
                       Web Services account to your Bitbucket account. Use the
                       CodeBuild  console  to  start creating a build project.
                       When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with
                       Bitbucket,  on the Bitbucket Confirm access to your ac-
                       count page, choose Grant access . (After you have  con-
                       nected  to  your  Bitbucket account, you do not need to
                       finish creating the build project. You  can  leave  the
                       CodeBuild  console.)  To instruct CodeBuild to use this
                       connection, in the source object, set the auth object's
                       type value to OAUTH .

                     If  you specify CODEPIPELINE for the Type property, don't
                     specify this property. For all of the  other  types,  you
                     must specify Location .

                 gitCloneDepth -> (integer)
                     Information  about  the  Git  clone  depth  for the build
                     project.

                 gitSubmodulesConfig -> (structure)
                     Information about the Git  submodules  configuration  for
                     the build project.

                     fetchSubmodules -> (boolean)
                        Set to true to fetch Git submodules for your CodeBuild
                        build project.

                 buildspec -> (string)
                     The buildspec file declaration to use for the  builds  in
                     this build project.

                     If  this  value is set, it can be either an inline build-
                     spec definition, the path to an alternate buildspec  file
                     relative  to  the value of the built-in CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR
                     environment variable, or the path to an  S3  bucket.  The
                     bucket  must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region as
                     the build project. Specify the buildspec file  using  its
                     ARN    (for    example,    arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sam-
                     ple2/buildspec.yml ). If this value is not provided or is
                     set  to  an  empty string, the source code must contain a
                     buildspec file in its root directory. For  more  informa-
                     tion, see Buildspec File Name and Storage Location .

                 auth -> (structure)
                     Information  about  the  authorization settings for Code-
                     Build to access the source code to be built.

                     This information is for the CodeBuild console's use only.
                     Your  code  should  not  get  or set this information di-
                     rectly.

                     type -> (string)
                        The authorization type to use. Valid options are OAUTH
                        or CODECONNECTIONS.

                     resource -> (string)
                        The  resource  value that applies to the specified au-
                        thorization type.

                 reportBuildStatus -> (boolean)
                     Set to true to report the status of a build's  start  and
                     finish to your source provider. This option is valid only
                     when your source provider is GitHub,  GitHub  Enterprise,
                     GitLab, GitLab Self Managed, or Bitbucket. If this is set
                     and you use a different source provider, an  invalidInpu-
                     tException is thrown.

                     To  be  able  to  report  the  build status to the source
                     provider, the user associated with  the  source  provider
                     must  have write access to the repo. If the user does not
                     have write access, the build status  cannot  be  updated.
                     For  more  information, see Source provider access in the
                     CodeBuild User Guide .

                     The status of a build triggered by a  webhook  is  always
                     reported to your source provider.

                     If  your project's builds are triggered by a webhook, you
                     must push a new commit to the repo for a change  to  this
                     property to take effect.

                 buildStatusConfig -> (structure)
                     Contains  information  that defines how the build project
                     reports the build status to the source provider. This op-
                     tion  is  only  used when the source provider is GITHUB ,
                     GITHUB_ENTERPRISE , or BITBUCKET .

                     context -> (string)

                        sends to the source provider. The usage of this param-
                        eter depends on the source provider.
                            Bitbucket

                        This parameter is used for the name parameter  in  the
                        Bitbucket  commit  status.  For  more information, see
                        build in the Bitbucket API documentation.
                            GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server

                     targetUrl -> (string)
                        Specifies the target url of the build status CodeBuild
                        sends to the source provider. The usage of this param-
                        eter depends on the source provider.
                            Bitbucket

                        This parameter is used for the url  parameter  in  the
                        Bitbucket  commit  status.  For  more information, see
                        build in the Bitbucket API documentation.
                            GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server

                        This parameter is used for the target_url parameter in
                        the  GitHub  commit  status. For more information, see

                 insecureSsl -> (boolean)
                     Enable this flag to ignore SSL warnings while  connecting
                     to the project source code.

                 sourceIdentifier -> (string)
                     An identifier for this project source. The identifier can
                     only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores, and
                     must be less than 128 characters in length.

          sourceVersion -> (string)
              A  version  of  the build input to be built for this project. If
              not specified, the latest version is used. If specified, it must
              be one of:

              o For CodeCommit: the commit ID, branch, or Git tag to use.

              o For  GitHub:  the  commit ID, pull request ID, branch name, or
                tag name that corresponds to the version of  the  source  code
                you  want to build. If a pull request ID is specified, it must
                use the format pr/pull-request-ID (for example pr/25 ).  If  a
                branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used.
                If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

              o For Bitbucket: the commit ID, branch name, or  tag  name  that
                corresponds  to  the  version  of  the source code you want to
                build. If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit
                ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit
                ID is used.

              o For Amazon S3: the version ID of the  object  that  represents
                the build input ZIP file to use.

              If sourceVersion is specified at the build level, then that ver-
              sion takes precedence over this sourceVersion  (at  the  project
              level).

              For  more  information, see Source Version Sample with CodeBuild
              in the CodeBuild User Guide .

          secondarySourceVersions -> (list)
              An array of ProjectSourceVersion objects. If secondarySourceVer-
              sions is specified at the build level, then they take over these
              secondarySourceVersions (at the project level).

              (structure)
                 A source identifier and its corresponding version.

                 sourceIdentifier -> (string)
                     An identifier for a source  in  the  build  project.  The
                     identifier  can  only contain alphanumeric characters and
                     underscores, and must be  less  than  128  characters  in
                     length.

                 sourceVersion -> (string)
                     The  source  version for the corresponding source identi-
                     fier. If specified, must be one of:

                     o For CodeCommit: the commit ID, branch, or  Git  tag  to
                       use.

                     o For  GitHub  or GitLab: the commit ID, pull request ID,
                       branch name, or tag name that corresponds to  the  ver-
                       sion  of  the  source code you want to build. If a pull
                       request  ID  is  specified,  it  must  use  the  format
                       pr/pull-request-ID  (for  example, pr/25 ). If a branch
                       name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used.
                       If  not  specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID
                       is used.

                     o For Bitbucket: the commit ID, branch name, or tag  name
                       that  corresponds to the version of the source code you
                       want to build. If  a  branch  name  is  specified,  the
                       branch's  HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the
                       default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

                     o For Amazon S3: the version ID of the object that repre-
                       sents the build input ZIP file to use.

                     For  more  information,  see  Source  Version Sample with
                     CodeBuild in the CodeBuild User Guide .

          artifacts -> (structure)
              Information about the  build  output  artifacts  for  the  build
              project.

              type -> (string)
                 The type of build output artifact. Valid values include:

                 o CODEPIPELINE : The build project has build output generated
                   through CodePipeline.

                 NOTE:
                     The CODEPIPELINE type is not supported for secondaryArti-
                     facts .

                 o NO_ARTIFACTS : The build project does not produce any build
                   output.

                 o S3 : The build project stores build output in Amazon S3.

              location -> (string)
                 Information about the build output artifact location:

                 o If type is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores  this
                   value  if  specified.  This is because CodePipeline manages
                   its build output locations instead of CodeBuild.

                 o If type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is  ignored  if
                   specified, because no build output is produced.

                 o If  type  is  set  to  S3  , this is the name of the output
                   bucket.

              path -> (string)
                 Along with namespaceType and name , the  pattern  that  Code-
                 Build uses to name and store the output artifact:

                 o If  type is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores this
                   value if specified. This is  because  CodePipeline  manages
                   its build output names instead of CodeBuild.

                 o If  type  is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored if
                   specified, because no build output is produced.

                 o If type is set to S3 , this is the path to the output arti-
                   fact. If path is not specified, path is not used.

                 For example, if path is set to MyArtifacts , namespaceType is
                 set to NONE , and name is set to MyArtifact.zip , the  output
                 artifact   is   stored   in  the  output  bucket  at  MyArti-
                 facts/MyArtifact.zip .

              namespaceType -> (string)
                 Along with path and name , the pattern that CodeBuild uses to
                 determine the name and location to store the output artifact:

                 o If  type is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores this
                   value if specified. This is  because  CodePipeline  manages
                   its build output names instead of CodeBuild.

                 o If  type  is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored if
                   specified, because no build output is produced.

                 o If type is set to S3 , valid values include:

                   o BUILD_ID : Include the build ID in the  location  of  the
                     build output artifact.

                   o NONE  :  Do not include the build ID. This is the default
                     if namespaceType is not specified.

                 For example, if path is set to MyArtifacts , namespaceType is
                 set  to  BUILD_ID  ,  and name is set to MyArtifact.zip , the
                 output artifact is stored  in  MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArti-
                 fact.zip .

              name -> (string)
                 Along  with  path  and namespaceType , the pattern that Code-
                 Build uses to name and store the output artifact:

                 o If type is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores  this
                   value  if  specified.  This is because CodePipeline manages
                   its build output names instead of CodeBuild.

                 o If type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is  ignored  if
                   specified, because no build output is produced.

                 o If type is set to S3 , this is the name of the output arti-
                   fact object. If you set the name  to  be  a  forward  slash
                   ("/"),  the  artifact  is  stored in the root of the output
                   bucket.

                 For example:

                 o If path is set to MyArtifacts ,  namespaceType  is  set  to
                   BUILD_ID  ,  and  name  is set to MyArtifact.zip , then the
                   output artifact is stored in MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArti-
                   fact.zip .

                 o If  path  is empty, namespaceType is set to NONE , and name
                   is set to "/ ", the output artifact is stored in  the  root
                   of the output bucket.

                 o If  path  is  set  to MyArtifacts , namespaceType is set to
                   BUILD_ID , and name is set to "/ ", the output artifact  is
                   stored in MyArtifacts/<build-ID> .

              packaging -> (string)
                 The type of build output artifact to create:

                 o If  type is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores this
                   value if specified. This is  because  CodePipeline  manages
                   its build output artifacts instead of CodeBuild.

                 o If  type  is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored if
                   specified, because no build output is produced.

                 o If type is set to S3 , valid values include:

                   o NONE : CodeBuild creates in the output  bucket  a  folder
                     that  contains  the  build output. This is the default if
                     packaging is not specified.

                   o ZIP : CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a  ZIP  file
                     that contains the build output.

              overrideArtifactName -> (boolean)
                 If  this  flag is set, a name specified in the buildspec file
                 overrides the artifact name. The name specified in  a  build-
                 spec file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Com-
                 mand Language. For example, you can append a date and time to
                 your artifact name so that it is always unique.

              encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                 Set  to  true  if  you  do not want your output artifacts en-
                 crypted. This option is valid only if your artifacts type  is
                 Amazon S3. If this is set with another artifacts type, an in-
                 validInputException is thrown.

              artifactIdentifier -> (string)
                 An identifier for this artifact definition.

              bucketOwnerAccess -> (string)
                 Specifies the bucket owner's access for objects that  another
                 account  uploads  to their Amazon S3 bucket. By default, only
                 the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access
                 to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket
                 owner access to these objects.

                 NOTE:
                     To use this property, your CodeBuild  service  role  must
                     have  the s3:PutBucketAcl permission. This permission al-
                     lows CodeBuild to modify the access control list for  the
                     bucket.

                 This property can be one of the following values:
                     NONE

                 The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is
                 the default.
                     READ_ONLY

                 The bucket owner has read-only access to the objects. The up-
                 loading account retains ownership of the objects.
                     FULL

                 The  bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object own-
                 ership is determined by the following criteria:

                 o If the bucket is configured with the Bucket owner preferred
                   setting,  the  bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading
                   account  will  have  object  access  as  specified  by  the
                   bucket's policy.

                 o Otherwise,  the  uploading account retains ownership of the
                   objects.

                 For more information about Amazon S3  object  ownership,  see
                 Controlling  ownership  of  uploaded  objects using S3 Object
                 Ownership in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide .

          secondaryArtifacts -> (list)
              An array of ProjectArtifacts objects.

              (structure)
                 Information about the build output artifacts  for  the  build
                 project.

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of build output artifact. Valid values include:

                     o CODEPIPELINE  : The build project has build output gen-
                       erated through CodePipeline.

                     NOTE:
                        The CODEPIPELINE type is not supported  for  secondar-
                        yArtifacts .

                     o NO_ARTIFACTS  :  The build project does not produce any
                       build output.

                     o S3 : The build project stores build  output  in  Amazon
                       S3.

                 location -> (string)
                     Information about the build output artifact location:

                     o If  type  is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores
                       this value if specified. This is  because  CodePipeline
                       manages  its  build  output  locations instead of Code-
                       Build.

                     o If type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is  ignored
                       if specified, because no build output is produced.

                     o If  type  is set to S3 , this is the name of the output
                       bucket.

                 path -> (string)
                     Along with namespaceType and  name  ,  the  pattern  that
                     CodeBuild uses to name and store the output artifact:

                     o If  type  is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores
                       this value if specified. This is  because  CodePipeline
                       manages its build output names instead of CodeBuild.

                     o If  type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored
                       if specified, because no build output is produced.

                     o If type is set to S3 , this is the path to  the  output
                       artifact. If path is not specified, path is not used.

                     For  example,  if path is set to MyArtifacts , namespace-
                     Type is set to NONE , and name is set to MyArtifact.zip ,
                     the  output  artifact  is  stored in the output bucket at
                     MyArtifacts/MyArtifact.zip .

                 namespaceType -> (string)
                     Along with path and name ,  the  pattern  that  CodeBuild
                     uses to determine the name and location to store the out-
                     put artifact:

                     o If type is set to CODEPIPELINE ,  CodePipeline  ignores
                       this  value  if specified. This is because CodePipeline
                       manages its build output names instead of CodeBuild.

                     o If type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is  ignored
                       if specified, because no build output is produced.

                     o If type is set to S3 , valid values include:

                       o BUILD_ID  :  Include  the build ID in the location of
                         the build output artifact.

                       o NONE : Do not include the build ID. This is  the  de-
                         fault if namespaceType is not specified.

                     For  example,  if path is set to MyArtifacts , namespace-
                     Type is set to BUILD_ID , and  name  is  set  to  MyArti-
                     fact.zip  ,  the  output  artifact  is  stored in MyArti-
                     facts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip .

                 name -> (string)
                     Along with path and  namespaceType  ,  the  pattern  that
                     CodeBuild uses to name and store the output artifact:

                     o If  type  is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores
                       this value if specified. This is  because  CodePipeline
                       manages its build output names instead of CodeBuild.

                     o If  type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored
                       if specified, because no build output is produced.

                     o If type is set to S3 , this is the name of  the  output
                       artifact  object.  If  you set the name to be a forward
                       slash ("/"), the artifact is stored in the root of  the
                       output bucket.

                     For example:

                     o If path is set to MyArtifacts , namespaceType is set to
                       BUILD_ID , and name is set to MyArtifact.zip , then the
                       output     artifact     is     stored     in    MyArti-
                       facts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip .

                     o If path is empty, namespaceType is set to  NONE  ,  and
                       name  is  set to "/ ", the output artifact is stored in
                       the root of the output bucket.

                     o If path is set to MyArtifacts , namespaceType is set to
                       BUILD_ID , and name is set to "/ ", the output artifact
                       is stored in MyArtifacts/<build-ID> .

                 packaging -> (string)
                     The type of build output artifact to create:

                     o If type is set to CODEPIPELINE ,  CodePipeline  ignores
                       this  value  if specified. This is because CodePipeline
                       manages its build output  artifacts  instead  of  Code-
                       Build.

                     o If  type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored
                       if specified, because no build output is produced.

                     o If type is set to S3 , valid values include:

                       o NONE : CodeBuild  creates  in  the  output  bucket  a
                         folder  that  contains  the build output. This is the
                         default if packaging is not specified.

                       o ZIP : CodeBuild creates in the output  bucket  a  ZIP
                         file that contains the build output.

                 overrideArtifactName -> (boolean)
                     If  this  flag  is set, a name specified in the buildspec
                     file overrides the artifact name. The name specified in a
                     buildspec  file  is calculated at build time and uses the
                     Shell Command Language. For example,  you  can  append  a
                     date  and time to your artifact name so that it is always
                     unique.

                 encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                     Set to true if you do not want your output artifacts  en-
                     crypted. This option is valid only if your artifacts type
                     is Amazon S3. If this is set with another artifacts type,
                     an invalidInputException is thrown.

                 artifactIdentifier -> (string)
                     An identifier for this artifact definition.

                 bucketOwnerAccess -> (string)
                     Specifies  the bucket owner's access for objects that an-
                     other account uploads to their Amazon S3 bucket.  By  de-
                     fault,  only  the account that uploads the objects to the
                     bucket has access to these objects. This property  allows
                     you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

                     NOTE:
                        To use this property, your CodeBuild service role must
                        have the s3:PutBucketAcl permission.  This  permission
                        allows CodeBuild to modify the access control list for
                        the bucket.

                     This property can be one of the following values:
                        NONE

                     The bucket owner does not have  access  to  the  objects.
                     This is the default.
                        READ_ONLY

                     The bucket owner has read-only access to the objects. The
                     uploading account retains ownership of the objects.
                        FULL

                     The bucket owner has full access to the  objects.  Object
                     ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                     o If  the bucket is configured with the Bucket owner pre-
                       ferred setting, the bucket owner owns the objects.  The
                       uploading  account will have object access as specified
                       by the bucket's policy.

                     o Otherwise, the uploading account retains  ownership  of
                       the objects.

                     For  more  information  about Amazon S3 object ownership,
                     see Controlling ownership of uploaded  objects  using  S3

                     User Guide .

          cache -> (structure)
              Information about the cache for the build project.

              type -> (string)
                 The type of cache used by the build project. Valid values in-
                 clude:

                 o NO_CACHE : The build project does not use any cache.

                 o S3 : The build project reads and writes from and to S3.

                 o LOCAL : The build project stores a cache locally on a build
                   host that is only available to that build host.

              location -> (string)
                 Information about the cache location:

                 o NO_CACHE or LOCAL : This value is ignored.

                 o S3 : This is the S3 bucket name/prefix.

              modes -> (list)
                 An array of strings that specify the local cache  modes.  You
                 can  use one or more local cache modes at the same time. This
                 is only used for LOCAL cache types.

                 Possible values are:
                     LOCAL_SOURCE_CACHE

                 Caches Git metadata for primary and secondary sources.  After
                 the  cache is created, subsequent builds pull only the change
                 between commits. This mode is a good choice for projects with
                 a  clean  working  directory and a source that is a large Git
                 repository. If you choose this option and your  project  does
                 not  use a Git repository (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bit-
                 bucket), the option is ignored.
                     LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE

                 Caches existing Docker layers. This mode is a good choice for
                 projects  that build or pull large Docker images. It can pre-
                 vent the performance issues caused by  pulling  large  Docker
                 images down from the network.

                 NOTE:

                     o You  can use a Docker layer cache in the Linux environ-
                       ment only.

                     o The privileged flag must be set so  that  your  project
                       has the required Docker permissions.

                     o You  should  consider  the security implications before
                       you use a Docker layer cache.

                     LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE

                 Caches directories you specify in the  buildspec  file.  This
                 mode is a good choice if your build scenario is not suited to
                 one of the other three local cache modes. If you use a custom
                 cache:

                 o Only  directories  can be specified for caching. You cannot
                   specify individual files.

                 o Symlinks are used to reference cached directories.

                 o Cached directories are linked to your build before it down-
                   loads its project sources. Cached items are overridden if a
                   source item has the same name.  Directories  are  specified
                   using cache paths in the buildspec file.

                 (string)

          environment -> (structure)
              Information about the build environment for this build project.

              type -> (string)
                 The type of build environment to use for related builds.

                 NOTE:
                     If you're using compute fleets during  project  creation,
                     type will be ignored.

                 the CodeBuild user guide .

              image -> (string)
                 The image tag or image digest that identifies the Docker  im-
                 age to use for this build project. Use the following formats:

                 o For an image tag: <registry>/<repository>:<tag> . For exam-
                   ple, in the Docker repository that CodeBuild uses to manage
                   its Docker images, this would be aws/codebuild/standard:4.0
                   .

                 o For an image digest: <registry>/<repository>@<digest> . For

                 A  set  of  environment variables to make available to builds
                 for this build project.

                 (structure)
                     Information about an environment  variable  for  a  build
                     project or a build.

                     name -> (string)
                        The name or key of the environment variable.

                     value -> (string)
                        The value of the environment variable.

                        WARNING:
                            We  strongly discourage the use of PLAINTEXT envi-
                            ronment variables to store sensitive values, espe-
                            cially  Amazon Web Services secret key IDs. PLAIN-
                            TEXT environment variables  can  be  displayed  in
                            plain  text  using  the  CodeBuild console and the
                            CLI. For sensitive values, we recommend you use an
                            environment  variable  of  type PARAMETER_STORE or
                            SECRETS_MANAGER .

                     type -> (string)
                        The type of environment  variable.  Valid  values  in-
                        clude:

                        o PARAMETER_STORE  : An environment variable stored in
                          Systems Manager  Parameter  Store.  For  environment
                          variables  of this type, specify the name of the pa-
                          rameter as the value of the EnvironmentVariable. The
                          parameter  value will be substituted for the name at
                          runtime. You can also define Parameter  Store  envi-
                          ronment  variables in the buildspec. To learn how to
                          do so, see env/parameter-store in the CodeBuild User
                          Guide .

                        o PLAINTEXT  :  An  environment variable in plain text
                          format. This is the default value.

                        o SECRETS_MANAGER : An environment variable stored  in
                          Secrets  Manager.  For environment variables of this
                          type, specify the name of the secret as the value of
                          the  EnvironmentVariable.  The  secret value will be
                          substituted for the name at runtime.  You  can  also
                          define  Secrets Manager environment variables in the
                          buildspec.   To   learn   how   to   do   so,    see
                          env/secrets-manager in the CodeBuild User Guide .

              privilegedMode -> (boolean)
                 Enables  running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container.
                 Set to true only if the build project is used to build Docker
                 images. Otherwise, a build that attempts to interact with the
                 Docker daemon fails. The default setting is false .

                 You can initialize the Docker daemon during the install phase
                 of your build by adding one of the following sets of commands
                 to the install phase of your buildspec file:

                 If the operating system's base image is Ubuntu Linux:
                     -              nohup               /usr/local/bin/dockerd
                     --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock
                     --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&

                     - timeout 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo  .;  sleep
                     1; done"

                 If  the operating system's base image is Alpine Linux and the
                 previous command does not work, add the -t argument to  time-
                 out :
                     -               nohup              /usr/local/bin/dockerd
                     --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock
                     --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&

                     -  timeout  -t  15  sh  -c "until docker info; do echo .;
                     sleep 1; done"

              certificate -> (string)
                 The ARN of the Amazon S3 bucket, path prefix, and object  key
                 that  contains  the  PEM-encoded  certificate  for  the build
                 project. For more information, see certificate in  the  Code-
                 Build User Guide .

              registryCredential -> (structure)
                 The credentials for access to a private registry.

                 credential -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) or name of credentials
                     created using Secrets Manager.

                     NOTE:
                        The credential can use the  name  of  the  credentials
                        only if they exist in your current Amazon Web Services
                        Region.

                 credentialProvider -> (string)
                     The service that created the credentials to access a pri-
                     vate  Docker  registry. The valid value, SECRETS_MANAGER,
                     is for Secrets Manager.

              imagePullCredentialsType -> (string)
                 The type of credentials CodeBuild uses to pull images in your
                 build. There are two valid values:

                 o CODEBUILD  specifies  that  CodeBuild  uses its own creden-
                   tials. This requires that you modify  your  ECR  repository
                   policy to trust CodeBuild service principal.

                 o SERVICE_ROLE  specifies  that  CodeBuild  uses  your  build
                   project's service role.

                 When you use a cross-account or private registry  image,  you
                 must  use SERVICE_ROLE credentials. When you use an CodeBuild
                 curated image, you must use CODEBUILD credentials.

          serviceRole -> (string)
              The ARN of the IAM role that enables CodeBuild to interact  with
              dependent  Amazon  Web Services services on behalf of the Amazon
              Web Services account.

          timeoutInMinutes -> (integer)
              How long, in minutes, from 5 to 480 (8 hours), for CodeBuild  to
              wait before timing out any related build that did not get marked
              as completed. The default is 60 minutes.

          queuedTimeoutInMinutes -> (integer)
              The number of minutes a build is allowed to be queued before  it
              times out.

          encryptionKey -> (string)
              The  Key Management Service customer master key (CMK) to be used
              for encrypting the build output artifacts.

              NOTE:
                 You can use a cross-account KMS key to encrypt the build out-
                 put  artifacts  if  your  service role has permission to that
                 key.

              You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK
              or,   if   available,   the   CMK's   alias  (using  the  format
              alias/<alias-name> ). If you don't specify  a  value,  CodeBuild
              uses  the  managed CMK for Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon
              S3).

          tags -> (list)
              A list of tag key and value pairs  associated  with  this  build
              project.

              These tags are available for use by Amazon Web Services services
              that support CodeBuild build project tags.

              (structure)
                 A tag, consisting of a key and a value.

                 This tag is available for use by Amazon Web Services services
                 that support tags in CodeBuild.

                 key -> (string)
                     The tag's key.

                 value -> (string)
                     The tag's value.

          created -> (timestamp)
              When  the build project was created, expressed in Unix time for-
              mat.

          lastModified -> (timestamp)
              When the build project's settings were last modified,  expressed
              in Unix time format.

          webhook -> (structure)
              Information about a webhook that connects repository events to a
              build project in CodeBuild.

              url -> (string)
                 The URL to the webhook.

              payloadUrl -> (string)
                 The CodeBuild endpoint where webhook events are sent.

              secret -> (string)
                 The secret token of the associated repository.

                 NOTE:
                     A Bitbucket webhook does not support secret .

              branchFilter -> (string)
                 A regular  expression  used  to  determine  which  repository
                 branches  are  built when a webhook is triggered. If the name
                 of a branch matches the regular expression, then it is built.
                 If branchFilter is empty, then all branches are built.

                 NOTE:
                     It  is  recommended  that you use filterGroups instead of
                     branchFilter .

              filterGroups -> (list)
                 An array of arrays of WebhookFilter objects used to determine
                 which  webhooks  are triggered. At least one WebhookFilter in
                 the array must specify EVENT as its type .

                 For a build to be triggered, at least one filter group in the
                 filterGroups  array  must  pass.  For a filter group to pass,
                 each of its filters must pass.

                 (list)
                     (structure)
                        A filter used to determine which  webhooks  trigger  a
                        build.

                        type -> (string)
                            The  type  of webhook filter. There are eight web-
                            hook filter  types:  EVENT  ,  ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID  ,
                            HEAD_REF , BASE_REF , FILE_PATH , COMMIT_MESSAGE ,
                            TAG_NAME , and RELEASE_NAME .

                            o EVENT

                              o A webhook event triggers a build when the pro-
                                vided  pattern  matches  one  of  eight  event
                                types: PUSH , PULL_REQUEST_CREATED ,  PULL_RE-
                                QUEST_UPDATED , PULL_REQUEST_CLOSED , PULL_RE-
                                QUEST_REOPENED  ,  PULL_REQUEST_MERGED  ,  RE-
                                LEASED  , and PRERELEASED . The EVENT patterns
                                are specified as a comma-separated string. For
                                example,  PUSH, PULL_REQUEST_CREATED, PULL_RE-
                                QUEST_UPDATED filters all push,  pull  request
                                created, and pull request updated events.

                              NOTE:
                                 The  PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED  works with GitHub
                                 and GitHub Enterprise only. The RELEASED  and
                                 PRERELEASED work with GitHub only.

                            PULL_REQUEST_CREATED, PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED  allows
                            all  push,  pull request created, and pull request
                            updated events to trigger a build.

                            For a WebHookFilter that uses  any  of  the  other
                            filter  types,  a  regular expression pattern. For
                            example, a WebHookFilter that  uses  HEAD_REF  for
                            its  type  and the pattern ^refs/heads/ triggers a
                            build when the head reference is a branch  with  a
                            reference name refs/heads/branch-name .

                        excludeMatchedPattern -> (boolean)

                            webhook events do not trigger a  build.  If  true,
                            then  a webhook event that does not match the pat-
                            tern triggers a build. If false,  then  a  webhook
                            event that matches the pattern triggers a build.

              buildType -> (string)
                 Specifies the type of build this webhook will trigger.

              lastModifiedSecret -> (timestamp)

                     are:

                     o ENABLED  :  S3  build  logs  are enabled for this build
                       project.

                     o DISABLED : S3 build logs are not enabled for this build
                       project.

                 location -> (string)
                     The  ARN of an S3 bucket and the path prefix for S3 logs.
                     If your Amazon S3 bucket name is  my-bucket  ,  and  your
                     path  prefix  is  build-log , then acceptable formats are
                     my-bucket/build-log or arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/build-log .

                 encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                     Set to true if you do not want your S3 build  log  output
                     encrypted. By default S3 build logs are encrypted.

                 bucketOwnerAccess -> (string)
                     Specifies  the bucket owner's access for objects that an-
                     other account uploads to their Amazon S3 bucket.  By  de-
                     fault,  only  the account that uploads the objects to the
                     bucket has access to these objects. This property  allows
                     you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

                     NOTE:
                        To use this property, your CodeBuild service role must
                        have the s3:PutBucketAcl permission.  This  permission
                        allows CodeBuild to modify the access control list for
                        the bucket.

                     This property can be one of the following values:
                        NONE

                     The bucket owner does not have  access  to  the  objects.
                     This is the default.
                        READ_ONLY

                     The bucket owner has read-only access to the objects. The
                     uploading account retains ownership of the objects.
                        FULL

                     The bucket owner has full access to the  objects.  Object
                     ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                     o If  the bucket is configured with the Bucket owner pre-
                       ferred setting, the bucket owner owns the objects.  The
                       uploading  account will have object access as specified
                       by the bucket's policy.

                     o Otherwise, the uploading account retains  ownership  of
                       the objects.

                     For  more  information  about Amazon S3 object ownership,
                     see Controlling ownership of uploaded  objects  using  S3
                     Object  Ownership  in  the  Amazon Simple Storage Service

          fileSystemLocations -> (list)
              An array of ProjectFileSystemLocation objects  for  a  CodeBuild
              build  project. A ProjectFileSystemLocation object specifies the
              identifier , location , mountOptions , mountPoint , and type  of
              a file system created using Amazon Elastic File System.

              (structure)
                 Information  about  a  file  system created by Amazon Elastic
                 File System (EFS). For more information, see What  Is  Amazon
                 Elastic File System?

                 type -> (string)
                     The  type  of  the file system. The one supported type is
                     EFS .

                 location -> (string)
                     A string that specifies the location of the  file  system
                     created by Amazon EFS. Its format is efs-dns-name:/direc-
                     tory-path . You can find the DNS name of file system when
                     you view it in the Amazon EFS console. The directory path
                     is a path to a directory in the file  system  that  Code-
                     Build mounts. For example, if the DNS name of a file sys-
                     tem is fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com , and  its
                     mount  directory is my-efs-mount-directory , then the lo-
                     cation        is        fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazon-
                     aws.com:/my-efs-mount-directory .

                     The  directory  path  in  the format efs-dns-name:/direc-
                     tory-path is optional. If you do not specify a  directory
                     path,  the  location  is  only the DNS name and CodeBuild
                     mounts the entire file system.

                 mountPoint -> (string)
                     The location in the container where you  mount  the  file
                     system.

                 identifier -> (string)
                     The  name  used to access a file system created by Amazon
                     EFS. CodeBuild creates an environment variable by append-
                     ing the identifier in all capital letters to CODEBUILD_ .
                     For example, if you specify my_efs for identifier , a new
                     environment variable is create named CODEBUILD_MY_EFS .

                     The identifier is used to mount your file system.

                 mountOptions -> (string)
                     The  mount  options  for  a file system created by Amazon
                     EFS. The default mount  options  used  by  CodeBuild  are
                     nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,re-
                     trans=2 . For more information, see Recommended NFS Mount
                     Options .

          buildBatchConfig -> (structure)
              A   ProjectBuildBatchConfig  object that defines the batch build
              options for the project.

              serviceRole -> (string)
                 Specifies the service role ARN for the batch build project.

              combineArtifacts -> (boolean)
                 Specifies if the build artifacts for the batch  build  should
                 be combined into a single artifact location.

              restrictions -> (structure)
                 A  BatchRestrictions  object  that specifies the restrictions
                 for the batch build.

                 maximumBuildsAllowed -> (integer)
                     Specifies the maximum number of builds allowed.

                 computeTypesAllowed -> (list)
                     An array of strings that specify the compute  types  that
                     are  allowed  for  the batch build. See Build environment
                     compute types in the CodeBuild User Guide for these  val-
                     ues.

                     (string)

              timeoutInMins -> (integer)
                 Specifies  the  maximum  amount of time, in minutes, that the
                 batch build must be completed in.

              batchReportMode -> (string)
                 Specifies how build status reports are  sent  to  the  source
                 provider for the batch build. This property is only used when
                 the source provider for your project is Bitbucket, GitHub, or
                 GitHub  Enterprise,  and your project is configured to report
                 build statuses to the source provider.
                     REPORT_AGGREGATED_BATCH

                 (Default) Aggregate all of the build statuses into  a  single
                 status report.

              The  maximum  number  of  concurrent builds that are allowed for
              this project.

              New builds are only started if the current number of  builds  is
              less  than  or  equal  to this limit. If the current build count
              meets this limit, new builds are throttled and are not run.

          projectVisibility -> (string)
              Specifies the visibility of the project's builds. Possible  val-
              ues are:
                 PUBLIC_READ

              The project builds are visible to the public.
