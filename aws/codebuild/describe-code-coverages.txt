DESCRIBE-CODE-COVERAGES()                            DESCRIBE-CODE-COVERAGES()



NAME
       describe-code-coverages -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves one or more code coverage reports.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-code-coverages  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: codeCoverages

SYNOPSIS
            describe-code-coverages
          --report-arn <value>
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--min-line-coverage-percentage <value>]
          [--max-line-coverage-percentage <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --report-arn (string)
          The ARN of the report for which test cases are returned.

       --sort-order (string)
          Specifies if the results are sorted in ascending or  descending  or-
          der.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --sort-by (string)
          Specifies how the results are sorted. Possible values are:
              FILE_PATH

          The results are sorted by file path.
              LINE_COVERAGE_PERCENTAGE

          The results are sorted by the percentage of lines that are covered.

          Possible values:

          o LINE_COVERAGE_PERCENTAGE

          o FILE_PATH

       --min-line-coverage-percentage (double)
          The minimum line coverage percentage to report.

       --max-line-coverage-percentage (double)
          The maximum line coverage percentage to report.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  get  detailed  information  about code coverage test results in AWS
       CodeBuild.

       The following describe-code-coverages example  gets  information  about
       the code coverage test results in the specified report.

          aws codebuild describe-code-coverages \
              --report-arn arn:aws:codebuild:<region-ID>:<account-ID>:report/<report-group-name>:<report-ID>

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          If there are more items to return, this contains  a  token  that  is
          passed to a subsequent call to DescribeCodeCoverages to retrieve the
          next set of items.

       codeCoverages -> (list)
          An array of CodeCoverage objects that contain the results.

          (structure)
              Contains code coverage report information.

              Line coverage measures how many statements your tests  cover.  A
              statement  is a single instruction, not including comments, con-
              ditionals, etc.

              Branch coverage determines if your tests  cover  every  possible
              branch of a control structure, such as an if or case statement.

              id -> (string)
                 The identifier of the code coverage report.

              reportARN -> (string)
                 The ARN of the report.

              filePath -> (string)
                 The path of the test report file.

              lineCoveragePercentage -> (double)
                 The percentage of lines that are covered by your tests.

              linesCovered -> (integer)
                 The number of lines that are covered by your tests.

              linesMissed -> (integer)
                 The number of lines that are not covered by your tests.

              branchCoveragePercentage -> (double)
                 The percentage of branches that are covered by your tests.

              branchesCovered -> (integer)
                 The  number  of conditional branches that are covered by your
                 tests.

              branchesMissed -> (integer)
                 The number of conditional branches that are  not  covered  by
                 your tests.

              expired -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the tests were run.
