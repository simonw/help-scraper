DESCRIBE-CODE-COVERAGES()                            DESCRIBE-CODE-COVERAGES()



NAME
       describe-code-coverages -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves one or more code coverage reports.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-code-coverages  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: codeCoverages

OPTIONS
       --report-arn (string)
          The ARN of the report for which test cases are returned.

       --sort-order (string)
          Specifies if the results are sorted in ascending or  descending  or-
          der.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --sort-by (string)
          Specifies how the results are sorted. Possible values are:
              FILE_PATH

          The results are sorted by file path.
              LINE_COVERAGE_PERCENTAGE

          The results are sorted by the percentage of lines that are covered.

          Possible values:

          o LINE_COVERAGE_PERCENTAGE

          o FILE_PATH

       --min-line-coverage-percentage (double)
          The minimum line coverage percentage to report.

       --max-line-coverage-percentage (double)
          The maximum line coverage percentage to report.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          If there are more items to return, this contains  a  token  that  is
          passed to a subsequent call to DescribeCodeCoverages to retrieve the
          next set of items.

              Line coverage measures how many statements your tests  cover.  A
              statement  is a single instruction, not including comments, con-
              ditionals, etc.

              Branch coverage determines if your tests  cover  every  possible
              branch of a control structure, such as an if or case statement.

              id -> (string)
                 The identifier of the code coverage report.

              reportARN -> (string)
                 The ARN of the report.

              filePath -> (string)
                 The path of the test report file.

              lineCoveragePercentage -> (double)
                 The percentage of lines that are covered by your tests.

              linesCovered -> (integer)
                 The number of lines that are covered by your tests.

              linesMissed -> (integer)
                 The number of lines that are not covered by your tests.

              branchCoveragePercentage -> (double)
                 The percentage of branches that are covered by your tests.

              branchesCovered -> (integer)
                 The  number  of conditional branches that are covered by your
                 tests.

              branchesMissed -> (integer)
                 The number of conditional branches that are  not  covered  by
                 your tests.

              expired -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the tests were run.
