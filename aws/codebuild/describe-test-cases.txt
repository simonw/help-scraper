DESCRIBE-TEST-CASES()                                    DESCRIBE-TEST-CASES()



NAME
       describe-test-cases -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of details about test cases for a report.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-test-cases is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: testCases

SYNOPSIS
            describe-test-cases
          --report-arn <value>
          [--filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --report-arn (string)
          The ARN of the report for which test cases are returned.

       --filter (structure)
          A TestCaseFilter object used to filter the returned reports.

          status -> (string)
              The status used to filter test cases. A TestCaseFilter can  have
              one status. Valid values are:

              o SUCCEEDED

              o FAILED

              o ERROR

              o SKIPPED

              o UNKNOWN

          keyword -> (string)
              A  keyword  that  is used to filter on the name or the prefix of
              the test cases. Only test cases where the keyword is a substring
              of the name or the prefix will be returned.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          status=string,keyword=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "status": "string",
            "keyword": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       The  following  describe-test-cases  example gets information about the
       test cases in the specified report.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          During  a previous call, the maximum number of items that can be re-
          turned is the value specified in maxResults . If there more items in
          the  list,  then  a unique string called a nextToken is returned. To
          get the next batch of items in the list, call this operation  again,
          adding  the  next  token to the call. To get all of the items in the
          list, keep calling this operation with each  subsequent  next  token
          that is returned, until no more next tokens are returned.

       testCases -> (list)
          The returned list of test cases.

          (structure)
              Information  about a test case created using a framework such as
              NUnit or Cucumber. A test case might be a unit test or a config-
              uration test.

              reportArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the report to which the test case belongs.

              testRawDataPath -> (string)
                 The path to the raw data file that contains the test result.

              prefix -> (string)
                 A  string  that is applied to a series of related test cases.
                 CodeBuild generates the prefix. The  prefix  depends  on  the
                 framework used to generate the tests.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the test case.

              status -> (string)
                 The  status returned by the test case after it was run. Valid
                 statuses are SUCCEEDED , FAILED , ERROR , SKIPPED ,  and  UN-
                 KNOWN .

              durationInNanoSeconds -> (long)
                 The number of nanoseconds it took to run this test case.

              message -> (string)
                 A  message associated with a test case. For example, an error
                 message or stack trace.

              expired -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time a test case expires. A test case expires 30
                 days  after it is created. An expired test case is not avail-
                 able to view in CodeBuild.
