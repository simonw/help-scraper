OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the build project.

       --description (string)
          A description that makes the build project easy to identify.

       --source (structure)
          Information about the build input source code for the build project.

          type -> (string)
              The  type  of  repository  that  contains  the source code to be
              built. Valid values include:

              o BITBUCKET : The source code is in a Bitbucket repository.

              o CODECOMMIT : The source code is in an CodeCommit repository.

              o CODEPIPELINE : The source code settings are specified  in  the
                source action of a pipeline in CodePipeline.

              o GITHUB  :  The source code is in a GitHub or GitHub Enterprise
                Cloud repository.

              o GITHUB_ENTERPRISE : The source code is in a GitHub  Enterprise
                Server repository.

              o NO_SOURCE : The project does not have input source code.

              o S3 : The source code is in an Amazon S3 bucket.

          location -> (string)
              Information  about  the location of the source code to be built.
              Valid values include:

              o For source code settings that are specified in the source  ac-
                tion  of  a  pipeline  in CodePipeline, location should not be
                specified. If it is specified, CodePipeline ignores  it.  This
                is  because  CodePipeline  uses  the  settings in a pipeline's
                source action instead of this value.

              o For source code in an CodeCommit repository, the  HTTPS  clone
                URL  to  the  repository that contains the source code and the
                buildspec  file  (for   example,   https://git-codecommit.<re-
                gion-ID>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/<repo-name> ).

              o For  source code in an Amazon S3 input bucket, one of the fol-
                lowing.

                o The path to the ZIP file that contains the source code  (for
                  example, <bucket-name>/<path>/<object-name>.zip ).

                o The  path  to  the folder that contains the source code (for
                  example, <bucket-name>/<path-to-source-code>/<folder>/ ).

              o For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to
                the  repository  that  contains  the  source and the buildspec
                file. You must connect your Amazon  Web  Services  account  to
                your GitHub account. Use the CodeBuild console to start creat-
                ing a build project. When you use the console to  connect  (or
                reconnect)  with  GitHub,  on the GitHub Authorize application
                page, for Organization access , choose Request access next  to
                each repository you want to allow CodeBuild to have access to,
                and then choose Authorize application . (After you  have  con-
                nected  to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish cre-
                ating the build project. You can leave the CodeBuild console.)
                To  instruct  CodeBuild  to use this connection, in the source
                object, set the auth object's type value to OAUTH .

              o For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL
                to  the  repository that contains the source and the buildspec
                file. You must connect your Amazon  Web  Services  account  to
                your  Bitbucket  account.  Use  the CodeBuild console to start
                creating a build project. When you use the console to  connect
                (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket Confirm access
                to your account page, choose Grant access .  (After  you  have
                connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish
                creating the build project. You can leave the  CodeBuild  con-
                sole.)  To  instruct  CodeBuild to use this connection, in the
                source object, set the auth object's type value to OAUTH .

              If you specify CODEPIPELINE for the Type property, don't specify
              this  property. For all of the other types, you must specify Lo-
              cation .

          gitCloneDepth -> (integer)
              Information about the Git clone depth for the build project.

          gitSubmodulesConfig -> (structure)
              Information about the Git submodules configuration for the build
              project.

              fetchSubmodules -> (boolean)
                 Set  to true to fetch Git submodules for your CodeBuild build
                 project.

          buildspec -> (string)
              The buildspec file declaration to use for  the  builds  in  this
              build project.

              If this value is set, it can be either an inline buildspec defi-
              nition, the path to an alternate buildspec file relative to  the
              value of the built-in CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR environment variable, or
              the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in the same  Amazon
              Web  Services Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec
              file using its ARN (for example,  arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sam-
              ple2/buildspec.yml ). If this value is not provided or is set to
              an empty string, the source code must contain a  buildspec  file
              in  its root directory. For more information, see Buildspec File
              Name and Storage Location .

          auth -> (structure)
              Information about the authorization settings  for  CodeBuild  to
              access the source code to be built.

              This  information  is for the CodeBuild console's use only. Your
              code should not get or set this information directly.

              type -> (string)

                 NOTE:
                     This data type is deprecated and is no longer accurate or
                     used.

                 The  authorization type to use. The only valid value is OAUTH
                 , which represents the OAuth authorization type.

              resource -> (string)
                 The resource value that applies to the  specified  authoriza-
                 tion type.

          reportBuildStatus -> (boolean)
              Set  to  true to report the status of a build's start and finish
              to your source provider. This option is  valid  only  when  your
              source  provider  is GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket. If
              this is set and you use a different source provider, an invalid-
              InputException is thrown.

              To  be  able  to report the build status to the source provider,
              the user associated with the source provider must have write ac-
              cess  to  the  repo. If the user does not have write access, the
              build status cannot be updated. For more information, see Source
              provider access in the CodeBuild User Guide .

              The  status of a build triggered by a webhook is always reported
              to your source provider.

              If your project's builds are triggered by a  webhook,  you  must
              push  a  new commit to the repo for a change to this property to
              take effect.

          buildStatusConfig -> (structure)
              Contains information that defines how the build project  reports
              the  build  status  to  the source provider. This option is only
              used when the source provider is GITHUB , GITHUB_ENTERPRISE , or
              BITBUCKET .

              context -> (string)
                 Specifies  the context of the build status CodeBuild sends to
                 the source provider. The usage of this parameter  depends  on
                 the source provider.
                     Bitbucket

                 This  parameter  is  used  for the name parameter in the Bit-
                 bucket commit status. For more information, see build in  the
                 Bitbucket API documentation.
                     GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server

                 This  parameter  is  used  for  the  context parameter in the
                 GitHub commit status. For more information, see Create a com-
                 mit status in the GitHub developer guide.

              targetUrl -> (string)
                 Specifies  the target url of the build status CodeBuild sends
                 to the source provider. The usage of this  parameter  depends
                 on the source provider.
                     Bitbucket

                 This parameter is used for the url parameter in the Bitbucket
                 commit status. For more information, see build  in  the  Bit-
                 bucket API documentation.
                     GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server

                 This  parameter  is  used for the target_url parameter in the
                 GitHub commit status. For more information, see Create a com-
                 mit status in the GitHub developer guide.

          insecureSsl -> (boolean)
              Enable  this flag to ignore SSL warnings while connecting to the
              project source code.

          sourceIdentifier -> (string)
              An identifier for this project source. The identifier  can  only
              contain  alphanumeric  characters  and  underscores, and must be
              less than 128 characters in length.

       --secondary-sources (list)
          An array of ProjectSource objects.

          (structure)
              Information about the build input  source  code  for  the  build
              project.

              type -> (string)
                 The  type  of  repository that contains the source code to be
                 built. Valid values include:

                 o BITBUCKET : The source code is in a Bitbucket repository.

                 o CODECOMMIT : The source code is in  an  CodeCommit  reposi-
                   tory.

                 o CODEPIPELINE  :  The  source code settings are specified in
                   the source action of a pipeline in CodePipeline.

                 o GITHUB : The source code is in a GitHub  or  GitHub  Enter-
                   prise Cloud repository.

                 o GITHUB_ENTERPRISE  :  The source code is in a GitHub Enter-
                   prise Server repository.

                 o NO_SOURCE : The project does not have input source code.

                 o S3 : The source code is in an Amazon S3 bucket.

              location -> (string)
                 Information about the location  of  the  source  code  to  be
                 built. Valid values include:

                 o For  source  code settings that are specified in the source
                   action of a pipeline in CodePipeline, location  should  not
                   be  specified. If it is specified, CodePipeline ignores it.
                   This is because CodePipeline uses the settings in  a  pipe-
                   line's source action instead of this value.

                 o For  source  code  in  an  CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS
                   clone URL to the repository that contains the  source  code
                   and  the  buildspec file (for example, https://git-codecom-
                   mit.<region-ID>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/<repo-name> ).

                 o For source code in an Amazon S3 input bucket,  one  of  the
                   following.

                   o The  path  to  the ZIP file that contains the source code
                     (for example, <bucket-name>/<path>/<object-name>.zip ).

                   o The path to the folder that contains the source code (for
                     example, <bucket-name>/<path-to-source-code>/<folder>/ ).

                 o For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL
                   to the repository that contains the source and  the  build-
                   spec  file.  You  must connect your Amazon Web Services ac-
                   count to your GitHub account. Use the CodeBuild console  to
                   start creating a build project. When you use the console to
                   connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub Authorize
                   application  page, for Organization access , choose Request
                   access next to each repository you want to allow  CodeBuild
                   to  have access to, and then choose Authorize application .
                   (After you have connected to your GitHub  account,  you  do
                   not  need  to  finish  creating  the build project. You can
                   leave the CodeBuild console.) To instruct CodeBuild to  use
                   this  connection,  in  the  source object, set the auth ob-
                   ject's type value to OAUTH .

                 o For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS  clone
                   URL  to  the  repository  that  contains the source and the
                   buildspec file. You must connect your Amazon  Web  Services
                   account  to  your Bitbucket account. Use the CodeBuild con-
                   sole to start creating a build project. When  you  use  the
                   console  to  connect  (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the
                   Bitbucket Confirm access to your account page, choose Grant
                   access  .  (After  you have connected to your Bitbucket ac-
                   count, you  do  not  need  to  finish  creating  the  build
                   project.  You can leave the CodeBuild console.) To instruct
                   CodeBuild to use this connection, in the source object, set
                   the auth object's type value to OAUTH .

                 If  you  specify  CODEPIPELINE  for  the Type property, don't
                 specify this property. For all of the other types,  you  must
                 specify Location .

              gitCloneDepth -> (integer)
                 Information about the Git clone depth for the build project.

              gitSubmodulesConfig -> (structure)
                 Information  about  the  Git submodules configuration for the
                 build project.

                 fetchSubmodules -> (boolean)
                     Set to true to fetch Git submodules  for  your  CodeBuild
                     build project.

              buildspec -> (string)
                 The  buildspec file declaration to use for the builds in this
                 build project.

                 If this value is set, it can be either  an  inline  buildspec
                 definition,  the path to an alternate buildspec file relative
                 to the value of the  built-in  CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR  environment
                 variable,  or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in
                 the same Amazon Web Services Region  as  the  build  project.
                 Specify  the  buildspec  file  using  its  ARN  (for example,
                 arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml  ).  If  this
                 value  is  not  provided  or  is  set to an empty string, the
                 source code must contain a buildspec file in its root  direc-
                 tory. For more information, see Buildspec File Name and Stor-
                 age Location .

              auth -> (structure)
                 Information about the authorization settings for CodeBuild to
                 access the source code to be built.

                 This  information  is  for  the CodeBuild console's use only.
                 Your code should not get or set this information directly.

                 type -> (string)

                     NOTE:
                        This data type is deprecated and is no longer accurate
                        or used.

                     The  authorization  type  to use. The only valid value is
                     OAUTH , which represents the OAuth authorization type.

                 resource -> (string)
                     The resource value that applies to the  specified  autho-
                     rization type.

              reportBuildStatus -> (boolean)
                 Set  to true to report the status of a build's start and fin-
                 ish to your source provider. This option is valid  only  when
                 your  source  provider  is GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bit-
                 bucket. If this  is  set  and  you  use  a  different  source
                 provider, an invalidInputException is thrown.

                 To be able to report the build status to the source provider,
                 the user associated with the source provider must have  write
                 access  to  the repo. If the user does not have write access,
                 the build status cannot be updated. For more information, see
                 Source provider access in the CodeBuild User Guide .

                 The  status  of  a build triggered by a webhook is always re-
                 ported to your source provider.

                 If your project's builds are triggered by a webhook, you must
                 push  a  new commit to the repo for a change to this property
                 to take effect.

              buildStatusConfig -> (structure)
                 Contains information that defines how the build  project  re-
                 ports the build status to the source provider. This option is
                 only used when the source provider is GITHUB ,  GITHUB_ENTER-
                 PRISE , or BITBUCKET .

                 context -> (string)
                     Specifies the context of the build status CodeBuild sends
                     to the source provider. The usage of this  parameter  de-
                     pends on the source provider.
                        Bitbucket

                     This parameter is used for the name parameter in the Bit-
                     bucket commit status. For more information, see build  in
                     the Bitbucket API documentation.
                        GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server

                     This  parameter  is used for the context parameter in the
                     GitHub commit status. For more information, see Create  a
                     commit status in the GitHub developer guide.

                 targetUrl -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  target  url of the build status CodeBuild
                     sends to the source provider. The usage of this parameter
                     depends on the source provider.
                        Bitbucket

                     This  parameter is used for the url parameter in the Bit-
                     bucket commit status. For more information, see build  in
                     the Bitbucket API documentation.
                        GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server

                     This  parameter  is  used for the target_url parameter in
                     the GitHub  commit  status.  For  more  information,  see
                     Create a commit status in the GitHub developer guide.

              insecureSsl -> (boolean)
                 Enable  this  flag to ignore SSL warnings while connecting to
                 the project source code.

              sourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 An identifier for this project  source.  The  identifier  can
                 only  contain  alphanumeric  characters  and underscores, and
                 must be less than 128 characters in length.

       --source-version (string)
          A version of the build input to be built for this  project.  If  not
          specified,  the latest version is used. If specified, it must be one
          of:

          o For CodeCommit: the commit ID, branch, or Git tag to use.

          o For GitHub: the commit ID, pull request ID, branch  name,  or  tag
            name  that  corresponds to the version of the source code you want
            to build. If a pull request ID is specified, it must use the  for-
            mat  pr/pull-request-ID  (for example pr/25 ). If a branch name is
            specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not  specified,
            the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

          o For Bitbucket: the commit ID, branch name, or tag name that corre-
            sponds to the version of the source code you want to build.  If  a
            branch  name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If
            not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

          o For Amazon S3: the version ID of the object  that  represents  the
            build input ZIP file to use.

          If  sourceVersion is specified at the build level, then that version
          takes precedence over this sourceVersion (at the project level).

          For more information, see Source Version Sample  with  CodeBuild  in
          the CodeBuild User Guide .

       --secondary-source-versions (list)
          An array of ProjectSourceVersion objects. If secondarySourceVersions
          is specified at the build level,  then  they  take  precedence  over
          these secondarySourceVersions (at the project level).

          (structure)
              A source identifier and its corresponding version.

              sourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 An  identifier for a source in the build project. The identi-
                 fier can only  contain  alphanumeric  characters  and  under-
                 scores, and must be less than 128 characters in length.

              sourceVersion -> (string)
                 The  source  version for the corresponding source identifier.
                 If specified, must be one of:

                 o For CodeCommit: the commit ID, branch, or Git tag to use.

                 o For GitHub: the commit ID, pull request ID, branch name, or
                   tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code
                   you want to build. If a pull request ID  is  specified,  it
                   must  use the format pr/pull-request-ID (for example, pr/25
                   ). If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD  commit
                   ID  is  used.  If  not specified, the default branch's HEAD
                   commit ID is used.

                 o For Bitbucket: the commit ID, branch name, or tag name that
                   corresponds  to  the version of the source code you want to
                   build. If a branch name is  specified,  the  branch's  HEAD
                   commit  ID  is used. If not specified, the default branch's
                   HEAD commit ID is used.

                 o For Amazon S3: the version ID of the object that represents
                   the build input ZIP file to use.

       --artifacts (structure)
          Information about the build output artifacts for the build project.

          type -> (string)
              The type of build output artifact. Valid values include:

              o CODEPIPELINE : The build project has  build  output  generated
                through CodePipeline.

              NOTE:
                 The CODEPIPELINE type is not supported for secondaryArtifacts
                 .

              o NO_ARTIFACTS : The build project does not  produce  any  build
                output.

              o S3 : The build project stores build output in Amazon S3.

          location -> (string)
              Information about the build output artifact location:

              o If  type  is  set  to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores this
                value if specified. This is because CodePipeline  manages  its
                build output locations instead of CodeBuild.

              o If  type  is  set  to  NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored if
                specified, because no build output is produced.

              o If type is set to S3 , this is the name of the output bucket.

          path -> (string)
              Along with namespaceType and name , the pattern  that  CodeBuild
              uses to name and store the output artifact:

              o If  type  is  set  to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores this
                value if specified. This is because CodePipeline  manages  its
                build output names instead of CodeBuild.

              o If  type  is  set  to  NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored if
                specified, because no build output is produced.

              o If type is set to S3 , this is the path to  the  output  arti-
                fact. If path is not specified, path is not used.

              For  example,  if  path is set to MyArtifacts , namespaceType is
              set to NONE , and name is set to MyArtifact.zip , the output ar-
              tifact  is  stored  in  the output bucket at MyArtifacts/MyArti-
              fact.zip .

          namespaceType -> (string)
              Along with path and name , the pattern that  CodeBuild  uses  to
              determine the name and location to store the output artifact:

              o If  type  is  set  to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores this
                value if specified. This is because CodePipeline  manages  its
                build output names instead of CodeBuild.

              o If  type  is  set  to  NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored if
                specified, because no build output is produced.

              o If type is set to S3 , valid values include:

                o BUILD_ID : Include the build ID in the location of the build
                  output artifact.

                o NONE  :  Do not include the build ID. This is the default if
                  namespaceType is not specified.

              For example, if path is set to MyArtifacts  ,  namespaceType  is
              set to BUILD_ID , and name is set to MyArtifact.zip , the output
              artifact is stored in MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip .

          name -> (string)
              Along with path and namespaceType , the pattern  that  CodeBuild
              uses to name and store the output artifact:

              o If  type  is  set  to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores this
                value if specified. This is because CodePipeline  manages  its
                build output names instead of CodeBuild.

              o If  type  is  set  to  NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored if
                specified, because no build output is produced.

              o If type is set to S3 , this is the name of the output artifact
                object.  If  you set the name to be a forward slash ("/"), the
                artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket.

              For example:

              o If path is set  to  MyArtifacts  ,  namespaceType  is  set  to
                BUILD_ID , and name is set to MyArtifact.zip , then the output
                artifact is stored in MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip .

              o If path is empty, namespaceType is set to NONE , and  name  is
                set  to "/ ", the output artifact is stored in the root of the
                output bucket.

              o If path is set  to  MyArtifacts  ,  namespaceType  is  set  to
                BUILD_ID  ,  and  name  is set to "/ ", the output artifact is
                stored in MyArtifacts/<build-ID> .

          packaging -> (string)
              The type of build output artifact to create:

              o If type is set to CODEPIPELINE  ,  CodePipeline  ignores  this
                value  if  specified. This is because CodePipeline manages its
                build output artifacts instead of CodeBuild.

              o If type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS ,  this  value  is  ignored  if
                specified, because no build output is produced.

              o If type is set to S3 , valid values include:

                o NONE  : CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a folder that
                  contains the build output. This is the default if  packaging
                  is not specified.

                o ZIP : CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a ZIP file that
                  contains the build output.

          overrideArtifactName -> (boolean)
              If this flag is set, a name  specified  in  the  buildspec  file
              overrides  the  artifact name. The name specified in a buildspec
              file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Command Lan-
              guage. For example, you can append a date and time to your arti-
              fact name so that it is always unique.

          encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
              Set to true if you do not want your output artifacts  encrypted.
              This  option  is valid only if your artifacts type is Amazon S3.
              If this is set with another artifacts type,  an  invalidInputEx-
              ception is thrown.

          artifactIdentifier -> (string)
              An identifier for this artifact definition.

          bucketOwnerAccess -> (string)
              Specifies the bucket owner's access for objects that another ac-
              count uploads to their Amazon S3 bucket. By  default,  only  the
              account  that  uploads  the  objects to the bucket has access to
              these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket owner
              access to these objects.

              NOTE:
                 To  use  this property, your CodeBuild service role must have
                 the s3:PutBucketAcl permission. This permission allows  Code-
                 Build to modify the access control list for the bucket.

              This property can be one of the following values:
                 NONE

              The  bucket  owner  does not have access to the objects. This is
              the default.
                 READ_ONLY

              The bucket owner has read-only access to the  objects.  The  up-
              loading account retains ownership of the objects.
                 FULL

              The  bucket  owner has full access to the objects. Object owner-
              ship is determined by the following criteria:

              o If the bucket is configured with the  Bucket  owner  preferred
                setting,  the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading ac-
                count will have object access as  specified  by  the  bucket's
                policy.

              o Otherwise,  the uploading account retains ownership of the ob-
                jects.

              For more information  about  Amazon  S3  object  ownership,  see
              Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Owner-
              ship in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide .

                   value  if  specified.  This is because CodePipeline manages
                   its build output locations instead of CodeBuild.

                 o If type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is  ignored  if
                   specified, because no build output is produced.

                 o If  type  is  set  to  S3  , this is the name of the output
                   bucket.

              path -> (string)
                 Along with namespaceType and name , the  pattern  that  Code-
                 Build uses to name and store the output artifact:

                 o If  type is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores this
                   value if specified. This is  because  CodePipeline  manages
                   its build output names instead of CodeBuild.

                   specified, because no build output is produced.

                 o If type is set to S3 , this is the path to the output arti-
                   fact. If path is not specified, path is not used.

                 For example, if path is set to MyArtifacts , namespaceType is
                 set to NONE , and name is set to MyArtifact.zip , the  output
                 artifact   is   stored   in  the  output  bucket  at  MyArti-
                 facts/MyArtifact.zip .

              namespaceType -> (string)
                 Along with path and name , the pattern that CodeBuild uses to
                 determine the name and location to store the output artifact:

                 o If  type is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores this
                   value if specified. This is  because  CodePipeline  manages
                   its build output names instead of CodeBuild.

                 o If  type  is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored if
                   specified, because no build output is produced.

                 o If type is set to S3 , valid values include:

                   o BUILD_ID : Include the build ID in the  location  of  the
                     build output artifact.

                   o NONE  :  Do not include the build ID. This is the default
                     if namespaceType is not specified.

                 For example, if path is set to MyArtifacts , namespaceType is
                 set  to  BUILD_ID  ,  and name is set to MyArtifact.zip , the
                 output artifact is stored  in  MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArti-
                 fact.zip .

              name -> (string)
                 Along  with  path  and namespaceType , the pattern that Code-
                 Build uses to name and store the output artifact:

                 o If type is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores  this
                   value  if  specified.  This is because CodePipeline manages
                   its build output names instead of CodeBuild.

                 o If type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is  ignored  if
                   specified, because no build output is produced.

                 o If type is set to S3 , this is the name of the output arti-
                   fact object. If you set the name  to  be  a  forward  slash
                   ("/"),  the  artifact  is  stored in the root of the output
                   bucket.

                 For example:

                 o If path is set to MyArtifacts ,  namespaceType  is  set  to
                   BUILD_ID  ,  and  name  is set to MyArtifact.zip , then the
                   output artifact is stored in MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArti-
                   fact.zip .

                 o If  path  is empty, namespaceType is set to NONE , and name
                   is set to "/ ", the output artifact is stored in  the  root
                   of the output bucket.

                 o If  path  is  set  to MyArtifacts , namespaceType is set to
                   BUILD_ID , and name is set to "/ ", the output artifact  is
                   stored in MyArtifacts/<build-ID> .

              packaging -> (string)
                 The type of build output artifact to create:

                 o If  type is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores this
                   value if specified. This is  because  CodePipeline  manages
                   its build output artifacts instead of CodeBuild.

                 o If  type  is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored if
                   specified, because no build output is produced.

                 o If type is set to S3 , valid values include:

                   o NONE : CodeBuild creates in the output  bucket  a  folder
                     that  contains  the  build output. This is the default if
                     packaging is not specified.

                   o ZIP : CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a  ZIP  file
                     that contains the build output.

              overrideArtifactName -> (boolean)
                 If  this  flag is set, a name specified in the buildspec file
                 overrides the artifact name. The name specified in  a  build-
                 spec file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Com-
                 mand Language. For example, you can append a date and time to
                 your artifact name so that it is always unique.

              encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                 Set  to  true  if  you  do not want your output artifacts en-
                 crypted. This option is valid only if your artifacts type  is
                 Amazon S3. If this is set with another artifacts type, an in-
                 validInputException is thrown.

              artifactIdentifier -> (string)
                 An identifier for this artifact definition.

              bucketOwnerAccess -> (string)
                 Specifies the bucket owner's access for objects that  another
                 account  uploads  to their Amazon S3 bucket. By default, only
                 the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access
                 to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket
                 owner access to these objects.

                 NOTE:
                     To use this property, your CodeBuild  service  role  must
                     have  the s3:PutBucketAcl permission. This permission al-
                     lows CodeBuild to modify the access control list for  the
                     bucket.

                 This property can be one of the following values:
                     NONE

                 The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is
                 the default.
                     READ_ONLY

                 The bucket owner has read-only access to the objects. The up-
                 loading account retains ownership of the objects.
                     FULL

                 The  bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object own-
                 ership is determined by the following criteria:

                 o If the bucket is configured with the Bucket owner preferred
                   setting,  the  bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading
                   account  will  have  object  access  as  specified  by  the
                   bucket's policy.

                 o Otherwise,  the  uploading account retains ownership of the
                   objects.

                 For more information about Amazon S3  object  ownership,  see
                 Controlling  ownership  of  uploaded  objects using S3 Object
                 Ownership in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide .

       --cache (structure)
          Stores recently used information so that it can be quickly  accessed
          at a later time.

          type -> (string)
              The  type  of  cache used by the build project. Valid values in-
              clude:

              o NO_CACHE : The build project does not use any cache.

              o S3 : The build project reads and writes from and to S3.

              o LOCAL : The build project stores a cache locally  on  a  build
                host that is only available to that build host.

          location -> (string)
              Information about the cache location:

              o NO_CACHE or LOCAL : This value is ignored.

              o S3 : This is the S3 bucket name/prefix.

          modes -> (list)
              An  array of strings that specify the local cache modes. You can
              use one or more local cache modes at the same time. This is only
              used for LOCAL cache types.

              Possible values are:
                 LOCAL_SOURCE_CACHE

              Caches Git metadata for primary and secondary sources. After the
              cache is created, subsequent builds pull only the change between
              commits.  This  mode  is a good choice for projects with a clean
              working directory and a source that is a large  Git  repository.
              If  you  choose  this option and your project does not use a Git
              repository (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket), the option
              is ignored.
                 LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE

              Caches  existing  Docker  layers. This mode is a good choice for
              projects that build or pull large Docker images. It can  prevent
              the  performance  issues  caused  by pulling large Docker images
              down from the network.

              NOTE:

                 o You can use a Docker layer cache in the  Linux  environment
                   only.

                 o The  privileged  flag  must be set so that your project has
                   the required Docker permissions.

                 o You should consider the security  implications  before  you
                   use a Docker layer cache.

                 LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE

              Caches  directories you specify in the buildspec file. This mode
              is a good choice if your build scenario is not suited to one  of
              the other three local cache modes. If you use a custom cache:

              o Only  directories  can  be  specified  for caching. You cannot
                specify individual files.

              o Symlinks are used to reference cached directories.

              o Cached directories are linked to your build  before  it  down-
                loads  its  project  sources. Cached items are overridden if a
                source item has the same name. Directories are specified using
                cache paths in the buildspec file.

          image -> (string)
              The image tag or image digest that identifies the  Docker  image
              to use for this build project. Use the following formats:

              o For an image tag: <registry>/<repository>:<tag> . For example,
                in the Docker repository that CodeBuild  uses  to  manage  its
                Docker images, this would be aws/codebuild/standard:4.0 .

              o For  an  image  digest: <registry>/<repository>@<digest> . For
                example,   to   specify   an    image    with    the    digest

          computeType -> (string)
              Information  about the compute resources the build project uses.
              Available values include:

              o BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL : Use up to 3 GB memory and 2  vCPUs  for
                builds.

              o BUILD_GENERAL1_MEDIUM  : Use up to 7 GB memory and 4 vCPUs for

                ports Docker images up to 100 GB uncompressed.

              If you use BUILD_GENERAL1_LARGE :

              o For environment type LINUX_CONTAINER , you can use up to 15 GB
                memory and 8 vCPUs for builds.

              o For environment type LINUX_GPU_CONTAINER , you can use  up  to
                255  GB  memory,  32  vCPUs,  and 4 NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs for

          environmentVariables -> (list)
              A set of environment variables to make available to  builds  for
              this build project.

              (structure)
                 Information about an environment variable for a build project
                 or a build.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name or key of the environment variable.

                 value -> (string)
                     The value of the environment variable.

                     WARNING:
                        We strongly discourage the use of  PLAINTEXT  environ-
                        ment  variables  to store sensitive values, especially
                        Amazon Web Services secret key IDs and  secret  access
                        keys. PLAINTEXT environment variables can be displayed
                        in plain text using the CodeBuild console and the CLI.
                        For sensitive values, we recommend you use an environ-
                        ment variable of type PARAMETER_STORE or  SECRETS_MAN-
                        AGER .

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of environment variable. Valid values include:

                     o PARAMETER_STORE  :  An  environment  variable stored in
                       Systems Manager Parameter Store. To learn how to  spec-
                       ify   a   parameter  store  environment  variable,  see
                       env/parameter-store in the CodeBuild User Guide .

                     o PLAINTEXT : An environment variable in plain text  for-
                       mat. This is the default value.

                     o SECRETS_MANAGER : An environment variable stored in Se-
                       crets Manager. To learn how to specify a  secrets  man-
                       ager  environment  variable, see env/secrets-manager in
                       the CodeBuild User Guide .

          privilegedMode -> (boolean)
              Enables running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container. Set
              to  true  only  if the build project is used to build Docker im-
              ages. Otherwise, a build that  attempts  to  interact  with  the
              Docker daemon fails. The default setting is false .

              You can initialize the Docker daemon during the install phase of
              your build by adding one of the following sets  of  commands  to
              the install phase of your buildspec file:

              If the operating system's base image is Ubuntu Linux:
                 -                 nohup                /usr/local/bin/dockerd
                 --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock  --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375
                 --storage-driver=overlay&

                 -  timeout  15  sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1;
                 done"

              If the operating system's base image is  Alpine  Linux  and  the
              previous command does not work, add the -t argument to timeout :
                 -                 nohup                /usr/local/bin/dockerd
                 --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock  --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375
                 --storage-driver=overlay&

                 - timeout -t 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1;
                 done"

          certificate -> (string)
              The ARN of the Amazon S3 bucket, path  prefix,  and  object  key
              that contains the PEM-encoded certificate for the build project.
              For more information, see  certificate  in  the  CodeBuild  User
              Guide .

          registryCredential -> (structure)
              The credentials for access to a private registry.

              credential -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or name of credentials created
                 using Secrets Manager.

                 NOTE:
                     The credential can use the name of the  credentials  only
                     if they exist in your current Amazon Web Services Region.

              credentialProvider -> (string)
                 The  service that created the credentials to access a private
                 Docker registry. The valid value, SECRETS_MANAGER, is for Se-
                 crets Manager.

          imagePullCredentialsType -> (string)
              The  type  of  credentials CodeBuild uses to pull images in your
              build. There are two valid values:

              o CODEBUILD specifies that CodeBuild uses its  own  credentials.
                This  requires  that  you modify your ECR repository policy to
                trust CodeBuild service principal.

              o SERVICE_ROLE  specifies  that  CodeBuild   uses   your   build
                project's service role.

              When you use a cross-account or private registry image, you must
              use SERVICE_ROLE credentials. When you use an CodeBuild  curated
              image, you must use CODEBUILD credentials.

              artifacts if your service role has permission to that key.

          You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK or,
          if  available,  the CMK's alias (using the format alias/<alias-name>
          ).

       --tags (list)
          A list of tag  key  and  value  pairs  associated  with  this  build
          project.

          project's build badge.

       --logs-config (structure)
          Information about logs for the build project. These can be  logs  in
          CloudWatch Logs, logs uploaded to a specified S3 bucket, or both.

          cloudWatchLogs -> (structure)
              Information  about  CloudWatch  Logs for a build project. Cloud-

          s3Logs -> (structure)
              Information about logs  built  to  an  S3  bucket  for  a  build
              project. S3 logs are not enabled by default.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status of the S3 build logs. Valid values are:

                 o ENABLED : S3 build logs are enabled for this build project.

                 o DISABLED  :  S3  build  logs are not enabled for this build
                   project.

              location -> (string)
                 The ARN of an S3 bucket and the path prefix for S3  logs.  If
                 your  Amazon S3 bucket name is my-bucket , and your path pre-
                 fix   is   build-log   ,   then   acceptable   formats    are
                 my-bucket/build-log or arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/build-log .

              encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                 Set  to  true if you do not want your S3 build log output en-
                 crypted. By default S3 build logs are encrypted.

              bucketOwnerAccess -> (string)
                 Specifies the bucket owner's access for objects that  another
                 account  uploads  to their Amazon S3 bucket. By default, only
                 the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access
                 to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket
                 owner access to these objects.

                 NOTE:
                     To use this property, your CodeBuild  service  role  must
                     have  the s3:PutBucketAcl permission. This permission al-
                     lows CodeBuild to modify the access control list for  the
                     bucket.

                 This property can be one of the following values:
                     NONE

                 The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is
                 the default.
                     READ_ONLY

                 The bucket owner has read-only access to the objects. The up-
                 loading account retains ownership of the objects.
                     FULL

                 The  bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object own-
                 ership is determined by the following criteria:

                 o If the bucket is configured with the Bucket owner preferred
                   setting,  the  bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading
                   account  will  have  object  access  as  specified  by  the
                   bucket's policy.

                 o Otherwise,  the  uploading account retains ownership of the
                   objects.

                 For more information about Amazon S3  object  ownership,  see
                 Controlling  ownership  of  uploaded  objects using S3 Object
                 Ownership in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide .

       --file-system-locations (list)
          An array of ProjectFileSystemLocation objects for a CodeBuild  build
          project. A ProjectFileSystemLocation object specifies the identifier
          , location , mountOptions , mountPoint , and type of a  file  system
          created using Amazon Elastic File System.

          (structure)
              Information  about  a file system created by Amazon Elastic File
              System (EFS). For more information, see What Is  Amazon  Elastic
              File System?

              type -> (string)
                 The type of the file system. The one supported type is EFS .

              location -> (string)
                 A  string that specifies the location of the file system cre-
                 ated  by  Amazon  EFS.  Its  format  is  efs-dns-name:/direc-
                 tory-path . You can find the DNS name of file system when you
                 view it in the Amazon EFS console. The directory  path  is  a
                 path to a directory in the file system that CodeBuild mounts.
                 For  example,  if  the  DNS  name  of  a   file   system   is
                 fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com  ,  and its mount di-
                 rectory is my-efs-mount-directory  ,  then  the  location  is
                 fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:/my-efs-mount-direc-
                 tory .

                 The directory path in the format efs-dns-name:/directory-path
                 is  optional. If you do not specify a directory path, the lo-
                 cation is only the DNS name and CodeBuild mounts  the  entire
                 file system.

              mountPoint -> (string)
                 The  location  in the container where you mount the file sys-
                 tem.

              identifier -> (string)
                 The name used to access a file system created by Amazon  EFS.
                 CodeBuild  creates  an  environment variable by appending the
                 identifier in all capital letters to CODEBUILD_ .  For  exam-
                 ple, if you specify my_efs for identifier , a new environment
                 variable is create named CODEBUILD_MY_EFS .

                 The identifier is used to mount your file system.

              mountOptions -> (string)
                 The mount options for a file system created  by  Amazon  EFS.
                 The   default   mount   options   used   by   CodeBuild   are
                 nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,re-
                 trans=2 . For more information, see Recommended NFS Mount Op-

          batchReportMode -> (string)
              Specifies how build  status  reports  are  sent  to  the  source
              provider  for  the  batch build. This property is only used when
              the source provider for your project is  Bitbucket,  GitHub,  or
              GitHub  Enterprise,  and  your  project  is configured to report
              build statuses to the source provider.

          The  maximum  number  of concurrent builds that are allowed for this
          project.

          New builds are only started if the current number of builds is  less
          than  or  equal to this limit. If the current build count meets this
          limit, new builds are throttled and are not run.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To create an AWS CodeBuild build project

       The following create-project example creates a CodeBuild build  project
       using source files from an S3 bucket

          aws codebuild create-project \
              --name "my-demo-project" \
              --source "{\"type\": \"S3\",\"location\": \"codebuild-us-west-2-123456789012-input-bucket/my-source.zip\"}" \
              --artifacts {"\"type\": \"S3\",\"location\": \"codebuild-us-west-2-123456789012-output-bucket\""} \
              --environment "{\"type\": \"LINUX_CONTAINER\",\"image\": \"aws/codebuild/standard:1.0\",\"computeType\": \"BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL\"}" \
              --service-role "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/service-role/my-codebuild-service-role"

       Example  2: To create an AWS CodeBuild build project using a JSON input
       file for the parameters

       The following create-project example creates a CodeBuild build  project
       by  passing all of the required parameters in a JSON input file. Create
       the input file template by running the command with only  the  --gener-
       ate-cli-skeleton parameter.

          aws codebuild create-project --cli-input-json file://create-project.json

       The input JSON file create-project.json contains the following content:

          {
              "name": "codebuild-demo-project",
              "source": {
                  "type": "S3",
                  "location": "codebuild-region-ID-account-ID-input-bucket/MessageUtil.zip"
              },
              "artifacts": {
                  "type": "S3",
                  "location": "codebuild-region-ID-account-ID-output-bucket"
              },
              "environment": {
                  "type": "LINUX_CONTAINER",
                  "image": "aws/codebuild/standard:1.0",
                  "computeType": "BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL"
              },
              "serviceRole": "serviceIAMRole"
          }

       Output:

          {
              "project": {
                  "name": "codebuild-demo-project",
                  "serviceRole": "serviceIAMRole",
                  "tags": [],

                  "arn": "arn:aws:codebuild:region-ID:account-ID:project/codebuild-demo-project"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       project -> (structure)
          Information about the build project that was created.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the build project.

          arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the build project.

          description -> (string)
              A description that makes the build project easy to identify.

          source -> (structure)
              Information about the build input source  code  for  this  build
              project.

              type -> (string)
                 The  type  of  repository that contains the source code to be
                 built. Valid values include:

                 o BITBUCKET : The source code is in a Bitbucket repository.

                 o CODECOMMIT : The source code is in  an  CodeCommit  reposi-
                   tory.

                 o CODEPIPELINE  :  The  source code settings are specified in
                   the source action of a pipeline in CodePipeline.

                 o GITHUB : The source code is in a GitHub  or  GitHub  Enter-
                   prise Cloud repository.

                 o GITHUB_ENTERPRISE  :  The source code is in a GitHub Enter-
                   prise Server repository.

                 o NO_SOURCE : The project does not have input source code.

                 o S3 : The source code is in an Amazon S3 bucket.

              location -> (string)
                 Information about the location  of  the  source  code  to  be
                 built. Valid values include:

                 o For  source  code settings that are specified in the source
                   action of a pipeline in CodePipeline, location  should  not
                   be  specified. If it is specified, CodePipeline ignores it.
                   This is because CodePipeline uses the settings in  a  pipe-
                   line's source action instead of this value.

                 o For  source  code  in  an  CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS
                   clone URL to the repository that contains the  source  code
                   and  the  buildspec file (for example, https://git-codecom-
                   mit.<region-ID>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/<repo-name> ).

                 o For source code in an Amazon S3 input bucket,  one  of  the
                   following.

                   o The  path  to  the ZIP file that contains the source code
                     (for example, <bucket-name>/<path>/<object-name>.zip ).

                   o The path to the folder that contains the source code (for
                     example, <bucket-name>/<path-to-source-code>/<folder>/ ).

                 o For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL
                   to the repository that contains the source and  the  build-
                   spec  file.  You  must connect your Amazon Web Services ac-
                   count to your GitHub account. Use the CodeBuild console  to
                   start creating a build project. When you use the console to
                   connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub Authorize
                   application  page, for Organization access , choose Request
                   access next to each repository you want to allow  CodeBuild
                   to  have access to, and then choose Authorize application .
                   (After you have connected to your GitHub  account,  you  do
                   not  need  to  finish  creating  the build project. You can
                   leave the CodeBuild console.) To instruct CodeBuild to  use
                   this  connection,  in  the  source object, set the auth ob-
                   ject's type value to OAUTH .

                 o For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS  clone
                   URL  to  the  repository  that  contains the source and the
                   buildspec file. You must connect your Amazon  Web  Services
                   account  to  your Bitbucket account. Use the CodeBuild con-
                   sole to start creating a build project. When  you  use  the
                   console  to  connect  (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the
                   Bitbucket Confirm access to your account page, choose Grant
                   access  .  (After  you have connected to your Bitbucket ac-
                   count, you  do  not  need  to  finish  creating  the  build
                   project.  You can leave the CodeBuild console.) To instruct
                   CodeBuild to use this connection, in the source object, set
                   the auth object's type value to OAUTH .

                 If  you  specify  CODEPIPELINE  for  the Type property, don't
                 specify this property. For all of the other types,  you  must
                 specify Location .

              gitCloneDepth -> (integer)
                 Information about the Git clone depth for the build project.

              gitSubmodulesConfig -> (structure)
                 Information  about  the  Git submodules configuration for the
                 build project.

                 fetchSubmodules -> (boolean)
                     Set to true to fetch Git submodules  for  your  CodeBuild
                     build project.

              buildspec -> (string)
                 The  buildspec file declaration to use for the builds in this
                 build project.

                 If this value is set, it can be either  an  inline  buildspec
                 definition,  the path to an alternate buildspec file relative
                 to the value of the  built-in  CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR  environment
                 variable,  or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in
                 the same Amazon Web Services Region  as  the  build  project.
                 Specify  the  buildspec  file  using  its  ARN  (for example,
                 arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml  ).  If  this
                 value  is  not  provided  or  is  set to an empty string, the
                 source code must contain a buildspec file in its root  direc-
                 tory. For more information, see Buildspec File Name and Stor-
                 age Location .

              auth -> (structure)
                 Information about the authorization settings for CodeBuild to
                 access the source code to be built.

                 This  information  is  for  the CodeBuild console's use only.
                 Your code should not get or set this information directly.

                 type -> (string)

                     NOTE:
                        This data type is deprecated and is no longer accurate
                        or used.

                     The  authorization  type  to use. The only valid value is
                     OAUTH , which represents the OAuth authorization type.

                 resource -> (string)
                     The resource value that applies to the  specified  autho-
                     rization type.

              reportBuildStatus -> (boolean)
                 Set  to true to report the status of a build's start and fin-
                 ish to your source provider. This option is valid  only  when
                 your  source  provider  is GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bit-
                 bucket. If this  is  set  and  you  use  a  different  source
                 provider, an invalidInputException is thrown.

                 To be able to report the build status to the source provider,
                 the user associated with the source provider must have  write
                 access  to  the repo. If the user does not have write access,
                 the build status cannot be updated. For more information, see
                 Source provider access in the CodeBuild User Guide .

                 The  status  of  a build triggered by a webhook is always re-
                 ported to your source provider.

                 If your project's builds are triggered by a webhook, you must
                 push  a  new commit to the repo for a change to this property
                 to take effect.

              buildStatusConfig -> (structure)
                 Contains information that defines how the build  project  re-
                 ports the build status to the source provider. This option is
                 only used when the source provider is GITHUB ,  GITHUB_ENTER-
                 PRISE , or BITBUCKET .

                 context -> (string)
                     Specifies the context of the build status CodeBuild sends
                     to the source provider. The usage of this  parameter  de-
                     pends on the source provider.
                        Bitbucket

                     This parameter is used for the name parameter in the Bit-
                     bucket commit status. For more information, see build  in
                     the Bitbucket API documentation.
                        GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server

                     This  parameter  is used for the context parameter in the
                     GitHub commit status. For more information, see Create  a
                     commit status in the GitHub developer guide.

                 targetUrl -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  target  url of the build status CodeBuild
                     sends to the source provider. The usage of this parameter
                     depends on the source provider.
                        Bitbucket

                     This  parameter is used for the url parameter in the Bit-
                     bucket commit status. For more information, see build  in
                     the Bitbucket API documentation.
                        GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server

                     This  parameter  is  used for the target_url parameter in
                     the GitHub  commit  status.  For  more  information,  see
                     Create a commit status in the GitHub developer guide.

              insecureSsl -> (boolean)
                 Enable  this  flag to ignore SSL warnings while connecting to
                 the project source code.

              sourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 An identifier for this project  source.  The  identifier  can
                 only  contain  alphanumeric  characters  and underscores, and
                 must be less than 128 characters in length.

          secondarySources -> (list)
              An array of ProjectSource objects.

              (structure)
                 Information about the build input source code for  the  build
                 project.

                 type -> (string)
                     The  type  of repository that contains the source code to
                     be built. Valid values include:

                     o BITBUCKET : The source code is in a  Bitbucket  reposi-
                       tory.

                     o CODECOMMIT : The source code is in an CodeCommit repos-
                       itory.

                     o CODEPIPELINE : The source code settings  are  specified
                       in the source action of a pipeline in CodePipeline.

                     o GITHUB  :  The source code is in a GitHub or GitHub En-
                       terprise Cloud repository.

                     o GITHUB_ENTERPRISE : The source code is in a GitHub  En-
                       terprise Server repository.

                     o NO_SOURCE  :  The  project  does  not have input source
                       code.

                     o S3 : The source code is in an Amazon S3 bucket.

                 location -> (string)
                     Information about the location of the source code  to  be
                     built. Valid values include:

                     o For  source  code  settings  that  are specified in the
                       source action of a pipeline in  CodePipeline,  location
                       should  not  be  specified.  If  it is specified, Code-
                       Pipeline ignores it. This is because CodePipeline  uses
                       the  settings  in a pipeline's source action instead of
                       this value.

                     o For source code in an CodeCommit repository, the  HTTPS
                       clone  URL  to  the repository that contains the source
                       code   and   the   buildspec   file    (for    example,
                       https://git-codecommit.<region-ID>.amazonaws.com/v1/re-
                       pos/<repo-name> ).

                     o For source code in an Amazon S3 input  bucket,  one  of
                       the following.

                       o The  path  to  the  ZIP file that contains the source
                         code    (for    example,    <bucket-name>/<path>/<ob-
                         ject-name>.zip ).

                       o The  path to the folder that contains the source code
                         (for                                         example,
                         <bucket-name>/<path-to-source-code>/<folder>/ ).

                     o For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone
                       URL to the repository that contains the source and  the
                       buildspec  file.  You must connect your Amazon Web Ser-
                       vices account to your GitHub account. Use the CodeBuild
                       console to start creating a build project. When you use
                       the console to connect (or reconnect) with  GitHub,  on
                       the GitHub Authorize application page, for Organization
                       access , choose Request access next to each  repository
                       you want to allow CodeBuild to have access to, and then
                       choose Authorize application .  (After  you  have  con-
                       nected  to your GitHub account, you do not need to fin-
                       ish creating the build project. You can leave the Code-
                       Build  console.) To instruct CodeBuild to use this con-
                       nection, in the source object, set  the  auth  object's
                       type value to OAUTH .

                     o For  source  code  in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS
                       clone URL to the repository that  contains  the  source
                       and  the  buildspec  file. You must connect your Amazon
                       Web Services account to your Bitbucket account. Use the
                       CodeBuild  console  to  start creating a build project.
                       When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with
                       Bitbucket,  on the Bitbucket Confirm access to your ac-
                       count page, choose Grant access . (After you have  con-
                       nected  to  your  Bitbucket account, you do not need to
                       finish creating the build project. You  can  leave  the
                       CodeBuild  console.)  To instruct CodeBuild to use this
                       connection, in the source object, set the auth object's
                       type value to OAUTH .

                     If  you specify CODEPIPELINE for the Type property, don't
                     specify this property. For all of the  other  types,  you
                     must specify Location .

                 gitCloneDepth -> (integer)
                     Information  about  the  Git  clone  depth  for the build
                     project.

                 gitSubmodulesConfig -> (structure)
                     Information about the Git  submodules  configuration  for
                     the build project.

                     fetchSubmodules -> (boolean)
                        Set to true to fetch Git submodules for your CodeBuild
                        build project.

                 buildspec -> (string)
                     The buildspec file declaration to use for the  builds  in
                     this build project.

                     If  this  value is set, it can be either an inline build-
                     spec definition, the path to an alternate buildspec  file
                     relative  to  the value of the built-in CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR
                     environment variable, or the path to an  S3  bucket.  The
                     bucket  must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region as
                     the build project. Specify the buildspec file  using  its
                     ARN    (for    example,    arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sam-
                     ple2/buildspec.yml ). If this value is not provided or is
                     set  to  an  empty string, the source code must contain a
                     buildspec file in its root directory. For  more  informa-
                     tion, see Buildspec File Name and Storage Location .

                 auth -> (structure)
                     Information  about  the  authorization settings for Code-
                     Build to access the source code to be built.

                     This information is for the CodeBuild console's use only.
                     Your  code  should  not  get  or set this information di-
                     rectly.

                     type -> (string)

                        NOTE:
                            This data type is deprecated and is no longer  ac-
                            curate or used.

                        The authorization type to use. The only valid value is
                        OAUTH , which represents the OAuth authorization type.

                     resource -> (string)
                        The resource value that applies to the  specified  au-
                        thorization type.

                 reportBuildStatus -> (boolean)
                     Set  to  true to report the status of a build's start and
                     finish to your source provider. This option is valid only
                     when  your  source provider is GitHub, GitHub Enterprise,
                     or Bitbucket. If this is set  and  you  use  a  different
                     source provider, an invalidInputException is thrown.

                     To  be  able  to  report  the  build status to the source
                     provider, the user associated with  the  source  provider
                     must  have write access to the repo. If the user does not
                     have write access, the build status  cannot  be  updated.
                     For  more  information, see Source provider access in the
                     CodeBuild User Guide .

                     The status of a build triggered by a  webhook  is  always
                     reported to your source provider.

                     If  your project's builds are triggered by a webhook, you
                     must push a new commit to the repo for a change  to  this
                     property to take effect.

                 buildStatusConfig -> (structure)
                     Contains  information  that defines how the build project
                     reports the build status to the source provider. This op-
                     tion  is  only  used when the source provider is GITHUB ,
                     GITHUB_ENTERPRISE , or BITBUCKET .

                     context -> (string)
                        Specifies the context of the  build  status  CodeBuild
                        sends to the source provider. The usage of this param-
                        eter depends on the source provider.
                            Bitbucket

                        This parameter is used for the name parameter  in  the
                        Bitbucket  commit  status.  For  more information, see
                        build in the Bitbucket API documentation.
                            GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server

                        This parameter is used for the  context  parameter  in
                        the  GitHub  commit  status. For more information, see
                        Create a commit status in the GitHub developer guide.

                     targetUrl -> (string)
                        Specifies the target url of the build status CodeBuild
                        sends to the source provider. The usage of this param-
                        eter depends on the source provider.
                            Bitbucket

                        This parameter is used for the url  parameter  in  the
                        Bitbucket  commit  status.  For  more information, see
                        build in the Bitbucket API documentation.
                            GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server

                        This parameter is used for the target_url parameter in
                        the  GitHub  commit  status. For more information, see
                        Create a commit status in the GitHub developer guide.

                 insecureSsl -> (boolean)
                     Enable this flag to ignore SSL warnings while  connecting
                     to the project source code.

                 sourceIdentifier -> (string)
                     An identifier for this project source. The identifier can
                     only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores, and
                     must be less than 128 characters in length.

          sourceVersion -> (string)
              A  version  of  the build input to be built for this project. If
              not specified, the latest version is used. If specified, it must
              be one of:

              o For CodeCommit: the commit ID, branch, or Git tag to use.

              o For  GitHub:  the  commit ID, pull request ID, branch name, or
                tag name that corresponds to the version of  the  source  code
                you  want to build. If a pull request ID is specified, it must
                use the format pr/pull-request-ID (for example pr/25 ).  If  a
                branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used.
                If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

              o For Bitbucket: the commit ID, branch name, or  tag  name  that
                corresponds  to  the  version  of  the source code you want to
                build. If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit
                ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit
                ID is used.

              o For Amazon S3: the version ID of the  object  that  represents
                the build input ZIP file to use.

              If sourceVersion is specified at the build level, then that ver-
              sion takes precedence over this sourceVersion  (at  the  project
              level).

              For  more  information, see Source Version Sample with CodeBuild
              in the CodeBuild User Guide .

          secondarySourceVersions -> (list)
              An array of ProjectSourceVersion objects. If secondarySourceVer-
              sions is specified at the build level, then they take over these
              secondarySourceVersions (at the project level).

              (structure)
                 A source identifier and its corresponding version.

                 sourceIdentifier -> (string)
                     An identifier for a source  in  the  build  project.  The
                     identifier  can  only contain alphanumeric characters and
                     underscores, and must be  less  than  128  characters  in
                     length.

                 sourceVersion -> (string)
                     The  source  version for the corresponding source identi-
                     fier. If specified, must be one of:

                     o For CodeCommit: the commit ID, branch, or  Git  tag  to
                       use.

                     o For  GitHub:  the  commit  ID,  pull request ID, branch
                       name, or tag name that corresponds to  the  version  of
                       the source code you want to build. If a pull request ID
                       is specified, it must use the format pr/pull-request-ID
                       (for  example,  pr/25 ). If a branch name is specified,
                       the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not  specified,
                       the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

                     o For  Bitbucket: the commit ID, branch name, or tag name
                       that corresponds to the version of the source code  you
                       want  to  build.  If  a  branch  name is specified, the
                       branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified,  the
                       default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

                     o For Amazon S3: the version ID of the object that repre-
                       sents the build input ZIP file to use.

                     For more information,  see  Source  Version  Sample  with
                     CodeBuild in the CodeBuild User Guide .

          artifacts -> (structure)
              Information  about  the  build  output  artifacts  for the build
              project.

              type -> (string)
                 The type of build output artifact. Valid values include:

                 o CODEPIPELINE : The build project has build output generated
                   through CodePipeline.

                 NOTE:
                     The CODEPIPELINE type is not supported for secondaryArti-
                     facts .

                 o NO_ARTIFACTS : The build project does not produce any build
                   output.

                 o S3 : The build project stores build output in Amazon S3.

              location -> (string)
                 Information about the build output artifact location:

                 o If  type is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores this
                   value if specified. This is  because  CodePipeline  manages
                   its build output locations instead of CodeBuild.

                 o If  type  is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored if
                   specified, because no build output is produced.

                 o If type is set to S3 , this  is  the  name  of  the  output
                   bucket.

              path -> (string)
                 Along  with  namespaceType  and name , the pattern that Code-
                 Build uses to name and store the output artifact:

                 o If type is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores  this
                   value  if  specified.  This is because CodePipeline manages
                   its build output names instead of CodeBuild.

                 o If type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is  ignored  if
                   specified, because no build output is produced.

                 o If type is set to S3 , this is the path to the output arti-
                   fact. If path is not specified, path is not used.

                 For example, if path is set to MyArtifacts , namespaceType is
                 set  to NONE , and name is set to MyArtifact.zip , the output
                 artifact  is  stored  in  the  output   bucket   at   MyArti-
                 facts/MyArtifact.zip .

              namespaceType -> (string)
                 Along with path and name , the pattern that CodeBuild uses to
                 determine the name and location to store the output artifact:

                 o If type is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores  this
                   value  if  specified.  This is because CodePipeline manages
                   its build output names instead of CodeBuild.

                 o If type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is  ignored  if
                   specified, because no build output is produced.

                 o If type is set to S3 , valid values include:

                   o BUILD_ID  :  Include  the build ID in the location of the
                     build output artifact.

                   o NONE : Do not include the build ID. This is  the  default
                     if namespaceType is not specified.

                 For example, if path is set to MyArtifacts , namespaceType is
                 set to BUILD_ID , and name is set  to  MyArtifact.zip  ,  the
                 output  artifact  is stored in MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArti-
                 fact.zip .

              name -> (string)
                 Along with path and namespaceType , the  pattern  that  Code-
                 Build uses to name and store the output artifact:

                 o If  type is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores this
                   value if specified. This is  because  CodePipeline  manages
                   its build output names instead of CodeBuild.

                 o If  type  is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored if
                   specified, because no build output is produced.

                 o If type is set to S3 , this is the name of the output arti-
                   fact  object.  If  you  set  the name to be a forward slash
                   ("/"), the artifact is stored in the  root  of  the  output
                   bucket.

                 For example:

                 o If  path  is  set  to MyArtifacts , namespaceType is set to
                   BUILD_ID , and name is set to  MyArtifact.zip  ,  then  the
                   output artifact is stored in MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArti-
                   fact.zip .

                 o If path is empty, namespaceType is set to NONE ,  and  name
                   is  set  to "/ ", the output artifact is stored in the root
                   of the output bucket.

                 o If path is set to MyArtifacts ,  namespaceType  is  set  to
                   BUILD_ID  , and name is set to "/ ", the output artifact is
                   stored in MyArtifacts/<build-ID> .

              packaging -> (string)
                 The type of build output artifact to create:

                 o If type is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores  this
                   value  if  specified.  This is because CodePipeline manages
                   its build output artifacts instead of CodeBuild.

                 o If type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is  ignored  if
                   specified, because no build output is produced.

                 o If type is set to S3 , valid values include:

                   o NONE  :  CodeBuild  creates in the output bucket a folder
                     that contains the build output. This is  the  default  if
                     packaging is not specified.

                   o ZIP  :  CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a ZIP file
                     that contains the build output.

              overrideArtifactName -> (boolean)
                 If this flag is set, a name specified in the  buildspec  file
                 overrides  the  artifact name. The name specified in a build-
                 spec file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Com-
                 mand Language. For example, you can append a date and time to
                 your artifact name so that it is always unique.

              encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                 Set to true if you do not  want  your  output  artifacts  en-
                 crypted.  This option is valid only if your artifacts type is
                 Amazon S3. If this is set with another artifacts type, an in-
                 validInputException is thrown.

              artifactIdentifier -> (string)
                 An identifier for this artifact definition.

              bucketOwnerAccess -> (string)
                 Specifies  the bucket owner's access for objects that another
                 account uploads to their Amazon S3 bucket. By  default,  only
                 the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access
                 to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket
                 owner access to these objects.

                 NOTE:
                     To  use  this  property, your CodeBuild service role must
                     have the s3:PutBucketAcl permission. This permission  al-
                     lows  CodeBuild to modify the access control list for the
                     bucket.

                 This property can be one of the following values:
                     NONE

                 The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is
                 the default.
                     READ_ONLY

                 The bucket owner has read-only access to the objects. The up-
                 loading account retains ownership of the objects.
                     FULL

                 The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object  own-
                 ership is determined by the following criteria:

                 o If the bucket is configured with the Bucket owner preferred
                   setting, the bucket owner owns the objects.  The  uploading
                   account  will  have  object  access  as  specified  by  the
                   bucket's policy.

                 o Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership  of  the
                   objects.

                 For  more  information  about Amazon S3 object ownership, see
                 Controlling ownership of uploaded  objects  using  S3  Object
                 Ownership in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide .

          secondaryArtifacts -> (list)
              An array of ProjectArtifacts objects.

              (structure)
                 Information  about  the  build output artifacts for the build
                 project.

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of build output artifact. Valid values include:

                     o CODEPIPELINE : The build project has build output  gen-
                       erated through CodePipeline.

                     NOTE:
                        The  CODEPIPELINE  type is not supported for secondar-
                        yArtifacts .

                     o NO_ARTIFACTS : The build project does not  produce  any
                       build output.

                     o S3  :  The  build project stores build output in Amazon
                       S3.

                 location -> (string)
                     Information about the build output artifact location:

                     o If type is set to CODEPIPELINE ,  CodePipeline  ignores
                       this  value  if specified. This is because CodePipeline
                       manages its build output  locations  instead  of  Code-
                       Build.

                     o If  type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored
                       if specified, because no build output is produced.

                     o If type is set to S3 , this is the name of  the  output
                       bucket.

                 path -> (string)
                     Along  with  namespaceType  and  name  , the pattern that
                     CodeBuild uses to name and store the output artifact:

                     o If type is set to CODEPIPELINE ,  CodePipeline  ignores
                       this  value  if specified. This is because CodePipeline
                       manages its build output names instead of CodeBuild.

                     o If type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is  ignored
                       if specified, because no build output is produced.

                     o If  type  is set to S3 , this is the path to the output
                       artifact. If path is not specified, path is not used.

                     For example, if path is set to MyArtifacts  ,  namespace-
                     Type is set to NONE , and name is set to MyArtifact.zip ,
                     the output artifact is stored in  the  output  bucket  at
                     MyArtifacts/MyArtifact.zip .

                 namespaceType -> (string)
                     Along  with  path  and  name , the pattern that CodeBuild
                     uses to determine the name and location to store the out-
                     put artifact:

                     o If  type  is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores
                       this value if specified. This is  because  CodePipeline
                       manages its build output names instead of CodeBuild.

                     o If  type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored
                       if specified, because no build output is produced.

                     o If type is set to S3 , valid values include:

                       o BUILD_ID : Include the build ID in  the  location  of
                         the build output artifact.

                       o NONE  :  Do not include the build ID. This is the de-
                         fault if namespaceType is not specified.

                     For example, if path is set to MyArtifacts  ,  namespace-
                     Type  is  set  to  BUILD_ID  , and name is set to MyArti-
                     fact.zip , the  output  artifact  is  stored  in  MyArti-
                     facts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip .

                 name -> (string)
                     Along  with  path  and  namespaceType  , the pattern that
                     CodeBuild uses to name and store the output artifact:

                     o If type is set to CODEPIPELINE ,  CodePipeline  ignores
                       this  value  if specified. This is because CodePipeline
                       manages its build output names instead of CodeBuild.

                     o If type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is  ignored
                       if specified, because no build output is produced.

                     o If  type  is set to S3 , this is the name of the output
                       artifact object. If you set the name to  be  a  forward
                       slash  ("/"), the artifact is stored in the root of the
                       output bucket.

                     For example:

                     o If path is set to MyArtifacts , namespaceType is set to
                       BUILD_ID , and name is set to MyArtifact.zip , then the
                       output    artifact     is     stored     in     MyArti-
                       facts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip .

                     o If  path  is  empty, namespaceType is set to NONE , and
                       name is set to "/ ", the output artifact is  stored  in
                       the root of the output bucket.

                     o If path is set to MyArtifacts , namespaceType is set to
                       BUILD_ID , and name is set to "/ ", the output artifact
                       is stored in MyArtifacts/<build-ID> .

                 packaging -> (string)
                     The type of build output artifact to create:

                     o If  type  is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores
                       this value if specified. This is  because  CodePipeline
                       manages  its  build  output  artifacts instead of Code-
                       Build.

                     o If type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is  ignored
                       if specified, because no build output is produced.

                     o If type is set to S3 , valid values include:

                       o NONE  :  CodeBuild  creates  in  the  output bucket a
                         folder that contains the build output.  This  is  the
                         default if packaging is not specified.

                       o ZIP  :  CodeBuild  creates in the output bucket a ZIP
                         file that contains the build output.

                 overrideArtifactName -> (boolean)
                     If this flag is set, a name specified  in  the  buildspec
                     file overrides the artifact name. The name specified in a
                     buildspec file is calculated at build time and  uses  the
                     Shell  Command  Language.  For  example, you can append a
                     date and time to your artifact name so that it is  always
                     unique.

                 encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                     Set  to true if you do not want your output artifacts en-
                     crypted. This option is valid only if your artifacts type
                     is Amazon S3. If this is set with another artifacts type,
                     an invalidInputException is thrown.

                 artifactIdentifier -> (string)
                     An identifier for this artifact definition.

                 bucketOwnerAccess -> (string)
                     Specifies the bucket owner's access for objects that  an-
                     other  account  uploads to their Amazon S3 bucket. By de-
                     fault, only the account that uploads the objects  to  the
                     bucket  has access to these objects. This property allows
                     you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

                     NOTE:
                        To use this property, your CodeBuild service role must
                        have  the  s3:PutBucketAcl permission. This permission
                        allows CodeBuild to modify the access control list for
                        the bucket.

                     This property can be one of the following values:
                        NONE

                     The  bucket  owner  does  not have access to the objects.
                     This is the default.
                        READ_ONLY

                     The bucket owner has read-only access to the objects. The
                     uploading account retains ownership of the objects.
                        FULL

                     The  bucket  owner has full access to the objects. Object
                     ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                     o If the bucket is configured with the Bucket owner  pre-
                       ferred  setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The
                       uploading account will have object access as  specified
                       by the bucket's policy.

                     o Otherwise,  the  uploading account retains ownership of
                       the objects.

          cache -> (structure)
              Information about the cache for the build project.

              type -> (string)
                 The type of cache used by the build project. Valid values in-
                 clude:

                 o NO_CACHE : The build project does not use any cache.

                 o S3 : The build project reads and writes from and to S3.

                 o LOCAL : The build project stores a cache locally on a build
                   host that is only available to that build host.

              location -> (string)
                 Information about the cache location:

                 o NO_CACHE or LOCAL : This value is ignored.

                 o S3 : This is the S3 bucket name/prefix.

              modes -> (list)
                 An  array  of strings that specify the local cache modes. You
                 can use one or more local cache modes at the same time.  This
                 is only used for LOCAL cache types.

                 Possible values are:
                     LOCAL_SOURCE_CACHE

                 Caches  Git metadata for primary and secondary sources. After
                 the cache is created, subsequent builds pull only the  change
                 between commits. This mode is a good choice for projects with
                 a clean working directory and a source that is  a  large  Git
                 repository.  If  you choose this option and your project does
                 not use a Git repository (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or  Bit-
                 bucket), the option is ignored.
                     LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE

                 Caches existing Docker layers. This mode is a good choice for
                 projects that build or pull large Docker images. It can  pre-
                 vent  the  performance  issues caused by pulling large Docker
                 images down from the network.

                 NOTE:

                     o You can use a Docker layer cache in the Linux  environ-
                       ment only.

                     o The  privileged  flag  must be set so that your project
                       has the required Docker permissions.

                     o You should consider the  security  implications  before
                       you use a Docker layer cache.

                     LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE

                 Caches  directories  you  specify in the buildspec file. This
                 mode is a good choice if your build scenario is not suited to
                 one of the other three local cache modes. If you use a custom
                 cache:

                 o Only directories can be specified for caching.  You  cannot
                   specify individual files.

                 o Symlinks are used to reference cached directories.

                 o Cached directories are linked to your build before it down-
                   loads its project sources. Cached items are overridden if a
                   source  item  has  the same name. Directories are specified
                   using cache paths in the buildspec file.

                 For more information, see Build Environment Compute Types  in
                 the CodeBuild User Guide.

              environmentVariables -> (list)
                 A  set  of  environment variables to make available to builds
                 for this build project.

                 (structure)
                     Information about an environment  variable  for  a  build
                     project or a build.

                     name -> (string)
                        The name or key of the environment variable.

                     value -> (string)
                        The value of the environment variable.

                        WARNING:
                            We  strongly discourage the use of PLAINTEXT envi-
                            ronment variables to store sensitive values, espe-
                            cially  Amazon Web Services secret key IDs and se-
                            cret access keys. PLAINTEXT environment  variables
                            can be displayed in plain text using the CodeBuild
                            console and the CLI. For sensitive values, we rec-
                            ommend you use an environment variable of type PA-
                            RAMETER_STORE or SECRETS_MANAGER .

                     type -> (string)
                        The type of environment  variable.  Valid  values  in-
                        clude:

                        o PARAMETER_STORE  : An environment variable stored in
                          Systems Manager Parameter Store.  To  learn  how  to
                          specify  a parameter store environment variable, see
                          env/parameter-store in the CodeBuild User Guide .

                        o PLAINTEXT : An environment variable  in  plain  text
                          format. This is the default value.

                        o SECRETS_MANAGER  : An environment variable stored in
                          Secrets Manager. To learn how to specify  a  secrets
                          manager        environment       variable,       see
                          env/secrets-manager in the CodeBuild User Guide .

              privilegedMode -> (boolean)
                 Enables running the Docker daemon inside a Docker  container.
                 Set to true only if the build project is used to build Docker
                 images. Otherwise, a build that attempts to interact with the
                 Docker daemon fails. The default setting is false .

                 You can initialize the Docker daemon during the install phase
                 of your build by adding one of the following sets of commands
                 to the install phase of your buildspec file:

                 If the operating system's base image is Ubuntu Linux:
                     -               nohup              /usr/local/bin/dockerd
                     --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock
                     --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&

                     -  timeout  15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep
                     1; done"

                 If the operating system's base image is Alpine Linux and  the
                 previous  command does not work, add the -t argument to time-
                 out :
                     -              nohup               /usr/local/bin/dockerd
                     --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock
                     --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&

                     - timeout -t 15 sh -c "until  docker  info;  do  echo  .;
                     sleep 1; done"

              certificate -> (string)
                 The  ARN of the Amazon S3 bucket, path prefix, and object key
                 that contains  the  PEM-encoded  certificate  for  the  build
                 project.  For  more information, see certificate in the Code-
                 Build User Guide .

              registryCredential -> (structure)
                 The credentials for access to a private registry.

                 credential -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  or  name  of  credentials
                     created using Secrets Manager.

                     NOTE:
                        The  credential  can  use  the name of the credentials
                        only if they exist in your current Amazon Web Services
                        Region.

                 credentialProvider -> (string)
                     The service that created the credentials to access a pri-
                     vate Docker registry. The valid  value,  SECRETS_MANAGER,
                     is for Secrets Manager.

              imagePullCredentialsType -> (string)
                 The type of credentials CodeBuild uses to pull images in your
                 build. There are two valid values:

                 o CODEBUILD specifies that CodeBuild  uses  its  own  creden-
                   tials.  This  requires  that you modify your ECR repository
                   policy to trust CodeBuild service principal.

                 o SERVICE_ROLE  specifies  that  CodeBuild  uses  your  build
                   project's service role.

                 When  you  use a cross-account or private registry image, you
                 must use SERVICE_ROLE credentials. When you use an  CodeBuild
                 curated image, you must use CODEBUILD credentials.

          serviceRole -> (string)
              The  ARN of the IAM role that enables CodeBuild to interact with
              dependent Amazon Web Services services on behalf of  the  Amazon
              Web Services account.

          timeoutInMinutes -> (integer)
              How  long, in minutes, from 5 to 480 (8 hours), for CodeBuild to
              wait before timing out any related build that did not get marked
              as completed. The default is 60 minutes.

          queuedTimeoutInMinutes -> (integer)
              The  number of minutes a build is allowed to be queued before it
              times out.

          encryptionKey -> (string)
              The Key Management Service customer master key (CMK) to be  used
              for encrypting the build output artifacts.

              NOTE:
                 You can use a cross-account KMS key to encrypt the build out-
                 put artifacts if your service role  has  permission  to  that
                 key.

              You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK
              or,  if  available,  the   CMK's   alias   (using   the   format
              alias/<alias-name>  ).  If  you don't specify a value, CodeBuild
              uses the managed CMK for Amazon Simple Storage  Service  (Amazon
              S3).

          tags -> (list)
              A  list  of  tag  key and value pairs associated with this build
              project.

              These tags are available for use by Amazon Web Services services
              that support CodeBuild build project tags.

              (structure)
                 A tag, consisting of a key and a value.

                 This tag is available for use by Amazon Web Services services
                 that support tags in CodeBuild.

                 key -> (string)
                     The tag's key.

                 value -> (string)
                     The tag's value.

          created -> (timestamp)
              When the build project was created, expressed in Unix time  for-
              mat.

          lastModified -> (timestamp)
              When  the build project's settings were last modified, expressed
              in Unix time format.

          webhook -> (structure)
              Information about a webhook that connects repository events to a
              build project in CodeBuild.

              url -> (string)
                 The URL to the webhook.

              payloadUrl -> (string)
                 The CodeBuild endpoint where webhook events are sent.

              secret -> (string)
                 The secret token of the associated repository.

                 NOTE:
                     A Bitbucket webhook does not support secret .

              branchFilter -> (string)
                 A  regular  expression  used  to  determine  which repository
                 branches are built when a webhook is triggered. If  the  name
                 of a branch matches the regular expression, then it is built.
                 If branchFilter is empty, then all branches are built.

                 NOTE:
                     It is recommended that you use  filterGroups  instead  of
                     branchFilter .

              filterGroups -> (list)
                 An array of arrays of WebhookFilter objects used to determine
                 which webhooks are triggered. At least one  WebhookFilter  in
                 the array must specify EVENT as its type .

                 For a build to be triggered, at least one filter group in the
                 filterGroups array must pass. For a  filter  group  to  pass,
                 each of its filters must pass.

                 (list)
                     (structure)
                        A  filter  used  to determine which webhooks trigger a
                        build.

                        type -> (string)
                            The type of webhook filter. There are six  webhook
                            filter  types: EVENT , ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID , HEAD_REF
                            , BASE_REF , FILE_PATH , and COMMIT_MESSAGE .
                               EVENT

                            A webhook event triggers a build when the provided
                            pattern  matches  one  of five event types: PUSH ,
                            PULL_REQUEST_CREATED  ,   PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED   ,
                            PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED  , and PULL_REQUEST_MERGED .
                            The EVENT patterns are specified as a  comma-sepa-
                            rated string. For example, PUSH, PULL_REQUEST_CRE-
                            ATED, PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED filters all push,  pull
                            request created, and pull request updated events.

                            NOTE:
                               The PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED works with GitHub and
                               GitHub Enterprise only.

                               ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID

                            A webhook event triggers a build  when  a  GitHub,
                            GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket account ID matches
                            the regular expression pattern .
                               HEAD_REF

                            A webhook event triggers a  build  when  the  head
                            reference matches the regular expression pattern .
                            For    example,     refs/heads/branch-name     and
                            refs/tags/tag-name .

                            Works  with  GitHub  and  GitHub  Enterprise push,
                            GitHub and GitHub Enterprise  pull  request,  Bit-
                            bucket push, and Bitbucket pull request events.
                               BASE_REF

                            A  webhook  event  triggers  a build when the base
                            reference matches the regular expression pattern .
                            For example, refs/heads/branch-name .

                            NOTE:
                               Works with pull request events only.

                               FILE_PATH

                            A  webhook  triggers  a  build  when the path of a
                            changed file matches the regular  expression  pat-
                            tern .

                            NOTE:
                               Works with GitHub and Bitbucket events push and
                               pull requests events. Also  works  with  GitHub
                               Enterprise  push events, but does not work with
                               GitHub Enterprise pull request events.

                               COMMIT_MESSAGE

                            A webhook triggers a build when  the  head  commit
                            message matches the regular expression pattern .

                            NOTE:
                               Works with GitHub and Bitbucket events push and
                               pull requests events. Also  works  with  GitHub
                               Enterprise  push events, but does not work with
                               GitHub Enterprise pull request events.

                        pattern -> (string)
                            For  a  WebHookFilter  that  uses  EVENT  type,  a
                            comma-separated  string that specifies one or more
                            events. For  example,  the  webhook  filter  PUSH,
                            PULL_REQUEST_CREATED,  PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED allows
                            all push, pull request created, and  pull  request
                            updated events to trigger a build.

                            For  a  WebHookFilter  that  uses any of the other
                            filter types, a regular  expression  pattern.  For
                            example,  a  WebHookFilter  that uses HEAD_REF for
                            its type and the pattern ^refs/heads/  triggers  a
                            build  when  the head reference is a branch with a
                            reference name refs/heads/branch-name .

                        excludeMatchedPattern -> (boolean)
                            Used to indicate that the pattern determines which
                            webhook  events  do  not trigger a build. If true,
                            then a webhook event that does not match the  pat-
                            tern  triggers  a  build. If false, then a webhook
                            event that matches the pattern triggers a build.

              buildType -> (string)
                 Specifies the type of build this webhook will trigger.

              lastModifiedSecret -> (timestamp)

              Information about the build badge for the build project.

              badgeEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Set  this  to  true to generate a publicly accessible URL for
                 your project's build badge.

              badgeRequestUrl -> (string)
                 The publicly-accessible URL through which you can access  the
                 build badge for your project.

          logsConfig -> (structure)
              Information about logs for the build project. A project can cre-
              ate logs in CloudWatch Logs, an S3 bucket, or both.

              cloudWatchLogs -> (structure)
                 Information about CloudWatch Logs for a build project. Cloud-
                 Watch Logs are enabled by default.

                 status -> (string)
                     The  current  status of the logs in CloudWatch Logs for a
                     build project. Valid values are:

              s3Logs -> (structure)
                 Information about logs built to an  S3  bucket  for  a  build
                 project. S3 logs are not enabled by default.

                 status -> (string)
                     The  current  status  of  the S3 build logs. Valid values
                     are:

                     o ENABLED : S3 build logs  are  enabled  for  this  build
                       project.

                     o DISABLED : S3 build logs are not enabled for this build
                       project.

                 location -> (string)
                     The ARN of an S3 bucket and the path prefix for S3  logs.
                     If  your  Amazon  S3  bucket name is my-bucket , and your
                     path prefix is build-log , then  acceptable  formats  are
                     my-bucket/build-log or arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/build-log .

                 encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                     Set  to  true if you do not want your S3 build log output
                     encrypted. By default S3 build logs are encrypted.

                 bucketOwnerAccess -> (string)
                     Specifies the bucket owner's access for objects that  an-
                     other  account  uploads to their Amazon S3 bucket. By de-
                     fault, only the account that uploads the objects  to  the
                     bucket  has access to these objects. This property allows
                     you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

                     NOTE:
                        To use this property, your CodeBuild service role must
                        have  the  s3:PutBucketAcl permission. This permission
                        allows CodeBuild to modify the access control list for
                        the bucket.

                     This property can be one of the following values:
                        NONE

                     The  bucket  owner  does  not have access to the objects.
                     This is the default.
                        READ_ONLY

                     The bucket owner has read-only access to the objects. The
                     uploading account retains ownership of the objects.
                        FULL

                     The  bucket  owner has full access to the objects. Object
                     ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                     o If the bucket is configured with the Bucket owner  pre-
                       ferred  setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The
                       uploading account will have object access as  specified
                       by the bucket's policy.

                     o Otherwise,  the  uploading account retains ownership of
                       the objects.

                     For more information about Amazon  S3  object  ownership,
                     see  Controlling  ownership  of uploaded objects using S3

          fileSystemLocations -> (list)
              An  array  of  ProjectFileSystemLocation objects for a CodeBuild
              build project. A ProjectFileSystemLocation object specifies  the
              identifier  , location , mountOptions , mountPoint , and type of
              a file system created using Amazon Elastic File System.

              (structure)
                 Information about a file system  created  by  Amazon  Elastic
                 File  System  (EFS). For more information, see What Is Amazon
                 Elastic File System?

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of the file system. The one  supported  type  is
                     EFS .

                 location -> (string)
                     A  string  that specifies the location of the file system
                     created by Amazon EFS. Its format is efs-dns-name:/direc-
                     tory-path . You can find the DNS name of file system when
                     you view it in the Amazon EFS console. The directory path
                     is  a  path  to a directory in the file system that Code-
                     Build mounts. For example, if the DNS name of a file sys-
                     tem  is fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com , and its
                     mount directory is my-efs-mount-directory , then the  lo-
                     cation        is        fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazon-
                     aws.com:/my-efs-mount-directory .

                     The directory path  in  the  format  efs-dns-name:/direc-
                     tory-path  is optional. If you do not specify a directory
                     path, the location is only the  DNS  name  and  CodeBuild
                     mounts the entire file system.

                 mountPoint -> (string)
                     The  location  in  the container where you mount the file
                     system.

                 identifier -> (string)
                     The name used to access a file system created  by  Amazon
                     EFS. CodeBuild creates an environment variable by append-
                     ing the identifier in all capital letters to CODEBUILD_ .
                     For example, if you specify my_efs for identifier , a new
                     environment variable is create named CODEBUILD_MY_EFS .

                     The identifier is used to mount your file system.

                 mountOptions -> (string)
                     The mount options for a file  system  created  by  Amazon
                     EFS.  The  default  mount  options  used by CodeBuild are
                     nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,re-
                     trans=2 . For more information, see Recommended NFS Mount
                     Options .

          buildBatchConfig -> (structure)
              A  ProjectBuildBatchConfig object that defines the  batch  build
              options for the project.

              serviceRole -> (string)
                 Specifies the service role ARN for the batch build project.

              combineArtifacts -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  if  the build artifacts for the batch build should
                 be combined into a single artifact location.

              restrictions -> (structure)
                 A BatchRestrictions object that  specifies  the  restrictions
                 for the batch build.

                 maximumBuildsAllowed -> (integer)
                     Specifies the maximum number of builds allowed.

                 computeTypesAllowed -> (list)
                     An  array  of strings that specify the compute types that
                     are allowed for the batch build.  See  Build  environment
                     compute  types in the CodeBuild User Guide for these val-
                     ues.

              timeoutInMins -> (integer)
                 Specifies the maximum amount of time, in  minutes,  that  the
                 batch build must be completed in.

              batchReportMode -> (string)
                 Specifies  how  build  status  reports are sent to the source
                 provider for the batch build. This property is only used when
                 the source provider for your project is Bitbucket, GitHub, or
                 GitHub Enterprise, and your project is configured  to  report
                 build statuses to the source provider.
                     REPORT_AGGREGATED_BATCH

                 (Default)  Aggregate  all of the build statuses into a single

              this project.

              New  builds  are only started if the current number of builds is
              less than or equal to this limit. If  the  current  build  count
              meets this limit, new builds are throttled and are not run.

          projectVisibility -> (string)
              Specifies  the visibility of the project's builds. Possible val-
              ues are:
