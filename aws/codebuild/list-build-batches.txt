LIST-BUILD-BATCHES()                                      LIST-BUILD-BATCHES()



NAME
       list-build-batches -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the identifiers of your build batches in the current region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-build-batches  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: ids

SYNOPSIS
            list-build-batches
          [--filter <value>]
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          A BuildBatchFilter object that specifies the filters for the search.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the batch builds to retrieve.  Only  batch  builds
              that have this status will be retrieved.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          status=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "status": "SUCCEEDED"|"FAILED"|"FAULT"|"TIMED_OUT"|"IN_PROGRESS"|"STOPPED"
          }

       --sort-order (string)
          Specifies  the  sort  order  of the returned items. Valid values in-
          clude:

          o ASCENDING : List the batch build identifiers in ascending order by
            identifier.

          o DESCENDING  : List the batch build identifiers in descending order
            by identifier.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list batch builds in AWS CodeBuild.

       The  following  list-build-batches  example  lists  the CodeBuild batch
       builds for the current account.

          aws codebuild list-build-batches

       Output:

          {
              "ids": [
                  "<project-name>:<batch-ID>",
                  "<project-name>:<batch-ID>"
              ]
          }

       For   more   information,   see   Batch   builds   in   AWS   CodeBuild
       <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/user-
       guide/batch-build.html>)__ in the AWS CodeBuild User Guide.

OUTPUT
       ids -> (list)
          An array of strings that contains the batch build identifiers.

          (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          If there are more items to return, this contains  a  token  that  is
          passed to a subsequent call to ListBuildBatches to retrieve the next
          set of items.
