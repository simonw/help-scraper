LIST-SHARED-PROJECTS()                                  LIST-SHARED-PROJECTS()



NAME
       list-shared-projects -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a list of projects that are shared with other Amazon Web Services
       accounts or users.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-shared-projects is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: projects

SYNOPSIS
            list-shared-projects
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --sort-by (string)
          The criterion to be used to list build projects shared with the cur-
          rent Amazon Web Services account or user. Valid values include:

          o ARN : List based on the ARN.

          o MODIFIED_TIME : List based on when information  about  the  shared
            project was last changed.

          Possible values:

          o ARN

          o MODIFIED_TIME

       --sort-order (string)
          The  order  in which to list shared build projects. Valid values in-
          clude:

          o ASCENDING : List in ascending order.

          o DESCENDING : List in descending order.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the shared project in AWS CodeBuild.

       The  following  list-shared-projects example lists the CodeBuild shared
       projects that are available to the current account.

          aws codebuild list-shared-projects

       Output:

          {
              "projects": [
                  "arn:aws:codebuild:<region-ID>:<account-ID>:project/<shared-project-name-1>",
                  "arn:aws:codebuild:<region-ID>:<account-ID>:project/<shared-project-name-2>"
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Working with shared projects in the AWS Code-
       Build User Guide.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          During  a previous call, the maximum number of items that can be re-
          turned is the value specified in maxResults . If there more items in
          the  list,  then  a unique string called a nextToken is returned. To
          get the next batch of items in the list, call this operation  again,
          adding  the  next  token to the call. To get all of the items in the
          list, keep calling this operation with each  subsequent  next  token
          that is returned, until no more next tokens are returned.

       projects -> (list)
          The list of ARNs for the build projects shared with the current Ama-
          zon Web Services account or user.

          (string)
