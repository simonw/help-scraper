LIST-SHARED-REPORT-GROUPS()                        LIST-SHARED-REPORT-GROUPS()



NAME
       list-shared-report-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of report groups that are shared with other Amazon Web Ser-
       vices accounts or users.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-shared-report-groups is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: reportGroups

SYNOPSIS
            list-shared-report-groups
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --sort-order (string)
          The  order  in  which to list shared report groups. Valid values in-
          clude:

          o ASCENDING : List in ascending order.

          o DESCENDING : List in descending order.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --sort-by (string)
          The criterion to be used to list report groups shared with the  cur-
          rent Amazon Web Services account or user. Valid values include:

          o ARN : List based on the ARN.

          o MODIFIED_TIME  :  List  based on when information about the shared
            report group was last changed.

          Possible values:

          o ARN

          o MODIFIED_TIME

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a list of the shared report group ARNs in AWS CodeBuild.

       The  following  list-shared-report-groups  example retrieves the report
       group ARNs for the account in the region.

          aws codebuild list-shared-report-groups

       Output:

          {
              "reportGroups": [
                  "arn:aws:codebuild:<region-ID>:<user-ID>:report-group/report-group-1",
                  "arn:aws:codebuild:<region-ID>:<user-ID>:report-group/report-group-2",
                  "arn:aws:codebuild:<region-ID>:<user-ID>:report-group/report-group-3"
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Working with report groups in the  AWS  Code-
       Build User Guide.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          During  a previous call, the maximum number of items that can be re-
          turned is the value specified in maxResults . If there more items in
          the  list,  then  a unique string called a nextToken is returned. To
          get the next batch of items in the list, call this operation  again,
          adding  the  next  token to the call. To get all of the items in the
          list, keep calling this operation with each  subsequent  next  token
          that is returned, until no more next tokens are returned.

       reportGroups -> (list)
          The  list of ARNs for the report groups shared with the current Ama-
          zon Web Services account or user.

          (string)
