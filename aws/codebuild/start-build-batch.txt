OPTIONS
       --project-name (string)
          The name of the project.

       --secondary-sources-override (list)
          An  array  of  ProjectSource  objects  that  override  the secondary
          sources defined in the batch build project.

          (structure)
              Information about the build input  source  code  for  the  build
              project.

              type -> (string)
                 The  type  of  repository that contains the source code to be
                 built. Valid values include:

                 o BITBUCKET : The source code is in a Bitbucket repository.

                 o CODECOMMIT : The source code is in  an  CodeCommit  reposi-
                   tory.

                 o CODEPIPELINE  :  The  source code settings are specified in
                   the source action of a pipeline in CodePipeline.

                 o GITHUB : The source code is in a GitHub  or  GitHub  Enter-
                   prise Cloud repository.

                 o GITHUB_ENTERPRISE  :  The source code is in a GitHub Enter-
                   prise Server repository.

                 o NO_SOURCE : The project does not have input source code.

                 o S3 : The source code is in an Amazon S3 bucket.

              location -> (string)
                 Information about the location  of  the  source  code  to  be
                 built. Valid values include:

                 o For  source  code settings that are specified in the source
                   action of a pipeline in CodePipeline, location  should  not
                   be  specified. If it is specified, CodePipeline ignores it.
                   This is because CodePipeline uses the settings in  a  pipe-
                   line's source action instead of this value.

                 o For  source  code  in  an  CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS
                   clone URL to the repository that contains the  source  code
                   and  the  buildspec file (for example, https://git-codecom-
                   mit.<region-ID>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/<repo-name> ).

                 o For source code in an Amazon S3 input bucket,  one  of  the
                   following.

                   o The  path  to  the ZIP file that contains the source code
                     (for example, <bucket-name>/<path>/<object-name>.zip ).

                   o The path to the folder that contains the source code (for
                     example, <bucket-name>/<path-to-source-code>/<folder>/ ).

                 o For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL
                   to the repository that contains the source and  the  build-
                   spec  file.  You  must connect your Amazon Web Services ac-
                   count to your GitHub account. Use the CodeBuild console  to
                   start creating a build project. When you use the console to
                   connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub Authorize
                   application  page, for Organization access , choose Request
                   access next to each repository you want to allow  CodeBuild
                   to  have access to, and then choose Authorize application .
                   (After you have connected to your GitHub  account,  you  do
                   not  need  to  finish  creating  the build project. You can
                   leave the CodeBuild console.) To instruct CodeBuild to  use
                   this  connection,  in  the  source object, set the auth ob-
                   ject's type value to OAUTH .

                 o For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS  clone
                   URL  to  the  repository  that  contains the source and the
                   buildspec file. You must connect your Amazon  Web  Services
                   account  to  your Bitbucket account. Use the CodeBuild con-
                   sole to start creating a build project. When  you  use  the
                   console  to  connect  (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the
                   Bitbucket Confirm access to your account page, choose Grant
                   access  .  (After  you have connected to your Bitbucket ac-
                   count, you  do  not  need  to  finish  creating  the  build
                   project.  You can leave the CodeBuild console.) To instruct
                   CodeBuild to use this connection, in the source object, set
                   the auth object's type value to OAUTH .

                 If  you  specify  CODEPIPELINE  for  the Type property, don't
                 specify this property. For all of the other types,  you  must
                 specify Location .

              gitCloneDepth -> (integer)
                 Information about the Git clone depth for the build project.

              gitSubmodulesConfig -> (structure)
                 Information  about  the  Git submodules configuration for the
                 build project.

                 fetchSubmodules -> (boolean)
                     Set to true to fetch Git submodules  for  your  CodeBuild
                     build project.

              buildspec -> (string)
                 The  buildspec file declaration to use for the builds in this
                 build project.

                 If this value is set, it can be either  an  inline  buildspec
                 definition,  the path to an alternate buildspec file relative
                 to the value of the  built-in  CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR  environment
                 variable,  or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in
                 the same Amazon Web Services Region  as  the  build  project.
                 Specify  the  buildspec  file  using  its  ARN  (for example,
                 arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml  ).  If  this
                 value  is  not  provided  or  is  set to an empty string, the
                 source code must contain a buildspec file in its root  direc-
                 tory. For more information, see Buildspec File Name and Stor-
                 age Location .

              auth -> (structure)
                 Information about the authorization settings for CodeBuild to
                 access the source code to be built.

                 This  information  is  for  the CodeBuild console's use only.
                 Your code should not get or set this information directly.

                 type -> (string)

                     NOTE:
                        This data type is deprecated and is no longer accurate
                        or used.

                     The  authorization  type  to use. The only valid value is
                     OAUTH , which represents the OAuth authorization type.

                 resource -> (string)
                     The resource value that applies to the  specified  autho-
                     rization type.

              reportBuildStatus -> (boolean)
                 Set  to true to report the status of a build's start and fin-
                 ish to your source provider. This option is valid  only  when
                 your  source  provider  is GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bit-
                 bucket. If this  is  set  and  you  use  a  different  source
                 provider, an invalidInputException is thrown.

                 To be able to report the build status to the source provider,
                 the user associated with the source provider must have  write
                 access  to  the repo. If the user does not have write access,
                 the build status cannot be updated. For more information, see
                 Source provider access in the CodeBuild User Guide .

                 The  status  of  a build triggered by a webhook is always re-
                 ported to your source provider.

                 If your project's builds are triggered by a webhook, you must
                 push  a  new commit to the repo for a change to this property
                 to take effect.

              buildStatusConfig -> (structure)
                 Contains information that defines how the build  project  re-
                 ports the build status to the source provider. This option is
                 only used when the source provider is GITHUB ,  GITHUB_ENTER-
                 PRISE , or BITBUCKET .

                 context -> (string)
                     Specifies the context of the build status CodeBuild sends
                     to the source provider. The usage of this  parameter  de-
                     pends on the source provider.
                        Bitbucket

                     This parameter is used for the name parameter in the Bit-
                     bucket commit status. For more information, see build  in
                     the Bitbucket API documentation.
                        GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server

                     This  parameter  is used for the context parameter in the
                     GitHub commit status. For more information, see Create  a
                     commit status in the GitHub developer guide.

                 targetUrl -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  target  url of the build status CodeBuild
                     sends to the source provider. The usage of this parameter
                     depends on the source provider.
                        Bitbucket

                     This  parameter is used for the url parameter in the Bit-
                     bucket commit status. For more information, see build  in
                     the Bitbucket API documentation.
                        GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server

                     This  parameter  is  used for the target_url parameter in
                     the GitHub  commit  status.  For  more  information,  see
                     Create a commit status in the GitHub developer guide.

              insecureSsl -> (boolean)
                 Enable  this  flag to ignore SSL warnings while connecting to
                 the project source code.

              sourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 An identifier for this project  source.  The  identifier  can
                 only  contain  alphanumeric  characters  and underscores, and
                 must be less than 128 characters in length.

                 If specified, must be one of:

                 o For CodeCommit: the commit ID, branch, or Git tag to use.

                 o For GitHub: the commit ID, pull request ID, branch name, or
                   tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code
                   you want to build. If a pull request ID  is  specified,  it
                   must  use the format pr/pull-request-ID (for example, pr/25
                   ). If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD  commit
                   ID  is  used.  If  not specified, the default branch's HEAD

                   corresponds  to  the version of the source code you want to
                   build. If a branch name is  specified,  the  branch's  HEAD
                   commit  ID  is used. If not specified, the default branch's
                   HEAD commit ID is used.

                 o For Amazon S3: the version ID of the object that represents
                   the build input ZIP file to use.

              GitHub

          The commit ID, pull request ID, branch name, or tag name that corre-
          sponds  to  the  version  of the source code you want to build. If a
          pull request ID is specified, it must  use  the  format  pr/pull-re-
          quest-ID  (for  example  pr/25 ). If a branch name is specified, the
          branch's HEAD commit ID is  used.  If  not  specified,  the  default
          branch's HEAD commit ID is used.
              Bitbucket

          The commit ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the ver-
          sion of the source code you want to build. If a branch name is spec-
          ified,  the  branch's  HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the
          default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.
              Amazon S3

          The version ID of the object that represents  the  build  input  ZIP
          file to use.

          If  sourceVersion  is  specified  at  the  project  level, then this
          sourceVersion (at the build level) takes precedence.

          For more information, see Source Version Sample  with  CodeBuild  in
          the CodeBuild User Guide .

       --artifacts-override (structure)

              o If  type  is  set  to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores this
                value if specified. This is because CodePipeline  manages  its
                build output locations instead of CodeBuild.

              o If  type  is  set  to  NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored if
                specified, because no build output is produced.

              o If type is set to S3 , this is the name of the output bucket.

          path -> (string)
              Along with namespaceType and name , the pattern  that  CodeBuild
              uses to name and store the output artifact:

              o If  type  is  set  to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores this
                value if specified. This is because CodePipeline  manages  its
                build output names instead of CodeBuild.

              o If  type  is  set  to  NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored if
                specified, because no build output is produced.

              o If type is set to S3 , this is the path to  the  output  arti-
                fact. If path is not specified, path is not used.

              For  example,  if  path is set to MyArtifacts , namespaceType is
              set to NONE , and name is set to MyArtifact.zip , the output ar-
              tifact  is  stored  in  the output bucket at MyArtifacts/MyArti-
              fact.zip .

          namespaceType -> (string)
              Along with path and name , the pattern that  CodeBuild  uses  to
              determine the name and location to store the output artifact:

              o If  type  is  set  to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores this
                value if specified. This is because CodePipeline  manages  its
                build output names instead of CodeBuild.

              o If  type  is  set  to  NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored if
                specified, because no build output is produced.

              o If type is set to S3 , valid values include:

                o BUILD_ID : Include the build ID in the location of the build
                  output artifact.

                o NONE  :  Do not include the build ID. This is the default if
                  namespaceType is not specified.

              For example, if path is set to MyArtifacts  ,  namespaceType  is
              set to BUILD_ID , and name is set to MyArtifact.zip , the output
              artifact is stored in MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip .

          name -> (string)
              Along with path and namespaceType , the pattern  that  CodeBuild

                specified, because no build output is produced.

              o If type is set to S3 , this is the name of the output artifact
                object.  If  you set the name to be a forward slash ("/"), the
                artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket.

              For example:

              o If path is set  to  MyArtifacts  ,  namespaceType  is  set  to
                BUILD_ID , and name is set to MyArtifact.zip , then the output
                artifact is stored in MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip .

              o If path is empty, namespaceType is set to NONE , and  name  is
                set  to "/ ", the output artifact is stored in the root of the
                output bucket.

              o If path is set  to  MyArtifacts  ,  namespaceType  is  set  to
                BUILD_ID  ,  and  name  is set to "/ ", the output artifact is
                stored in MyArtifacts/<build-ID> .

          packaging -> (string)
              The type of build output artifact to create:

              o If type is set to CODEPIPELINE  ,  CodePipeline  ignores  this
                value  if  specified. This is because CodePipeline manages its
                build output artifacts instead of CodeBuild.

              o If type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS ,  this  value  is  ignored  if
                specified, because no build output is produced.

              o If type is set to S3 , valid values include:

                o NONE  : CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a folder that
                  contains the build output. This is the default if  packaging
                  is not specified.

                o ZIP : CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a ZIP file that
                  contains the build output.

          overrideArtifactName -> (boolean)
              If this flag is set, a name  specified  in  the  buildspec  file
              overrides  the  artifact name. The name specified in a buildspec
              file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Command Lan-
              guage. For example, you can append a date and time to your arti-
              fact name so that it is always unique.

          encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
              Set to true if you do not want your output artifacts  encrypted.
              This  option  is valid only if your artifacts type is Amazon S3.
              If this is set with another artifacts type,  an  invalidInputEx-
              ception is thrown.

          artifactIdentifier -> (string)
              An identifier for this artifact definition.

          bucketOwnerAccess -> (string)
              Specifies the bucket owner's access for objects that another ac-
              count uploads to their Amazon S3 bucket. By  default,  only  the
              account  that  uploads  the  objects to the bucket has access to
              these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket owner
              access to these objects.

              NOTE:
                 To  use  this property, your CodeBuild service role must have
                 the s3:PutBucketAcl permission. This permission allows  Code-
                 Build to modify the access control list for the bucket.

              This property can be one of the following values:
                 NONE

              The  bucket  owner  does not have access to the objects. This is
              the default.
                 READ_ONLY

              The bucket owner has read-only access to the  objects.  The  up-
              loading account retains ownership of the objects.
                 FULL

              The  bucket  owner has full access to the objects. Object owner-
              ship is determined by the following criteria:

              o If the bucket is configured with the  Bucket  owner  preferred
                setting,  the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading ac-
                count will have object access as  specified  by  the  bucket's
                policy.

              o Otherwise,  the uploading account retains ownership of the ob-
                jects.

       --secondary-artifacts-override (list)
          An array of ProjectArtifacts objects that override the secondary ar-
          tifacts defined in the batch build project.

          (structure)
              Information  about  the  build  output  artifacts  for the build
              project.

              type -> (string)
                 The type of build output artifact. Valid values include:

                 o CODEPIPELINE : The build project has build output generated
                   through CodePipeline.

                 NOTE:
                     The CODEPIPELINE type is not supported for secondaryArti-
                     facts .

                 o NO_ARTIFACTS : The build project does not produce any build
                   output.

                 o S3 : The build project stores build output in Amazon S3.

              location -> (string)

                     Web  Services  secret  key  IDs  and  secret access keys.
                     PLAINTEXT environment variables can be displayed in plain
                     text  using the CodeBuild console and the CLI. For sensi-
                     tive values, we recommend you use an environment variable
                     of type PARAMETER_STORE or SECRETS_MANAGER .

              type -> (string)
                 The type of environment variable. Valid values include:

                 o PARAMETER_STORE : An environment variable stored in Systems
                   Manager Parameter Store. To learn how to specify a  parame-
                   ter  store environment variable, see env/parameter-store in
                   the CodeBuild User Guide .

                 o PLAINTEXT : An environment variable in plain  text  format.
                   This is the default value.

                 o SECRETS_MANAGER : An environment variable stored in Secrets
                   Manager. To learn how to specify a secrets manager environ-
                   ment  variable,  see  env/secrets-manager  in the CodeBuild
                   User Guide .

          defined in the batch build project.

       --source-auth-override (structure)
          A SourceAuth object that overrides the  one  defined  in  the  batch
          build  project.  This  override  applies only if the build project's
          source is BitBucket or GitHub.

          type -> (string)

              NOTE:
                 This data type is deprecated and is  no  longer  accurate  or
                 used.

              The  authorization  type to use. The only valid value is OAUTH ,
              which represents the OAuth authorization type.

          resource -> (string)
              The resource value that applies to the  specified  authorization
              type.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          type=string,resource=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "type": "OAUTH",
            "resource": "string"
          }

       --git-clone-depth-override (integer)
          The  user-defined  depth of history, with a minimum value of 0, that
          overrides, for this batch build only, any previous depth of  history
          defined in the batch build project.

       --git-submodules-config-override (structure)
          A  GitSubmodulesConfig object that overrides the Git submodules con-
          figuration for this batch build.

          fetchSubmodules -> (boolean)
              Set to true to fetch Git submodules  for  your  CodeBuild  build
              project.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          fetchSubmodules=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "fetchSubmodules": true|false
          }

       --buildspec-override (string)
          A  buildspec  file  declaration that overrides, for this build only,
          the latest one already defined in the build project.

          If this value is set, it can be either an inline  buildspec  defini-
          tion,  the path to an alternate buildspec file relative to the value
          of the built-in CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR environment variable, or the  path
          to  an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in the same Amazon Web Services
          Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec  file  using  its
          ARN (for example, arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml ).
          If this value is not provided or is set  to  an  empty  string,  the
          source code must contain a buildspec file in its root directory. For
          more information, see Buildspec File Name and Storage Location .

       --insecure-ssl-override | --no-insecure-ssl-override (boolean)
          Enable this flag to override the insecure SSL setting that is speci-
          fied in the batch build project. The insecure SSL setting determines
          whether to ignore SSL  warnings  while  connecting  to  the  project
          source  code.  This  override  applies only if the build's source is
          GitHub Enterprise.

       --report-build-batch-status-override   |   --no-report-build-batch-sta-
       tus-override (boolean)
          Set  to true to report to your source provider the status of a batch
          build's start and completion. If you use this option with  a  source
          provider  other than GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket, an in-
          validInputException is thrown.

          NOTE:
              The status of a build triggered by a webhook is always  reported
              to your source provider.

       --environment-type-override (string)
          A  container type for this batch build that overrides the one speci-
          fied in the batch build project.

          Possible values:

          o WINDOWS_CONTAINER

          o LINUX_CONTAINER

          o LINUX_GPU_CONTAINER

          o ARM_CONTAINER

          o WINDOWS_SERVER_2019_CONTAINER

       --image-override (string)
          The name of an image for this batch build  that  overrides  the  one
          specified in the batch build project.

       --compute-type-override (string)
          The  name  of a compute type for this batch build that overrides the
          one specified in the batch build project.

          Possible values:

          o BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL

          o BUILD_GENERAL1_MEDIUM

          o BUILD_GENERAL1_LARGE

          o BUILD_GENERAL1_2XLARGE

       --certificate-override (string)
          The name of a certificate for this batch build  that  overrides  the
          one specified in the batch build project.

       --cache-override (structure)
          A ProjectCache object that specifies cache overrides.

          type -> (string)
              The  type  of  cache used by the build project. Valid values in-
              clude:

              o NO_CACHE : The build project does not use any cache.

              o S3 : The build project reads and writes from and to S3.

              o LOCAL : The build project stores a cache locally  on  a  build
                host that is only available to that build host.

          location -> (string)
              Information about the cache location:

              o NO_CACHE or LOCAL : This value is ignored.

              o S3 : This is the S3 bucket name/prefix.

          modes -> (list)
              An  array of strings that specify the local cache modes. You can
              use one or more local cache modes at the same time. This is only
              used for LOCAL cache types.

              Possible values are:
                 LOCAL_SOURCE_CACHE

              Caches Git metadata for primary and secondary sources. After the
              cache is created, subsequent builds pull only the change between
              commits.  This  mode  is a good choice for projects with a clean
              working directory and a source that is a large  Git  repository.
              If  you  choose  this option and your project does not use a Git
              repository (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket), the option
              is ignored.
                 LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE

              Caches  existing  Docker  layers. This mode is a good choice for
              projects that build or pull large Docker images. It can  prevent
              the  performance  issues  caused  by pulling large Docker images
              down from the network.

              NOTE:

                 o You can use a Docker layer cache in the  Linux  environment
                   only.

                 o The  privileged  flag  must be set so that your project has
                   the required Docker permissions.

                 o You should consider the security  implications  before  you
                   use a Docker layer cache.

                 LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE

              Caches  directories you specify in the buildspec file. This mode
              is a good choice if your build scenario is not suited to one  of
              the other three local cache modes. If you use a custom cache:

              o Only  directories  can  be  specified  for caching. You cannot
                specify individual files.

              o Symlinks are used to reference cached directories.

              o Cached directories are linked to your build  before  it  down-
                loads  its  project  sources. Cached items are overridden if a
                source item has the same name. Directories are specified using
                cache paths in the buildspec file.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          type=string,location=string,modes=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "type": "NO_CACHE"|"S3"|"LOCAL",
            "location": "string",
            "modes": ["LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE"|"LOCAL_SOURCE_CACHE"|"LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE", ...]
          }

       --service-role-override (string)
          The  name  of a service role for this batch build that overrides the
          one specified in the batch build project.

       --privileged-mode-override | --no-privileged-mode-override (boolean)
          Enable this flag to override privileged  mode  in  the  batch  build
          project.

       --build-timeout-in-minutes-override (integer)
          Overrides the build timeout specified in the batch build project.

       --queued-timeout-in-minutes-override (integer)
          The  number  of minutes a batch build is allowed to be queued before
          it times out.

       --encryption-key-override (string)
          The Key Management Service customer master key (CMK) that  overrides
          the  one  specified in the batch build project. The CMK key encrypts
          the build output artifacts.

          NOTE:
              You can use a cross-account KMS key to encrypt the build  output
              artifacts if your service role has permission to that key.

          You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK or,
          if available, the CMK's alias (using the  format  alias/<alias-name>
          ).

       --idempotency-token (string)
          A  unique, case sensitive identifier you provide to ensure the idem-
          potency of the StartBuildBatch request. The token is included in the
          StartBuildBatch request and is valid for five minutes. If you repeat
          the StartBuildBatch request with the same token, but change a param-
          eter, CodeBuild returns a parameter mismatch error.

       --logs-config-override (structure)
          A  LogsConfig  object  that override the log settings defined in the
          batch build project.

          cloudWatchLogs -> (structure)
              Information about CloudWatch Logs for a  build  project.  Cloud-
              Watch Logs are enabled by default.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status of the logs in CloudWatch Logs for a build
                 project. Valid values are:

                 o ENABLED :  CloudWatch  Logs  are  enabled  for  this  build
                   project.

                 o DISABLED  :  CloudWatch Logs are not enabled for this build
                   project.

              groupName -> (string)
                 The group name of the logs in CloudWatch Logs. For  more  in-
                 formation, see Working with Log Groups and Log Streams .

              streamName -> (string)
                 The  prefix  of  the  stream name of the CloudWatch Logs. For
                 more information, see Working with Log Groups and Log Streams
                 .

          s3Logs -> (structure)
              Information  about  logs  built  to  an  S3  bucket  for a build
              project. S3 logs are not enabled by default.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status of the S3 build logs. Valid values are:

                 o ENABLED : S3 build logs are enabled for this build project.

                 o DISABLED : S3 build logs are not  enabled  for  this  build
                   project.

              location -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of an S3 bucket and the path prefix for S3 logs. If
                 your Amazon S3 bucket name is my-bucket , and your path  pre-
                 fix    is   build-log   ,   then   acceptable   formats   are
                 my-bucket/build-log or arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/build-log .

              encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                 Set to true if you do not want your S3 build log  output  en-
                 crypted. By default S3 build logs are encrypted.

              bucketOwnerAccess -> (string)
                 Specifies  the bucket owner's access for objects that another
                 account uploads to their Amazon S3 bucket. By  default,  only
                 the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access
                 to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket
                 owner access to these objects.

                 NOTE:
                     To  use  this  property, your CodeBuild service role must
                     have the s3:PutBucketAcl permission. This permission  al-
                     lows  CodeBuild to modify the access control list for the
                     bucket.

                 This property can be one of the following values:
                     NONE

                 The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is
                 the default.
                     READ_ONLY

                 The bucket owner has read-only access to the objects. The up-
                 loading account retains ownership of the objects.
                     FULL

                 The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object  own-
                 ership is determined by the following criteria:

                 o If the bucket is configured with the Bucket owner preferred
                   setting, the bucket owner owns the objects.  The  uploading
                   account  will  have  object  access  as  specified  by  the
                   bucket's policy.

                 o Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership  of  the
                   objects.

                 For  more  information  about Amazon S3 object ownership, see
                 Controlling ownership of uploaded  objects  using  S3  Object
                 Ownership in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide .

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or name  of  credentials  created
              using Secrets Manager.

              NOTE:
                 The  credential  can  use the name of the credentials only if
                 they exist in your current Amazon Web Services Region.

          credentialProvider -> (string)
              The service that created the credentials  to  access  a  private
              Docker  registry.  The  valid value, SECRETS_MANAGER, is for Se-
              crets Manager.

       --image-pull-credentials-type-override (string)
          The type of credentials CodeBuild uses to pull images in your  batch
          build. There are two valid values:
              CODEBUILD

          Specifies  that  CodeBuild  uses  its own credentials. This requires
          that you modify your ECR repository policy to trust CodeBuild's ser-
          vice principal.
              SERVICE_ROLE

          Specifies that CodeBuild uses your build project's service role.

          When  using  a cross-account or private registry image, you must use
          SERVICE_ROLE credentials. When using an CodeBuild curated image, you
          must use CODEBUILD credentials.

          Possible values:

          o CODEBUILD

          o SERVICE_ROLE

       --build-batch-config-override (structure)
          A BuildBatchConfigOverride object that contains batch build configu-
          ration overrides.

          serviceRole -> (string)
              Specifies the service role ARN for the batch build project.

          combineArtifacts -> (boolean)
              Specifies if the build artifacts for the batch build  should  be
              combined into a single artifact location.

          restrictions -> (structure)
              A  BatchRestrictions  object that specifies the restrictions for
              the batch build.

              maximumBuildsAllowed -> (integer)
                 Specifies the maximum number of builds allowed.

              computeTypesAllowed -> (list)
                 An array of strings that specify the compute types  that  are
                 allowed  for  the  batch build. See Build environment compute
                 types in the CodeBuild User Guide for these values.

                 (string)

          timeoutInMins -> (integer)
              Specifies the maximum amount of time, in minutes, that the batch
              build must be completed in.

          batchReportMode -> (string)
              Specifies  how  build  status  reports  are  sent  to the source
              provider for the batch build. This property is  only  used  when
              the  source  provider  for your project is Bitbucket, GitHub, or
              GitHub Enterprise, and your  project  is  configured  to  report
              build statuses to the source provider.
                 REPORT_AGGREGATED_BATCH

              (Default) Aggregate all of the build statuses into a single sta-
              tus report.
                 REPORT_INDIVIDUAL_BUILDS

              Send a separate status report for each individual build.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          serviceRole=string,combineArtifacts=boolean,restrictions={maximumBuildsAllowed=integer,computeTypesAllowed=[string,string]},timeoutInMins=integer,batchReportMode=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "serviceRole": "string",
            "combineArtifacts": true|false,
            "restrictions": {
              "maximumBuildsAllowed": integer,
              "computeTypesAllowed": ["string", ...]
            },
            "timeoutInMins": integer,
            "batchReportMode": "REPORT_INDIVIDUAL_BUILDS"|"REPORT_AGGREGATED_BATCH"
          }

       --debug-session-enabled | --no-debug-session-enabled (boolean)
          Specifies if session debugging is enabled for this batch build.  For
          more  information,  see Viewing a running build in Session Manager .
          Batch session debugging is not supported for matrix batch builds.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                 o CODECOMMIT : The source code is in  an  CodeCommit  reposi-
                   tory.

                 o CODEPIPELINE  :  The  source code settings are specified in
                   the source action of a pipeline in CodePipeline.

                 o GITHUB : The source code is in a GitHub  or  GitHub  Enter-
                   prise Cloud repository.

                 o For  source  code settings that are specified in the source
                   action of a pipeline in CodePipeline, location  should  not
                   be  specified. If it is specified, CodePipeline ignores it.
                   This is because CodePipeline uses the settings in  a  pipe-
                   line's source action instead of this value.

                 o For  source  code  in  an  CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS
                   clone URL to the repository that contains the  source  code
                   and  the  buildspec file (for example, https://git-codecom-
                   mit.<region-ID>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/<repo-name> ).

                 o For source code in an Amazon S3 input bucket,  one  of  the
                   following.

                   o The  path  to  the ZIP file that contains the source code
                     (for example, <bucket-name>/<path>/<object-name>.zip ).

                   o The path to the folder that contains the source code (for
                     example, <bucket-name>/<path-to-source-code>/<folder>/ ).

                 o For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL
                   to the repository that contains the source and  the  build-
                   spec  file.  You  must connect your Amazon Web Services ac-
                   count to your GitHub account. Use the CodeBuild console  to
                   start creating a build project. When you use the console to
                   connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub Authorize
                   application  page, for Organization access , choose Request
                   access next to each repository you want to allow  CodeBuild
                   to  have access to, and then choose Authorize application .
                   (After you have connected to your GitHub  account,  you  do
                   not  need  to  finish  creating  the build project. You can
                   leave the CodeBuild console.) To instruct CodeBuild to  use
                   this  connection,  in  the  source object, set the auth ob-
                   ject's type value to OAUTH .

                 o For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS  clone
                   URL  to  the  repository  that  contains the source and the
                   buildspec file. You must connect your Amazon  Web  Services
                   account  to  your Bitbucket account. Use the CodeBuild con-
                   sole to start creating a build project. When  you  use  the
                   console  to  connect  (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the
                   Bitbucket Confirm access to your account page, choose Grant
                   access  .  (After  you have connected to your Bitbucket ac-
                   count, you  do  not  need  to  finish  creating  the  build
                   project.  You can leave the CodeBuild console.) To instruct
                   CodeBuild to use this connection, in the source object, set
                   the auth object's type value to OAUTH .

                 If  you  specify  CODEPIPELINE  for  the Type property, don't
                 specify this property. For all of the other types,  you  must
                 specify Location .

              gitCloneDepth -> (integer)
                 Information about the Git clone depth for the build project.

              gitSubmodulesConfig -> (structure)
                 Information  about  the  Git submodules configuration for the
                 build project.

                 fetchSubmodules -> (boolean)
                     Set to true to fetch Git submodules  for  your  CodeBuild
                     build project.

              buildspec -> (string)
                 The  buildspec file declaration to use for the builds in this
                 build project.

                 If this value is set, it can be either  an  inline  buildspec
                 definition,  the path to an alternate buildspec file relative
                 to the value of the  built-in  CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR  environment
                 variable,  or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in
                 the same Amazon Web Services Region  as  the  build  project.
                 Specify  the  buildspec  file  using  its  ARN  (for example,
                 arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml  ).  If  this
                 value  is  not  provided  or  is  set to an empty string, the
                 source code must contain a buildspec file in its root  direc-
                 tory. For more information, see Buildspec File Name and Stor-
                 age Location .

              auth -> (structure)
                 Information about the authorization settings for CodeBuild to
                 access the source code to be built.

                 This  information  is  for  the CodeBuild console's use only.
                 Your code should not get or set this information directly.

                 type -> (string)

                     NOTE:

                        or used.

                     The  authorization  type  to use. The only valid value is
                     OAUTH , which represents the OAuth authorization type.

                 resource -> (string)
                     The resource value that applies to the  specified  autho-
                     rization type.

              reportBuildStatus -> (boolean)
                 Set  to true to report the status of a build's start and fin-
                 ish to your source provider. This option is valid  only  when
                 your  source  provider  is GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bit-
                 bucket. If this  is  set  and  you  use  a  different  source
                 provider, an invalidInputException is thrown.

                 To be able to report the build status to the source provider,
                 the user associated with the source provider must have  write
                 access  to  the repo. If the user does not have write access,
                 the build status cannot be updated. For more information, see
                 Source provider access in the CodeBuild User Guide .

                 The  status  of  a build triggered by a webhook is always re-
                 ported to your source provider.

                 If your project's builds are triggered by a webhook, you must
                 push  a  new commit to the repo for a change to this property
                 to take effect.

              buildStatusConfig -> (structure)
                 Contains information that defines how the build  project  re-
                 ports the build status to the source provider. This option is
                 only used when the source provider is GITHUB ,  GITHUB_ENTER-
                 PRISE , or BITBUCKET .

                 context -> (string)
                     Specifies the context of the build status CodeBuild sends
                     to the source provider. The usage of this  parameter  de-
                     pends on the source provider.
                        Bitbucket

                     This parameter is used for the name parameter in the Bit-

                        GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server

                     This  parameter  is used for the context parameter in the
                     GitHub commit status. For more information, see Create  a
                     commit status in the GitHub developer guide.

                 targetUrl -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  target  url of the build status CodeBuild
                     sends to the source provider. The usage of this parameter
                     depends on the source provider.
                        Bitbucket

                     This  parameter is used for the url parameter in the Bit-
                     bucket commit status. For more information, see build  in
                     the Bitbucket API documentation.
                        GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server

              sourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 An identifier for this project  source.  The  identifier  can
                 only  contain  alphanumeric  characters  and underscores, and
                 must be less than 128 characters in length.

          secondarySources -> (list)
              An array of ProjectSource objects that define  the  sources  for
              the batch build.

              (structure)
                 Information  about  the build input source code for the build
                 project.

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of repository that contains the source  code  to
                     be built. Valid values include:

                     o BITBUCKET  :  The source code is in a Bitbucket reposi-
                       tory.

                     o CODECOMMIT : The source code is in an CodeCommit repos-
                       itory.

                     o CODEPIPELINE  :  The source code settings are specified
                       in the source action of a pipeline in CodePipeline.

                     o GITHUB : The source code is in a GitHub or  GitHub  En-
                       terprise Cloud repository.

                     o GITHUB_ENTERPRISE  : The source code is in a GitHub En-
                       terprise Server repository.

                     o NO_SOURCE : The project  does  not  have  input  source
                       code.

                     o S3 : The source code is in an Amazon S3 bucket.

                 location -> (string)
                     Information  about  the location of the source code to be
                     built. Valid values include:

                     o For source code settings  that  are  specified  in  the
                       source  action  of a pipeline in CodePipeline, location
                       should not be specified.  If  it  is  specified,  Code-
                       Pipeline  ignores it. This is because CodePipeline uses
                       the settings in a pipeline's source action  instead  of
                       this value.

                     o For  source code in an CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS
                       clone URL to the repository that  contains  the  source
                       code    and    the   buildspec   file   (for   example,
                       https://git-codecommit.<region-ID>.amazonaws.com/v1/re-
                       pos/<repo-name> ).

                     o For  source  code  in an Amazon S3 input bucket, one of
                       the following.

                       o The path to the ZIP file  that  contains  the  source
                         code    (for    example,    <bucket-name>/<path>/<ob-
                         ject-name>.zip ).

                       o The path to the folder that contains the source  code
                         (for                                         example,
                         <bucket-name>/<path-to-source-code>/<folder>/ ).

                     o For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone
                       URL  to the repository that contains the source and the
                       buildspec file. You must connect your Amazon  Web  Ser-
                       vices account to your GitHub account. Use the CodeBuild
                       console to start creating a build project. When you use
                       the  console  to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on
                       the GitHub Authorize application page, for Organization
                       access  , choose Request access next to each repository
                       you want to allow CodeBuild to have access to, and then
                       choose  Authorize  application  .  (After you have con-
                       nected to your GitHub account, you do not need to  fin-
                       ish creating the build project. You can leave the Code-
                       Build console.) To instruct CodeBuild to use this  con-
                       nection,  in  the  source object, set the auth object's
                       type value to OAUTH .

                     o For source code in a Bitbucket  repository,  the  HTTPS
                       clone  URL  to  the repository that contains the source
                       and the buildspec file. You must  connect  your  Amazon
                       Web Services account to your Bitbucket account. Use the
                       CodeBuild console to start creating  a  build  project.
                       When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with
                       Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket Confirm access to your  ac-
                       count  page, choose Grant access . (After you have con-
                       nected to your Bitbucket account, you do  not  need  to
                       finish  creating  the  build project. You can leave the
                       CodeBuild console.) To instruct CodeBuild to  use  this
                       connection, in the source object, set the auth object's
                       type value to OAUTH .

                     If you specify CODEPIPELINE for the Type property,  don't
                     specify  this  property.  For all of the other types, you
                     must specify Location .

                 gitCloneDepth -> (integer)
                     Information about the  Git  clone  depth  for  the  build
                     project.

                 gitSubmodulesConfig -> (structure)
                     Information  about  the  Git submodules configuration for
                     the build project.

                     fetchSubmodules -> (boolean)
                        Set to true to fetch Git submodules for your CodeBuild
                        build project.

                 buildspec -> (string)
                     The  buildspec  file declaration to use for the builds in
                     this build project.

                     If this value is set, it can be either an  inline  build-
                     spec  definition, the path to an alternate buildspec file
                     relative to the value of the  built-in  CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR
                     environment  variable,  or  the path to an S3 bucket. The
                     bucket must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region  as
                     the  build  project. Specify the buildspec file using its
                     ARN    (for    example,    arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sam-
                     ple2/buildspec.yml ). If this value is not provided or is
                     set to an empty string, the source code  must  contain  a
                     buildspec  file  in its root directory. For more informa-
                     tion, see Buildspec File Name and Storage Location .

                     Information about the authorization  settings  for  Code-
                     Build to access the source code to be built.

                     This information is for the CodeBuild console's use only.
                     Your code should not get  or  set  this  information  di-
                     rectly.

                     type -> (string)

                        NOTE:
                            This  data type is deprecated and is no longer ac-
                            curate or used.

                        The authorization type to use. The only valid value is
                        OAUTH , which represents the OAuth authorization type.

                     resource -> (string)
                        The  resource  value that applies to the specified au-
                        thorization type.

                 reportBuildStatus -> (boolean)
                     Set to true to report the status of a build's  start  and
                     finish to your source provider. This option is valid only
                     when your source provider is GitHub,  GitHub  Enterprise,
                     or  Bitbucket.  If  this  is  set and you use a different
                     source provider, an invalidInputException is thrown.

                     To be able to report  the  build  status  to  the  source
                     provider,  the  user  associated with the source provider
                     must have write access to the repo. If the user does  not
                     have  write  access,  the build status cannot be updated.
                     For more information, see Source provider access  in  the
                     CodeBuild User Guide .

                     The  status  of  a build triggered by a webhook is always
                     reported to your source provider.

                     fier. If specified, must be one of:

                     o For  CodeCommit:  the  commit ID, branch, or Git tag to
                       use.

                     o For GitHub: the commit  ID,  pull  request  ID,  branch
                       name,  or  tag  name that corresponds to the version of
                       the source code you want to build. If a pull request ID
                       is specified, it must use the format pr/pull-request-ID
                       (for example, pr/25 ). If a branch name  is  specified,
                       the  branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified,
                       the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

                     o For Bitbucket: the commit ID, branch name, or tag  name
                       that  corresponds to the version of the source code you
                       want to build. If  a  branch  name  is  specified,  the
                       branch's  HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the
                       default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

                     o For Amazon S3: the version ID of the object that repre-
                       sents the build input ZIP file to use.

                     For  more  information,  see  Source  Version Sample with
                     CodeBuild in the CodeBuild User Guide .

          artifacts -> (structure)
              A BuildArtifacts object the defines the build artifacts for this
              batch build.

              location -> (string)
                 Information about the location of the build artifacts.

              sha256sum -> (string)
                 The SHA-256 hash of the build artifact.

                 You  can  use this hash along with a checksum tool to confirm
                 file integrity and authenticity.

                 NOTE:
                     This value is available only if the build project's pack-
                     aging value is set to ZIP .

              md5sum -> (string)
                 The MD5 hash of the build artifact.

                 You  can  use this hash along with a checksum tool to confirm
                 file integrity and authenticity.

                 NOTE:
                     This value is available only if the build project's pack-
                     aging value is set to ZIP .

              overrideArtifactName -> (boolean)
                 If  this  flag is set, a name specified in the buildspec file
                 overrides the artifact name. The name specified in  a  build-
                 spec file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Com-
                 mand Language. For example, you can append a date and time to
                 your artifact name so that it is always unique.

              encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                 Information  that tells you if encryption for build artifacts
                 is disabled.

              artifactIdentifier -> (string)
                 An identifier for this artifact definition.

              bucketOwnerAccess -> (string)
                 Specifies the bucket owner's access for objects that  another
                 account  uploads  to their Amazon S3 bucket. By default, only
                 the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access
                 to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket
                 owner access to these objects.

                 NOTE:
                     To use this property, your CodeBuild  service  role  must
                     have  the s3:PutBucketAcl permission. This permission al-
                     lows CodeBuild to modify the access control list for  the
                     bucket.

                 This property can be one of the following values:
                     NONE

                 The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is
                 the default.
                     READ_ONLY

                 The bucket owner has read-only access to the objects. The up-
                 loading account retains ownership of the objects.
                     FULL

                 The  bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object own-
                 ership is determined by the following criteria:

                 o If the bucket is configured with the Bucket owner preferred
                   setting,  the  bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading
                   account  will  have  object  access  as  specified  by  the
                   bucket's policy.

                 o Otherwise,  the  uploading account retains ownership of the
                   objects.

                 For more information about Amazon S3  object  ownership,  see
                 Controlling  ownership  of  uploaded  objects using S3 Object
                 Ownership in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide .

          secondaryArtifacts -> (list)
              An array of BuildArtifacts objects the define  the  build  arti-
              facts for this batch build.

              (structure)
                 Information about build output artifacts.

                 location -> (string)
                     Information about the location of the build artifacts.

                 sha256sum -> (string)
                     The SHA-256 hash of the build artifact.

                     You  can use this hash along with a checksum tool to con-
                     firm file integrity and authenticity.

                     NOTE:
                        This value is available only if  the  build  project's
                        packaging value is set to ZIP .

                 md5sum -> (string)
                     The MD5 hash of the build artifact.

                     You  can use this hash along with a checksum tool to con-
                     firm file integrity and authenticity.

                     NOTE:
                        This value is available only if  the  build  project's
                        packaging value is set to ZIP .

                 overrideArtifactName -> (boolean)
                     If  this  flag  is set, a name specified in the buildspec
                     file overrides the artifact name. The name specified in a
                     buildspec  file  is calculated at build time and uses the
                     Shell Command Language. For example,  you  can  append  a
                     date  and time to your artifact name so that it is always
                     unique.

                 encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                     Information that tells you if encryption for build  arti-
                     facts is disabled.

                 artifactIdentifier -> (string)
                     An identifier for this artifact definition.

                 bucketOwnerAccess -> (string)
                     Specifies  the bucket owner's access for objects that an-
                     other account uploads to their Amazon S3 bucket.  By  de-
                     fault,  only  the account that uploads the objects to the
                     bucket has access to these objects. This property  allows
                     you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

                     NOTE:
                        To use this property, your CodeBuild service role must
                        have the s3:PutBucketAcl permission.  This  permission
                        allows CodeBuild to modify the access control list for
                        the bucket.

                     This property can be one of the following values:
                        NONE

                     The bucket owner does not have  access  to  the  objects.
                     This is the default.
                        READ_ONLY

                     The bucket owner has read-only access to the objects. The
                     uploading account retains ownership of the objects.
                        FULL

                     The bucket owner has full access to the  objects.  Object
                     ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                     o If  the bucket is configured with the Bucket owner pre-
                       ferred setting, the bucket owner owns the objects.  The
                       uploading  account will have object access as specified
                       by the bucket's policy.

                     o Otherwise, the uploading account retains  ownership  of
                       the objects.

                     User Guide .

          cache -> (structure)
              Information about the cache for the build project.

              type -> (string)
                 The type of cache used by the build project. Valid values in-
                 clude:

                 o NO_CACHE : The build project does not use any cache.

                 o S3 : The build project reads and writes from and to S3.

                 o LOCAL : The build project stores a cache locally on a build
                   host that is only available to that build host.

              location -> (string)
                 Information about the cache location:

                 o NO_CACHE or LOCAL : This value is ignored.

                 o S3 : This is the S3 bucket name/prefix.

              modes -> (list)
                 An array of strings that specify the local cache  modes.  You
                 can  use one or more local cache modes at the same time. This
                 is only used for LOCAL cache types.

                 Possible values are:
                     LOCAL_SOURCE_CACHE

                 Caches Git metadata for primary and secondary sources.  After
                 the  cache is created, subsequent builds pull only the change
                 between commits. This mode is a good choice for projects with
                 a  clean  working  directory and a source that is a large Git
                 repository. If you choose this option and your  project  does
                 not  use a Git repository (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bit-
                 bucket), the option is ignored.
                     LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE

                 Caches existing Docker layers. This mode is a good choice for
                 projects  that build or pull large Docker images. It can pre-
                 vent the performance issues caused by  pulling  large  Docker
                 images down from the network.

                 NOTE:

                     o You  can use a Docker layer cache in the Linux environ-
                       ment only.

                     o The privileged flag must be set so  that  your  project
                       has the required Docker permissions.

                     o You  should  consider  the security implications before
                       you use a Docker layer cache.

                     LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE

                 Caches directories you specify in the  buildspec  file.  This
                 mode is a good choice if your build scenario is not suited to
                 one of the other three local cache modes. If you use a custom
                 cache:

                 o Only  directories  can be specified for caching. You cannot
                   specify individual files.

                 o Symlinks are used to reference cached directories.

                 o Cached directories are linked to your build before it down-
                   loads its project sources. Cached items are overridden if a
                   source item has the same name.  Directories  are  specified
                   using cache paths in the buildspec file.

                 (string)

          environment -> (structure)

                          specify a parameter store environment variable,  see
                          env/parameter-store in the CodeBuild User Guide .

                        o PLAINTEXT  :  An  environment variable in plain text
                          format. This is the default value.

                        o SECRETS_MANAGER : An environment variable stored  in
                          Secrets  Manager.  To learn how to specify a secrets
                          manager       environment       variable,        see
                          env/secrets-manager in the CodeBuild User Guide .

              privilegedMode -> (boolean)
                 Enables  running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container.
                 Set to true only if the build project is used to build Docker
                 images. Otherwise, a build that attempts to interact with the
                 Docker daemon fails. The default setting is false .

                 You can initialize the Docker daemon during the install phase
                 of your build by adding one of the following sets of commands
                 to the install phase of your buildspec file:

                 If the operating system's base image is Ubuntu Linux:
                     -              nohup               /usr/local/bin/dockerd
                     --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock
                     --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&

                     - timeout 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo  .;  sleep
                     1; done"

                 If  the operating system's base image is Alpine Linux and the
                 previous command does not work, add the -t argument to  time-
                 out :
                     -               nohup              /usr/local/bin/dockerd
                     --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock
                     --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&

                     -  timeout  -t  15  sh  -c "until docker info; do echo .;
                     sleep 1; done"

              certificate -> (string)
                 The ARN of the Amazon S3 bucket, path prefix, and object  key
                 that  contains  the  PEM-encoded  certificate  for  the build
                 project. For more information, see certificate in  the  Code-
                 Build User Guide .

              registryCredential -> (structure)
                 The credentials for access to a private registry.

                 credential -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) or name of credentials
                     created using Secrets Manager.

                     NOTE:
                        The credential can use the  name  of  the  credentials
                        only if they exist in your current Amazon Web Services
                        Region.

                 credentialProvider -> (string)
                     The service that created the credentials to access a pri-
                     vate  Docker  registry. The valid value, SECRETS_MANAGER,
                     is for Secrets Manager.

              imagePullCredentialsType -> (string)
                 The type of credentials CodeBuild uses to pull images in your
                 build. There are two valid values:

                 o CODEBUILD  specifies  that  CodeBuild  uses its own creden-
                   tials. This requires that you modify  your  ECR  repository
                   policy to trust CodeBuild service principal.

                 o SERVICE_ROLE  specifies  that  CodeBuild  uses  your  build
                   project's service role.

                 When you use a cross-account or private registry  image,  you
                 must  use SERVICE_ROLE credentials. When you use an CodeBuild
                 curated image, you must use CODEBUILD credentials.

          serviceRole -> (string)
              The name of a service role used for builds in the batch.

          logConfig -> (structure)
              Information about logs for a build project. These can be logs in
              CloudWatch Logs, built in a specified S3 bucket, or both.

              cloudWatchLogs -> (structure)
                 Information about CloudWatch Logs for a build project. Cloud-
                 Watch Logs are enabled by default.

                 status -> (string)
                     The current status of the logs in CloudWatch Logs  for  a
                     build project. Valid values are:

                     o ENABLED  :  CloudWatch  Logs are enabled for this build
                       project.

                     o DISABLED : CloudWatch Logs are  not  enabled  for  this
                       build project.

                 groupName -> (string)
                     The  group  name of the logs in CloudWatch Logs. For more
                     information, see Working with Log Groups and Log  Streams
                     .

                 streamName -> (string)
                     The prefix of the stream name of the CloudWatch Logs. For
                     more information, see Working with  Log  Groups  and  Log
                     Streams .

              s3Logs -> (structure)
                 Information  about  logs  built  to  an S3 bucket for a build
                 project. S3 logs are not enabled by default.

                 status -> (string)
                     The current status of the S3  build  logs.  Valid  values
                     are:

                     o ENABLED  :  S3  build  logs  are enabled for this build
                       project.

                     o DISABLED : S3 build logs are not enabled for this build
                       project.

                 location -> (string)
                     The  ARN of an S3 bucket and the path prefix for S3 logs.
                     If your Amazon S3 bucket name is  my-bucket  ,  and  your
                     path  prefix  is  build-log , then acceptable formats are
                     my-bucket/build-log or arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/build-log .

                 encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                     Set to true if you do not want your S3 build  log  output
                     encrypted. By default S3 build logs are encrypted.

                 bucketOwnerAccess -> (string)
                     Specifies  the bucket owner's access for objects that an-
                     other account uploads to their Amazon S3 bucket.  By  de-
                     fault,  only  the account that uploads the objects to the
                     bucket has access to these objects. This property  allows
                     you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

                     NOTE:
                        To use this property, your CodeBuild service role must
                        have the s3:PutBucketAcl permission.  This  permission
                        allows CodeBuild to modify the access control list for
                        the bucket.

                     This property can be one of the following values:
                        NONE

                     The bucket owner does not have  access  to  the  objects.
                     This is the default.
                        READ_ONLY

                     The bucket owner has read-only access to the objects. The
                     uploading account retains ownership of the objects.
                        FULL

                     The bucket owner has full access to the  objects.  Object
                     ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                     o If  the bucket is configured with the Bucket owner pre-
                       ferred setting, the bucket owner owns the objects.  The
                       uploading  account will have object access as specified
                       by the bucket's policy.

                     o Otherwise, the uploading account retains  ownership  of
                       the objects.

                     For  more  information  about Amazon S3 object ownership,
                     see Controlling ownership of uploaded  objects  using  S3
                     Object  Ownership  in  the  Amazon Simple Storage Service
                     User Guide .

          buildTimeoutInMinutes -> (integer)
              Specifies the maximum amount of time, in minutes, that the build
              in a batch must be completed in.

          queuedTimeoutInMinutes -> (integer)
              Specifies  the  amount of time, in minutes, that the batch build
              is allowed to be queued before it times out.

          complete -> (boolean)
              Indicates if the batch build is complete.

          initiator -> (string)
              The entity that started the batch build. Valid values include:

              o If CodePipeline started the build, the  pipeline's  name  (for
                example, codepipeline/my-demo-pipeline ).

              o If an IAM user started the build, the user's name.

              o If  the  Jenkins  plugin  for CodeBuild started the build, the
                string CodeBuild-Jenkins-Plugin .

          vpcConfig -> (structure)
              Information about the VPC configuration that CodeBuild accesses.

              vpcId -> (string)

              subnets -> (list)
                 A list of one or more subnet IDs in your Amazon VPC.

                 (string)

              securityGroupIds -> (list)
                 A list of one or more security groups IDs in your Amazon VPC.

                 (string)

          encryptionKey -> (string)
              The Key Management Service customer master key (CMK) to be  used
              for encrypting the batch build output artifacts.

              NOTE:
                 You can use a cross-account KMS key to encrypt the build out-
                 put artifacts if your service role  has  permission  to  that
                 key.

              You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK
              or,  if  available,  the   CMK's   alias   (using   the   format
              alias/<alias-name> ).

          buildBatchNumber -> (long)
              The number of the batch build. For each project, the buildBatch-
              Number of its first batch build is 1 . The  buildBatchNumber  of
              each  subsequent  batch  build  is incremented by 1 . If a batch
              build is deleted, the buildBatchNumber  of  other  batch  builds
              does not change.

          fileSystemLocations -> (list)
              An  array  of  ProjectFileSystemLocation  objects  for the batch
              build project. A ProjectFileSystemLocation object specifies  the
              identifier  , location , mountOptions , mountPoint , and type of
              a file system created using Amazon Elastic File System.

              (structure)
                 Information about a file system  created  by  Amazon  Elastic
                 File  System  (EFS). For more information, see What Is Amazon
                 Elastic File System?

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of the file system. The one  supported  type  is
                     EFS .

                 location -> (string)
                     A  string  that specifies the location of the file system
                     created by Amazon EFS. Its format is efs-dns-name:/direc-
                     tory-path . You can find the DNS name of file system when
                     you view it in the Amazon EFS console. The directory path
                     is  a  path  to a directory in the file system that Code-
                     Build mounts. For example, if the DNS name of a file sys-
                     tem  is fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com , and its
                     mount directory is my-efs-mount-directory , then the  lo-
                     cation        is        fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazon-
                     aws.com:/my-efs-mount-directory .

                     The directory path  in  the  format  efs-dns-name:/direc-
                     tory-path  is optional. If you do not specify a directory
                     path, the location is only the  DNS  name  and  CodeBuild
                     mounts the entire file system.

                 mountPoint -> (string)
                     The  location  in  the container where you mount the file
                     system.

                 identifier -> (string)
                     The name used to access a file system created  by  Amazon
                     EFS. CodeBuild creates an environment variable by append-
                     ing the identifier in all capital letters to CODEBUILD_ .
                     For example, if you specify my_efs for identifier , a new
                     environment variable is create named CODEBUILD_MY_EFS .

                     The identifier is used to mount your file system.

                 mountOptions -> (string)
                     The mount options for a file  system  created  by  Amazon
                     EFS.  The  default  mount  options  used by CodeBuild are
                     nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,re-
                     trans=2 . For more information, see Recommended NFS Mount
                     Options .

          buildBatchConfig -> (structure)
              Contains configuration information about a batch build project.

              serviceRole -> (string)
                 Specifies the service role ARN for the batch build project.

              combineArtifacts -> (boolean)
                 Specifies if the build artifacts for the batch  build  should
                 be combined into a single artifact location.

              restrictions -> (structure)
                 A  BatchRestrictions  object  that specifies the restrictions
                 for the batch build.

                 maximumBuildsAllowed -> (integer)
                     Specifies the maximum number of builds allowed.

                 computeTypesAllowed -> (list)
                     An array of strings that specify the compute  types  that
                     are  allowed  for  the batch build. See Build environment
                     compute types in the CodeBuild User Guide for these  val-
                     ues.

                     (string)

              timeoutInMins -> (integer)
                 Specifies  the  maximum  amount of time, in minutes, that the
                 batch build must be completed in.

              batchReportMode -> (string)
                 Specifies how build status reports are  sent  to  the  source
                 provider for the batch build. This property is only used when
                 the source provider for your project is Bitbucket, GitHub, or
                 GitHub  Enterprise,  and your project is configured to report
                 build statuses to the source provider.
                     REPORT_AGGREGATED_BATCH

                 (Default) Aggregate all of the build statuses into  a  single
                 status report.
                     REPORT_INDIVIDUAL_BUILDS
