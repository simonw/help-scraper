LIST-REPORTS()                                                  LIST-REPORTS()



NAME
       list-reports -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of ARNs for the reports in the current Amazon Web Ser-
       vices account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-reports is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: reports

SYNOPSIS
            list-reports
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --sort-order (string)
          Specifies  the  sort  order  for the list of returned reports. Valid
          values are:

          o ASCENDING : return reports in chronological order based  on  their
            creation date.

          o DESCENDING  :  return  reports  in the reverse chronological order
            based on their creation date.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --filter (structure)
          A ReportFilter object used to filter the returned reports.

          status -> (string)
              The status used to filter reports. You can filter using one sta-
              tus only.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          status=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "status": "GENERATING"|"SUCCEEDED"|"FAILED"|"INCOMPLETE"|"DELETING"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get a list of the reports for the current account in AWS CodeBuild.

       The following list-reports example retrieves the ARNs  of  the  reports
       for the current account.

          aws codebuild list-reports

       Output:

          {
              "reports": [
                  "arn:aws:codebuild:<region-ID>:<user-ID>:report/<report-group-name>:<report ID>",
                  "arn:aws:codebuild:<region-ID>:<user-ID>:report/<report-group-name>:<report ID>",
                  "arn:aws:codebuild:<region-ID>:<user-ID>:report/<report-group-name>:<report ID>"
              ]
          }

       For  more  information,  see  Working with reports in the AWS CodeBuild
       User Guide.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          During a previous call, the maximum number of items that can be  re-
          turned is the value specified in maxResults . If there more items in
          the list, then a unique string called a nextToken  is  returned.  To
          get  the next batch of items in the list, call this operation again,
          adding the next token to the call. To get all of the  items  in  the
          list,  keep  calling  this operation with each subsequent next token
          that is returned, until no more next tokens are returned.

       reports -> (list)
          The list of returned ARNs for the reports in the current Amazon  Web
          Services account.

          (string)
