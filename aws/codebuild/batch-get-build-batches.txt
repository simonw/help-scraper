OPTIONS
       --ids (list)
          An array that contains the batch build identifiers to retrieve.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                               An  explanation  of  the build phase's context.
                               This might include a command  ID  and  an  exit
                               code.

              source -> (structure)
                 Information  about  the build input source code for the build
                 project.

                     o BITBUCKET  :  The source code is in a Bitbucket reposi-
                       tory.

                     o CODECOMMIT : The source code is in an CodeCommit repos-
                       itory.

                     o CODEPIPELINE  :  The source code settings are specified
                       in the source action of a pipeline in CodePipeline.

                     o GITHUB : The source code is in a GitHub repository.

                     o GITHUB_ENTERPRISE : The source code is in a GitHub  En-
                       terprise Server repository.

                     o GITLAB : The source code is in a GitLab repository.

                     o GITLAB_SELF_MANAGED : The source code is in a self-man-
                       aged GitLab repository.

                     o NO_SOURCE : The project  does  not  have  input  source
                       code.

                     o S3 : The source code is in an Amazon S3 bucket.

                 location -> (string)
                     Information  about  the location of the source code to be
                     built. Valid values include:

                     o For source code settings  that  are  specified  in  the
                       source  action  of a pipeline in CodePipeline, location
                       should not be specified.  If  it  is  specified,  Code-
                       Pipeline  ignores it. This is because CodePipeline uses
                       the settings in a pipeline's source action  instead  of
                       this value.

                     o For  source code in an CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS
                       clone URL to the repository that  contains  the  source
                       code    and    the   buildspec   file   (for   example,
                       https://git-codecommit.<region-ID>.amazonaws.com/v1/re-
                       pos/<repo-name> ).

                     o For  source  code  in an Amazon S3 input bucket, one of
                       the following.

                       o The path to the ZIP file  that  contains  the  source
                         code    (for    example,    <bucket-name>/<path>/<ob-
                         ject-name>.zip ).

                       o The path to the folder that contains the source  code
                         (for                                         example,
                         <bucket-name>/<path-to-source-code>/<folder>/ ).

                     o For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone
                       URL  to the repository that contains the source and the
                       buildspec file. You must connect your Amazon  Web  Ser-
                       vices account to your GitHub account. Use the CodeBuild
                       console to start creating a build project. When you use
                       the  console  to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on
                       the GitHub Authorize application page, for Organization
                       access  , choose Request access next to each repository
                       you want to allow CodeBuild to have access to, and then
                       choose  Authorize  application  .  (After you have con-
                       nected to your GitHub account, you do not need to  fin-
                       ish creating the build project. You can leave the Code-
                       Build console.) To instruct CodeBuild to use this  con-
                       nection,  in  the  source object, set the auth object's
                       type value to OAUTH .

                     o For source code in an  GitLab  or  self-managed  GitLab
                       repository,  the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that
                       contains the source and the buildspec  file.  You  must
                       connect your Amazon Web Services account to your GitLab
                       account. Use the CodeBuild console to start creating  a
                       build  project. When you use the console to connect (or
                       reconnect) with GitLab, on  the  Connections  Authorize
                       application  page, choose Authorize . Then on the Code-
                       Connections Create GitLab connection page, choose  Con-
                       nect to GitLab . (After you have connected to your Git-
                       Lab account, you do not need  to  finish  creating  the
                       build project. You can leave the CodeBuild console.) To
                       instruct CodeBuild to override the  default  connection
                       and  use this connection instead, set the auth object's
                       type value to CODECONNECTIONS in the source object.

                     o For source code in a Bitbucket  repository,  the  HTTPS
                       clone  URL  to  the repository that contains the source
                       and the buildspec file. You must  connect  your  Amazon
                       Web Services account to your Bitbucket account. Use the
                       CodeBuild console to start creating  a  build  project.
                       When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with
                       Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket Confirm access to your  ac-
                       count  page, choose Grant access . (After you have con-
                       nected to your Bitbucket account, you do  not  need  to
                       finish  creating  the  build project. You can leave the
                       CodeBuild console.) To instruct CodeBuild to  use  this
                       connection, in the source object, set the auth object's
                       type value to OAUTH .

                     If you specify CODEPIPELINE for the Type property,  don't
                     specify  this  property.  For all of the other types, you
                     must specify Location .

                 gitCloneDepth -> (integer)
                     Information about the  Git  clone  depth  for  the  build
                     project.

                 gitSubmodulesConfig -> (structure)
                     Information  about  the  Git submodules configuration for
                     the build project.

                     fetchSubmodules -> (boolean)
                        Set to true to fetch Git submodules for your CodeBuild
                        build project.

                 buildspec -> (string)
                     The  buildspec  file declaration to use for the builds in
                     this build project.

                     If this value is set, it can be either an  inline  build-
                     spec  definition, the path to an alternate buildspec file
                     relative to the value of the  built-in  CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR
                     environment  variable,  or  the path to an S3 bucket. The
                     bucket must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region  as
                     the  build  project. Specify the buildspec file using its
                     ARN    (for    example,    arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sam-
                     ple2/buildspec.yml ). If this value is not provided or is
                     set to an empty string, the source code  must  contain  a
                     buildspec  file  in its root directory. For more informa-
                     tion, see Buildspec File Name and Storage Location .

                 auth -> (structure)
                     Information about the authorization  settings  for  Code-
                     Build to access the source code to be built.

                     This information is for the CodeBuild console's use only.
                     Your code should not get  or  set  this  information  di-
                     rectly.

                     type -> (string)
                        The authorization type to use. Valid options are OAUTH
                        or CODECONNECTIONS.

                     resource -> (string)
                        The resource value that applies to the  specified  au-
                        thorization type.

                 reportBuildStatus -> (boolean)
                     Set  to  true to report the status of a build's start and
                     finish to your source provider. This option is valid only
                     when  your  source provider is GitHub, GitHub Enterprise,
                     GitLab, GitLab Self Managed, or Bitbucket. If this is set
                     and  you use a different source provider, an invalidInpu-
                     tException is thrown.

                     To be able to report  the  build  status  to  the  source
                     provider,  the  user  associated with the source provider
                     must have write access to the repo. If the user does  not
                     have  write  access,  the build status cannot be updated.
                     For more information, see Source provider access  in  the
                     CodeBuild User Guide .

                     The  status  of  a build triggered by a webhook is always
                     reported to your source provider.

                     If your project's builds are triggered by a webhook,  you
                     must  push  a new commit to the repo for a change to this
                     property to take effect.

                 buildStatusConfig -> (structure)
                     Contains information that defines how the  build  project
                     reports the build status to the source provider. This op-
                     tion is only used when the source provider  is  GITHUB  ,
                     GITHUB_ENTERPRISE , or BITBUCKET .

                     context -> (string)
                        Specifies  the  context  of the build status CodeBuild
                        sends to the source provider. The usage of this param-
                        eter depends on the source provider.
                            Bitbucket

                        This  parameter  is used for the name parameter in the

                     Information  about  the  build  input source code for the
                     build project.

                     type -> (string)
                        The type of repository that contains the  source  code
                        to be built. Valid values include:

                        o BITBUCKET : The source code is in a Bitbucket repos-
                          itory.

                        o CODECOMMIT : The source code  is  in  an  CodeCommit
                          repository.

                          o The  path  to  the folder that contains the source
                            code                 (for                 example,
                            <bucket-name>/<path-to-source-code>/<folder>/ ).

                          Web Services account to your GitHub account. Use the
                          CodeBuild console to start creating a build project.
                          When you use the console to connect  (or  reconnect)
                          with  GitHub,  on  the  GitHub Authorize application
                          page, for Organization access , choose  Request  ac-
                          cess next to each repository you want to allow Code-
                          Build to have access to, and then  choose  Authorize
                          application  .  (After  you  have  connected to your
                          GitHub account, you do not need to  finish  creating
                          the  build project. You can leave the CodeBuild con-
                          sole.) To instruct CodeBuild to use this connection,
                          in  the  source  object,  set the auth object's type
                          value to OAUTH .

                        o For source code in an GitLab or self-managed  GitLab
                          repository,  the  HTTPS  clone URL to the repository
                          that contains the source and the buildspec file. You
                          must  connect  your  Amazon  Web Services account to
                          your GitLab account. Use the  CodeBuild  console  to
                          start  creating  a  build  project. When you use the
                          console to connect (or reconnect)  with  GitLab,  on
                          the  Connections  Authorize application page, choose
                          Authorize . Then on the CodeConnections Create  Git-
                          Lab connection page, choose Connect to GitLab . (Af-
                          ter you have connected to your GitLab  account,  you
                          do  not  need  to finish creating the build project.
                          You can leave the CodeBuild  console.)  To  instruct
                          CodeBuild to override the default connection and use
                          this connection instead, set the auth object's  type
                          value to CODECONNECTIONS in the source object.

                        o For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS
                          clone URL to the repository that contains the source
                          and the buildspec file. You must connect your Amazon
                          Web Services account to your Bitbucket account.  Use
                          the  CodeBuild  console  to  start  creating a build
                          project. When you use the console to connect (or re-
                          connect)  with  Bitbucket,  on the Bitbucket Confirm
                          access to your account page, choose Grant  access  .
                          (After you have connected to your Bitbucket account,
                          you  do  not  need  to  finish  creating  the  build
                          project.  You  can  leave the CodeBuild console.) To
                          instruct CodeBuild to use this  connection,  in  the
                          source  object,  set the auth object's type value to
                          OAUTH .

                        If you specify CODEPIPELINE  for  the  Type  property,
                        don't  specify  this  property.  For  all of the other
                        types, you must specify Location .

                     gitCloneDepth -> (integer)
                        Information about the Git clone depth  for  the  build
                        project.

                     gitSubmodulesConfig -> (structure)
                        Information about the Git submodules configuration for
                        the build project.

                     buildspec -> (string)
                        The  buildspec  file declaration to use for the builds
                        in this build project.

                        If this value is set,  it  can  be  either  an  inline
                        buildspec  definition, the path to an alternate build-
                        spec file relative to the value of the built-in  CODE-
                        BUILD_SRC_DIR  environment variable, or the path to an
                        S3 bucket. The bucket must be in the same  Amazon  Web
                        Services  Region  as  the  build  project. Specify the
                        buildspec   file   using   its   ARN   (for   example,
                        arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml  ). If
                        this value is not provided  or  is  set  to  an  empty
                        string,  the source code must contain a buildspec file
                        in its  root  directory.  For  more  information,  see
                        Buildspec File Name and Storage Location .

                     auth -> (structure)
                        Information about the authorization settings for Code-
                        Build to access the source code to be built.

                        This information is for the  CodeBuild  console's  use
                        only. Your code should not get or set this information
                        directly.

                        type -> (string)
                            The authorization type to use. Valid  options  are
                            OAUTH or CODECONNECTIONS.

                        resource -> (string)
                            The  resource  value that applies to the specified
                            authorization type.

                     reportBuildStatus -> (boolean)
                        Set to true to report the status of  a  build's  start
                        and  finish  to  your  source provider. This option is
                        valid only when your source provider is GitHub, GitHub
                        Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self Managed, or Bitbucket.
                        If  this  is  set  and  you  use  a  different  source
                        provider, an invalidInputException is thrown.

                        To  be  able  to report the build status to the source
                        provider, the user associated with the source provider
                        must  have  write access to the repo. If the user does
                        not have write access, the build status cannot be  up-
                        dated.  For  more information, see Source provider ac-
                        cess in the CodeBuild User Guide .

                        The status of a build triggered by a webhook is always
                        reported to your source provider.

                        If  your  project's builds are triggered by a webhook,
                        you must push a new commit to the repo for a change to
                        this property to take effect.

                     buildStatusConfig -> (structure)
                        Contains   information  that  defines  how  the  build
                        project  reports  the  build  status  to  the   source
                        provider.  This  option  is  only used when the source
                        provider is GITHUB , GITHUB_ENTERPRISE , or  BITBUCKET
                        .

                        context -> (string)
                            Specifies  the  context  of the build status Code-
                            Build sends to the source provider. The  usage  of
                            this parameter depends on the source provider.
                               Bitbucket

                            This  parameter  is used for the name parameter in
                            the Bitbucket commit status. For more information,

                 o For GitHub: the commit ID, pull request ID, branch name, or
                   tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code
                   you want to build. If a pull request ID  is  specified,  it
                   must  use the format pr/pull-request-ID (for example, pr/25
                   ). If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD  commit
                   ID  is  used.  If  not specified, the default branch's HEAD
                   commit ID is used.

                 o For Bitbucket: the commit ID, branch name, or tag name that
                   corresponds  to  the version of the source code you want to
                   build. If a branch name is  specified,  the  branch's  HEAD
                   commit  ID  is used. If not specified, the default branch's
                   HEAD commit ID is used.

                 o For Amazon S3: the version ID of the object that represents
                   the build input ZIP file to use.

                 (structure)
                     A source identifier and its corresponding version.

                     sourceIdentifier -> (string)
                        An  identifier  for a source in the build project. The
                        identifier can only  contain  alphanumeric  characters
                        and  underscores, and must be less than 128 characters
                        in length.

                     sourceVersion -> (string)
                        The source version for the corresponding source  iden-
                        tifier. If specified, must be one of:

                        o For CodeCommit: the commit ID, branch, or Git tag to
                          use.

                        o For GitHub or GitLab: the commit  ID,  pull  request
                          ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the
                          version of the source code you want to build.  If  a
                          pull request ID is specified, it must use the format
                          pr/pull-request-ID  (for  example,  pr/25  ).  If  a
                          branch  name  is specified, the branch's HEAD commit
                          ID is used. If not specified, the  default  branch's
                          HEAD commit ID is used.

                        o For  Bitbucket:  the  commit ID, branch name, or tag
                          name that corresponds to the version of  the  source
                          code  you  want to build. If a branch name is speci-
                          fied, the branch's HEAD commit ID is  used.  If  not
                          specified,  the  default  branch's HEAD commit ID is
                          used.

                        o For Amazon S3: the version ID  of  the  object  that
                          represents the build input ZIP file to use.

                        For  more  information, see Source Version Sample with

              artifacts -> (structure)
                 A BuildArtifacts object the defines the build  artifacts  for
                 this batch build.

                 location -> (string)
                     Information about the location of the build artifacts.

                 sha256sum -> (string)
                     The SHA-256 hash of the build artifact.

                     You  can use this hash along with a checksum tool to con-
                     firm file integrity and authenticity.

                     NOTE:
                        This value is available only if  the  build  project's
                        packaging value is set to ZIP .

                 md5sum -> (string)
                     The MD5 hash of the build artifact.

                     You  can use this hash along with a checksum tool to con-
                     firm file integrity and authenticity.

                     NOTE:
                        This value is available only if  the  build  project's
                        packaging value is set to ZIP .

                 overrideArtifactName -> (boolean)
                     If  this  flag  is set, a name specified in the buildspec
                     file overrides the artifact name. The name specified in a
                     buildspec  file  is calculated at build time and uses the
                     Shell Command Language. For example,  you  can  append  a
                     date  and time to your artifact name so that it is always
                     unique.

                 encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                     Information that tells you if encryption for build  arti-
                     facts is disabled.

                 artifactIdentifier -> (string)
                     An identifier for this artifact definition.

                 bucketOwnerAccess -> (string)
                     Specifies  the bucket owner's access for objects that an-
                     other account uploads to their Amazon S3 bucket.  By  de-
                     fault,  only  the account that uploads the objects to the
                     bucket has access to these objects. This property  allows
                     you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

                     NOTE:
                        To use this property, your CodeBuild service role must
                        have the s3:PutBucketAcl permission.  This  permission
                        allows CodeBuild to modify the access control list for
                        the bucket.

                     This property can be one of the following values:
                        NONE

                     The bucket owner does not have  access  to  the  objects.
                     This is the default.
                        READ_ONLY

                     The bucket owner has read-only access to the objects. The
                     uploading account retains ownership of the objects.
                        FULL

                     The bucket owner has full access to the  objects.  Object
                     ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                     o If  the bucket is configured with the Bucket owner pre-
                       ferred setting, the bucket owner owns the objects.  The
                       uploading  account will have object access as specified
                       by the bucket's policy.

                     o Otherwise, the uploading account retains  ownership  of
                       the objects.

              secondaryArtifacts -> (list)
                 An array of BuildArtifacts objects the define the build arti-
                 facts for this batch build.

                 (structure)
                     Information about build output artifacts.

                     location -> (string)
                        Information about the location of the build artifacts.

                     sha256sum -> (string)
                        The SHA-256 hash of the build artifact.

                        You  can  use  this hash along with a checksum tool to
                        confirm file integrity and authenticity.

                        NOTE:
                            This  value  is  available  only  if   the   build
                            project's packaging value is set to ZIP .

                     md5sum -> (string)
                        The MD5 hash of the build artifact.

                        You  can  use  this hash along with a checksum tool to
                        confirm file integrity and authenticity.

                        NOTE:
                            This  value  is  available  only  if   the   build
                            project's packaging value is set to ZIP .

                     overrideArtifactName -> (boolean)
                        If this flag is set, a name specified in the buildspec
                        file overrides the artifact name. The  name  specified
                        in  a  buildspec  file is calculated at build time and
                        uses the Shell Command Language. For example, you  can
                        append  a  date and time to your artifact name so that
                        it is always unique.

                     encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                        Information that tells you if encryption for build ar-
                        tifacts is disabled.

                     artifactIdentifier -> (string)
                        An identifier for this artifact definition.

                     bucketOwnerAccess -> (string)
                        Specifies  the  bucket owner's access for objects that
                        another account uploads to their Amazon S3 bucket.  By
                        default,  only the account that uploads the objects to
                        the bucket has access to these objects. This  property
                        allows  you  to  give the bucket owner access to these
                        objects.

                        NOTE:
                            To use this property, your CodeBuild service  role
                            must  have  the  s3:PutBucketAcl  permission. This
                            permission allows CodeBuild to modify  the  access
                            control list for the bucket.

                        This property can be one of the following values:
                            NONE

                        The  bucket owner does not have access to the objects.
                        This is the default.
                            READ_ONLY

                        The bucket owner has read-only access to the  objects.
                        The  uploading  account  retains  ownership of the ob-
                        jects.
                            FULL

                        The bucket owner has full access to the  objects.  Ob-
                        ject  ownership  is determined by the following crite-
                        ria:

                        o If the bucket is configured with  the  Bucket  owner
                          preferred  setting,  the  bucket  owner owns the ob-
                          jects. The uploading account will have object access
                          as specified by the bucket's policy.

                        o Otherwise,  the  uploading account retains ownership
                          of the objects.

              cache -> (structure)
                 Information about the cache for the build project.

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of cache used by the build project. Valid values
                     include:

                     o NO_CACHE : The build project does not use any cache.

                     o S3 : The build project reads and writes from and to S3.

                     o LOCAL : The build project stores a cache locally  on  a
                       build host that is only available to that build host.

                 location -> (string)
                     Information about the cache location:

                     o NO_CACHE or LOCAL : This value is ignored.

                     o S3 : This is the S3 bucket name/prefix.

                 modes -> (list)
                     An  array  of strings that specify the local cache modes.
                     You can use one or more local cache  modes  at  the  same
                     time. This is only used for LOCAL cache types.

                     Possible values are:
                        LOCAL_SOURCE_CACHE

                     Caches  Git  metadata  for primary and secondary sources.
                     After the cache is created, subsequent builds  pull  only
                     the  change  between  commits. This mode is a good choice
                     for projects with a clean working directory and a  source
                     that is a large Git repository. If you choose this option
                     and your project does not use a Git  repository  (GitHub,
                     GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket), the option is ignored.
                        LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE

                     Caches existing Docker layers. This mode is a good choice
                     for projects that build or pull large Docker  images.  It
                     can  prevent  the  performance  issues  caused by pulling
                     large Docker images down from the network.

                     NOTE:

                        o You can use a Docker layer cache in the Linux  envi-
                          ronment only.

                        o The privileged flag must be set so that your project
                          has the required Docker permissions.

                        o You should consider the security implications before
                          you use a Docker layer cache.

                        LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE

                     Caches  directories  you  specify  in the buildspec file.
                     This mode is a good choice if your build scenario is  not
                     suited  to  one  of the other three local cache modes. If
                     you use a custom cache:

                     o Only directories can be specified for caching. You can-
                       not specify individual files.

                     o Symlinks are used to reference cached directories.

                     o Cached  directories  are linked to your build before it
                       downloads its project sources. Cached items  are  over-
                       ridden  if a source item has the same name. Directories
                       are specified using cache paths in the buildspec file.

                     (string)

              environment -> (structure)
                 Information about the build environment of the build project.

                     The image tag or image digest that identifies the  Docker
                     image  to  use  for this build project. Use the following
                     formats:

                     o For an image tag: <registry>/<repository>:<tag>  .  For
                       example,  in  the Docker repository that CodeBuild uses
                       to manage its Docker images, this  would  be  aws/code-
                       build/standard:4.0 .

                     o For an image digest: <registry>/<repository>@<digest> .
                       For example,  to  specify  an  image  with  the  digest
                       "sha256:cbbf2f9a99b47fc460d422812b6a5adff7dfee951d8fa2e4a98caa0382cf-

                        value -> (string)
                            The value of the environment variable.

                            WARNING:
                               We strongly discourage the use of PLAINTEXT en-
                               vironment variables to store sensitive  values,
                               especially  Amazon Web Services secret key IDs.
                               PLAINTEXT environment  variables  can  be  dis-
                               played  in  plain text using the CodeBuild con-
                               sole and the CLI. For sensitive values, we rec-
                               ommend  you use an environment variable of type
                               PARAMETER_STORE or SECRETS_MANAGER .

                        type -> (string)
                            The type of environment variable. Valid values in-
                            clude:

                            o PARAMETER_STORE : An environment variable stored
                              in Systems Manager Parameter Store. For environ-
                              ment variables of this type, specify the name of
                              the parameter as the value of  the  Environment-
                              Variable.  The  parameter  value will be substi-
                              tuted for the name at runtime. You can also  de-
                              fine  Parameter  Store  environment variables in
                              the buildspec.  To  learn  how  to  do  so,  see
                              env/parameter-store  in the CodeBuild User Guide
                              .

                            o PLAINTEXT : An  environment  variable  in  plain
                              text format. This is the default value.

                            o SECRETS_MANAGER : An environment variable stored
                              in Secrets Manager. For environment variables of
                              this type, specify the name of the secret as the
                              value of  the  EnvironmentVariable.  The  secret
                              value  will  be substituted for the name at run-
                              time. You can also define Secrets Manager  envi-
                              ronment variables in the buildspec. To learn how
                              to do so, see env/secrets-manager in  the  Code-
                              Build User Guide .

                 privilegedMode -> (boolean)
                     Enables  running  the  Docker daemon inside a Docker con-
                     tainer. Set to true only if the build project is used  to
                     build  Docker images. Otherwise, a build that attempts to
                     interact with the Docker daemon fails. The  default  set-
                     ting is false .

                     You  can  initialize the Docker daemon during the install
                     phase of your build by adding one of the  following  sets
                     of commands to the install phase of your buildspec file:

                     If the operating system's base image is Ubuntu Linux:
                        -             nohup             /usr/local/bin/dockerd
                        --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock
                        --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&

                        -  timeout  15  sh  -c  "until docker info; do echo .;
                        sleep 1; done"

                     If the operating system's base image is Alpine Linux  and
                     the  previous  command does not work, add the -t argument
                     to timeout :
                        -             nohup             /usr/local/bin/dockerd
                        --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock
                        --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&

                        - timeout -t 15 sh -c "until docker info; do  echo  .;
                        sleep 1; done"

                 certificate -> (string)
                     The  ARN of the Amazon S3 bucket, path prefix, and object
                     key that contains the  PEM-encoded  certificate  for  the
                     build  project.  For more information, see certificate in
                     the CodeBuild User Guide .

                 registryCredential -> (structure)
                     The credentials for access to a private registry.

                     credential -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or name of  credentials
                        created using Secrets Manager.

                        NOTE:
                            The credential can use the name of the credentials
                            only if they exist in your current Amazon Web Ser-
                            vices Region.

                     credentialProvider -> (string)
                        The  service  that created the credentials to access a
                        private Docker registry. The valid value, SECRETS_MAN-
                        AGER, is for Secrets Manager.

                 imagePullCredentialsType -> (string)
                     The  type of credentials CodeBuild uses to pull images in
                     your build. There are two valid values:

                     o CODEBUILD specifies that CodeBuild uses its own creden-
                       tials.  This  requires that you modify your ECR reposi-
                       tory policy to trust CodeBuild service principal.

                     o SERVICE_ROLE specifies that CodeBuild uses  your  build
                       project's service role.

                     When  you  use a cross-account or private registry image,
                     you must use SERVICE_ROLE credentials. When  you  use  an
                     CodeBuild  curated  image, you must use CODEBUILD creden-
                     tials.

              serviceRole -> (string)
                 The name of a service role used for builds in the batch.

                 cloudWatchLogs -> (structure)
                     Information  about  CloudWatch  Logs for a build project.
                     CloudWatch Logs are enabled by default.

                     status -> (string)
                        The current status of the logs in CloudWatch Logs  for
                        a build project. Valid values are:

                        o ENABLED : CloudWatch Logs are enabled for this build
                          project.

                        o DISABLED : CloudWatch Logs are not enabled for  this
                          build project.

                     groupName -> (string)

                        logs. If your Amazon S3 bucket name is my-bucket , and
                        your  path  prefix is build-log , then acceptable for-
                        mats        are         my-bucket/build-log         or
                        arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/build-log .

                     encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                        Set  to true if you do not want your S3 build log out-

                        default, only the account that uploads the objects  to
                        the  bucket has access to these objects. This property
                        allows you to give the bucket owner  access  to  these
                        objects.

                        NOTE:
                            To  use this property, your CodeBuild service role
                            must have  the  s3:PutBucketAcl  permission.  This
                            permission  allows  CodeBuild to modify the access
                            control list for the bucket.

                        This property can be one of the following values:
                            NONE

                        The bucket owner does not have access to the  objects.
                        This is the default.
                            READ_ONLY

                        The  bucket owner has read-only access to the objects.
                        The uploading account retains  ownership  of  the  ob-
                        jects.
                            FULL

                        The  bucket  owner has full access to the objects. Ob-
                        ject ownership is determined by the  following  crite-
                        ria:

                        o If  the  bucket  is configured with the Bucket owner
                          preferred setting, the bucket  owner  owns  the  ob-
                          jects. The uploading account will have object access
                          as specified by the bucket's policy.

                        o Otherwise, the uploading account  retains  ownership
                          of the objects.

              initiator -> (string)
                 The entity that started the batch  build.  Valid  values  in-
                 clude:

                 o If CodePipeline started the build, the pipeline's name (for
                   example, codepipeline/my-demo-pipeline ).

                 o If a user started the build, the user's name.

                 o If the Jenkins plugin for CodeBuild started the build,  the
                   string CodeBuild-Jenkins-Plugin .

              vpcConfig -> (structure)
                 Information  about  the  VPC configuration that CodeBuild ac-
                 cesses.

                 vpcId -> (string)

                     (string)

              encryptionKey -> (string)
                 The  Key  Management  Service customer master key (CMK) to be
                 used for encrypting the batch build output artifacts.

                 NOTE:
                     You can use a cross-account KMS key to encrypt the  build
                     output  artifacts  if your service role has permission to
                     that key.

                 You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the
                 CMK  or,  if  available,  the  CMK's  alias (using the format
                 alias/<alias-name> ).

              buildBatchNumber -> (long)
                 The number of the batch build. For each project,  the  build-
                 BatchNumber  of  its first batch build is 1 . The buildBatch-
                 Number of each subsequent batch build is incremented by  1  .
                 If  a  batch  build is deleted, the buildBatchNumber of other
                 batch builds does not change.

              fileSystemLocations -> (list)
                 An array of ProjectFileSystemLocation objects for  the  batch
                 build  project.  A ProjectFileSystemLocation object specifies
                 the identifier , location , mountOptions , mountPoint  ,  and
                 type  of a file system created using Amazon Elastic File Sys-
                 tem.

                 (structure)
                     Information about a file system created by Amazon Elastic
                     File System (EFS). For more information, see What Is Ama-
                     zon Elastic File System?

                     type -> (string)
                        The type of the file system. The one supported type is
                        EFS .

                     location -> (string)
                        A  string that specifies the location of the file sys-
                        tem   created   by   Amazon   EFS.   Its   format   is
                        efs-dns-name:/directory-path  .  You  can find the DNS
                        name of file system when you view it in the Amazon EFS
                        console.  The  directory path is a path to a directory
                        in the file system that CodeBuild mounts. For example,
                        if    the    DNS    name   of   a   file   system   is
                        fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com  ,   and   its
                        mount  directory  is my-efs-mount-directory , then the
                        location     is      fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazon-
                        aws.com:/my-efs-mount-directory .

                        The  directory path in the format efs-dns-name:/direc-
                        tory-path is optional. If you do not specify a  direc-
                        tory path, the location is only the DNS name and Code-
                        Build mounts the entire file system.

                     mountPoint -> (string)
                        The location in the container where you mount the file
                        system.

                     identifier -> (string)
                        The  name used to access a file system created by Ama-
                        zon EFS. CodeBuild creates an environment variable  by
                        appending  the  identifier  in  all capital letters to
                        CODEBUILD_ . For example, if you  specify  my_efs  for
                        identifier  ,  a  new  environment  variable is create
                        named CODEBUILD_MY_EFS .

                        The identifier is used to mount your file system.

                     mountOptions -> (string)
                        The mount options for a file system created by  Amazon
                        EFS.  The  default mount options used by CodeBuild are
                        nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,re-
                        trans=2  .  For  more information, see Recommended NFS
                        Mount Options .

                     provider  for the batch build. This property is only used
                     when the source provider for your project  is  Bitbucket,
                     GitHub, or GitHub Enterprise, and your project is config-
                     ured to report build statuses to the source provider.
