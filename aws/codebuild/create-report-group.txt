       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-report-group
          --name <value>
          --type <value>
          --export-config <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the report group.

       --type (string)
          The type of report group.

          Possible values:

          o TEST

          o CODE_COVERAGE

       --export-config (structure)
          A ReportExportConfig object that contains  information  about  where
          the report group test results are exported.

          exportConfigType -> (string)
              The export configuration type. Valid values are:

              o S3 : The report results are exported to an S3 bucket.

              o NO_EXPORT : The report results are not exported.

          s3Destination -> (structure)
              A  S3ReportExportConfig  object  that contains information about
              the S3 bucket where the run of a report is exported.

              bucket -> (string)
                 The name of the S3 bucket where the raw data of a report  are
                 exported.

              bucketOwner -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web  Services account identifier of the owner of
                 the Amazon S3 bucket. This allows report data to be  exported
                 to an Amazon S3 bucket that is owned by an account other than
                 the account running the build.

              path -> (string)
                 The path to the exported report's raw data results.

              packaging -> (string)
                 The type of build output artifact to create. Valid values in-
                 clude:

                 o NONE : CodeBuild creates the raw data in the output bucket.
                   This is the default if packaging is not specified.

                 o ZIP : CodeBuild creates a ZIP file with the raw data in the
                   output bucket.

              encryptionKey -> (string)
                 The encryption key for the report's encrypted raw data.

              encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                 A boolean value that specifies if the results of a report are
                 encrypted.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          exportConfigType=string,s3Destination={bucket=string,bucketOwner=string,path=string,packaging=string,encryptionKey=string,encryptionDisabled=boolean}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "exportConfigType": "S3"|"NO_EXPORT",
            "s3Destination": {
              "bucket": "string",
              "bucketOwner": "string",
              "path": "string",
              "packaging": "ZIP"|"NONE",
              "encryptionKey": "string",
              "encryptionDisabled": true|false
            }
          }

       --tags (list)
          A list of tag key and value pairs associated with this report group.

          These tags are available for use by  Amazon  Web  Services  services
          that support CodeBuild report group tags.

          (structure)
              A tag, consisting of a key and a value.

              This  tag  is  available for use by Amazon Web Services services
              that support tags in CodeBuild.

              key -> (string)
                 The tag's key.

              value -> (string)
                 The tag's value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To create a report group in AWS CodeBuild.

       The following create-report-group example creates a new report group.

              --cli-input-json file://create-report-group-source.json

       Contents of create-report-group-source.json:

          {
              "name": "cli-created-report-group",
              "type": "TEST",
              "exportConfig": {
