SYNOPSIS
            stop-build-batch
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The identifier of the batch build to stop.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                     times of the batch build's phase.

                 contexts -> (list)
                     Additional information about the batch build phase. Espe-
                     cially to help troubleshoot a failed batch build.

                     (structure)
                        Additional information about a build phase that has an
                        error.  You can use this information for troubleshoot-
                        ing.

                        statusCode -> (string)
                            The status code  for  the  context  of  the  build
                            phase.

                        message -> (string)
                            An  explanation of the build phase's context. This
                            might include a command ID and an exit code.

          source -> (structure)
              Information about the build input  source  code  for  the  build
              project.

              type -> (string)
                 The  type  of  repository that contains the source code to be
                 built. Valid values include:

                 o BITBUCKET : The source code is in a Bitbucket repository.

                 o CODECOMMIT : The source code is in  an  CodeCommit  reposi-
                   tory.

                 o CODEPIPELINE  :  The  source code settings are specified in
                   the source action of a pipeline in CodePipeline.

                 o GITHUB : The source code is in a GitHub repository.

                 o GITHUB_ENTERPRISE : The source code is in a  GitHub  Enter-
                   prise Server repository.

                 o GITLAB : The source code is in a GitLab repository.

                 o GITLAB_SELF_MANAGED  : The source code is in a self-managed
                   GitLab repository.

                 o NO_SOURCE : The project does not have input source code.

                 o S3 : The source code is in an Amazon S3 bucket.

              location -> (string)
                 Information about the location  of  the  source  code  to  be
                 built. Valid values include:

                 o For  source  code settings that are specified in the source
                   action of a pipeline in CodePipeline, location  should  not
                   be  specified. If it is specified, CodePipeline ignores it.
                   This is because CodePipeline uses the settings in  a  pipe-
                   line's source action instead of this value.

                 o For  source  code  in  an  CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS
                   clone URL to the repository that contains the  source  code
                   and  the  buildspec file (for example, https://git-codecom-
                   mit.<region-ID>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/<repo-name> ).

                 o For source code in an Amazon S3 input bucket,  one  of  the
                   following.

                   o The  path  to  the ZIP file that contains the source code
                     (for example, <bucket-name>/<path>/<object-name>.zip ).

                   o The path to the folder that contains the source code (for
                     example, <bucket-name>/<path-to-source-code>/<folder>/ ).

                 o For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL
                   to the repository that contains the source and  the  build-
                   spec  file.  You  must connect your Amazon Web Services ac-
                   count to your GitHub account. Use the CodeBuild console  to
                   start creating a build project. When you use the console to
                   connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub Authorize
                   application  page, for Organization access , choose Request
                   access next to each repository you want to allow  CodeBuild
                   to  have access to, and then choose Authorize application .
                   (After you have connected to your GitHub  account,  you  do
                   not  need  to  finish  creating  the build project. You can
                   leave the CodeBuild console.) To instruct CodeBuild to  use
                   this  connection,  in  the  source object, set the auth ob-
                   ject's type value to OAUTH .

                 o For source code in an GitLab or self-managed GitLab reposi-
                   tory,  the  HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains
                   the source and the buildspec file. You  must  connect  your
                   Amazon Web Services account to your GitLab account. Use the
                   CodeBuild console to start creating a build  project.  When
                   you  use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitLab,
                   on the Connections Authorize application page,  choose  Au-
                   thorize  .  Then  on the CodeStar Connections Create GitLab
                   connection page, choose Connect to GitLab . (After you have
                   connected to your GitLab account, you do not need to finish
                   creating the build project. You  can  leave  the  CodeBuild
                   console.)  To  instruct  CodeBuild  to override the default
                   connection and use this connection instead,  set  the  auth
                   object's  type  value  to CODECONNECTIONS in the source ob-
                   ject.

                 o For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS  clone
                   URL  to  the  repository  that  contains the source and the
                   buildspec file. You must connect your Amazon  Web  Services
                   account  to  your Bitbucket account. Use the CodeBuild con-
                   sole to start creating a build project. When  you  use  the
                   console  to  connect  (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the
                   Bitbucket Confirm access to your account page, choose Grant
                   access  .  (After  you have connected to your Bitbucket ac-
                   count, you  do  not  need  to  finish  creating  the  build
                   project.  You can leave the CodeBuild console.) To instruct
                   CodeBuild to use this connection, in the source object, set
                   the auth object's type value to OAUTH .

                 If  you  specify  CODEPIPELINE  for  the Type property, don't
                 specify this property. For all of the other types,  you  must
                 specify Location .

              gitCloneDepth -> (integer)
                 Information about the Git clone depth for the build project.

              gitSubmodulesConfig -> (structure)
                 Information  about  the  Git submodules configuration for the
                 build project.

                 fetchSubmodules -> (boolean)
                     Set to true to fetch Git submodules  for  your  CodeBuild
                     build project.

              buildspec -> (string)
                 The  buildspec file declaration to use for the builds in this
                 build project.

                 If this value is set, it can be either  an  inline  buildspec
                 definition,  the path to an alternate buildspec file relative
                 to the value of the  built-in  CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR  environment
                 variable,  or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in
                 the same Amazon Web Services Region  as  the  build  project.
                 Specify  the  buildspec  file  using  its  ARN  (for example,
                 arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml  ).  If  this
                 value  is  not  provided  or  is  set to an empty string, the
                 source code must contain a buildspec file in its root  direc-
                 tory. For more information, see Buildspec File Name and Stor-
                 age Location .

              auth -> (structure)
                 Information about the authorization settings for CodeBuild to
                 access the source code to be built.

                 This  information  is  for  the CodeBuild console's use only.
                 Your code should not get or set this information directly.

                 type -> (string)
                     The authorization type to use. Valid options are OAUTH or
                     CODECONNECTIONS.

                 resource -> (string)
                     The  resource  value that applies to the specified autho-
                     rization type.

              reportBuildStatus -> (boolean)
                 Set to true to report the status of a build's start and  fin-
                 ish  to  your source provider. This option is valid only when
                 your source provider is GitHub,  GitHub  Enterprise,  GitLab,
                 GitLab Self Managed, or Bitbucket. If this is set and you use
                 a different  source  provider,  an  invalidInputException  is
                 thrown.

                 To be able to report the build status to the source provider,
                 the user associated with the source provider must have  write
                 access  to  the repo. If the user does not have write access,
                 the build status cannot be updated. For more information, see
                 Source provider access in the CodeBuild User Guide .

                 The  status  of  a build triggered by a webhook is always re-
                 ported to your source provider.

                 If your project's builds are triggered by a webhook, you must
                 push  a  new commit to the repo for a change to this property
                 to take effect.

              buildStatusConfig -> (structure)
                 Contains information that defines how the build  project  re-
                 ports the build status to the source provider. This option is
                 only used when the source provider is GITHUB ,  GITHUB_ENTER-
                 PRISE , or BITBUCKET .

                 context -> (string)
                     Specifies the context of the build status CodeBuild sends
                     to the source provider. The usage of this  parameter  de-
                     pends on the source provider.
                        Bitbucket

                     This parameter is used for the name parameter in the Bit-
                     bucket commit status. For more information, see build  in
                     the Bitbucket API documentation.
                        GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server

                     This  parameter  is used for the context parameter in the
                     GitHub commit status. For more information, see Create  a
                     commit status in the GitHub developer guide.

                 targetUrl -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  target  url of the build status CodeBuild
                     sends to the source provider. The usage of this parameter
                     depends on the source provider.
                        Bitbucket

                     This  parameter is used for the url parameter in the Bit-
                     bucket commit status. For more information, see build  in
                     the Bitbucket API documentation.
                        GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server

                     This  parameter  is  used for the target_url parameter in
                     the GitHub  commit  status.  For  more  information,  see
                     Create a commit status in the GitHub developer guide.

              insecureSsl -> (boolean)

                 the project source code.

              sourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 An identifier for this project  source.  The  identifier  can
                 only  contain  alphanumeric  characters  and underscores, and
                 must be less than 128 characters in length.

          secondarySources -> (list)
              An array of ProjectSource objects that define  the  sources  for
              the batch build.

              (structure)
                 Information  about  the build input source code for the build
                 project.

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of repository that contains the source  code  to
                     be built. Valid values include:

                     o BITBUCKET  :  The source code is in a Bitbucket reposi-
                       tory.

                     o CODECOMMIT : The source code is in an CodeCommit repos-
                       itory.

                     o CODEPIPELINE  :  The source code settings are specified
                       in the source action of a pipeline in CodePipeline.

                     o GITHUB : The source code is in a GitHub repository.

                     o GITHUB_ENTERPRISE : The source code is in a GitHub  En-
                       terprise Server repository.

                     o GITLAB : The source code is in a GitLab repository.

                     o GITLAB_SELF_MANAGED : The source code is in a self-man-
                       aged GitLab repository.

                     o NO_SOURCE : The project  does  not  have  input  source
                       code.

                     o S3 : The source code is in an Amazon S3 bucket.

                 location -> (string)
                     Information  about  the location of the source code to be
                     built. Valid values include:

                     o For source code settings  that  are  specified  in  the
                       source  action  of a pipeline in CodePipeline, location
                       should not be specified.  If  it  is  specified,  Code-
                       Pipeline  ignores it. This is because CodePipeline uses
                       the settings in a pipeline's source action  instead  of
                       this value.

                     o For  source code in an CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS
                       clone URL to the repository that  contains  the  source
                       code    and    the   buildspec   file   (for   example,
                       https://git-codecommit.<region-ID>.amazonaws.com/v1/re-
                       pos/<repo-name> ).

                       the following.

                       o The path to the ZIP file  that  contains  the  source
                         code    (for    example,    <bucket-name>/<path>/<ob-
                         ject-name>.zip ).

                       o The path to the folder that contains the source  code
                         (for                                         example,
                         <bucket-name>/<path-to-source-code>/<folder>/ ).

                     o For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone
                       URL  to the repository that contains the source and the
                       buildspec file. You must connect your Amazon  Web  Ser-
                       vices account to your GitHub account. Use the CodeBuild
                       console to start creating a build project. When you use
                       the  console  to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on
                       the GitHub Authorize application page, for Organization
                       access  , choose Request access next to each repository
                       you want to allow CodeBuild to have access to, and then
                       choose  Authorize  application  .  (After you have con-
                       nected to your GitHub account, you do not need to  fin-
                       ish creating the build project. You can leave the Code-
                       Build console.) To instruct CodeBuild to use this  con-
                       nection,  in  the  source object, set the auth object's
                       type value to OAUTH .

                     o For source code in an  GitLab  or  self-managed  GitLab
                       repository,  the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that
                       contains the source and the buildspec  file.  You  must
                       connect your Amazon Web Services account to your GitLab
                       account. Use the CodeBuild console to start creating  a
                       build  project. When you use the console to connect (or
                       reconnect) with GitLab, on  the  Connections  Authorize
                       application  page,  choose  Authorize  .  Then  on  the
                       CodeStar Connections  Create  GitLab  connection  page,
                       choose Connect to GitLab . (After you have connected to
                       your GitLab account, you do not need to finish creating
                       the  build  project.  You  can leave the CodeBuild con-
                       sole.) To instruct CodeBuild to  override  the  default
                       connection  and  use  this  connection instead, set the
                       auth object's type  value  to  CODECONNECTIONS  in  the
                       source object.

                     o For  source  code  in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS
                       clone URL to the repository that  contains  the  source
                       and  the  buildspec  file. You must connect your Amazon
                       Web Services account to your Bitbucket account. Use the
                       CodeBuild  console  to  start creating a build project.
                       When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with
                       Bitbucket,  on the Bitbucket Confirm access to your ac-
                       count page, choose Grant access . (After you have  con-
                       nected  to  your  Bitbucket account, you do not need to
                       finish creating the build project. You  can  leave  the
                       CodeBuild  console.)  To instruct CodeBuild to use this
                       connection, in the source object, set the auth object's
                       type value to OAUTH .

                     If  you specify CODEPIPELINE for the Type property, don't
                     specify this property. For all of the  other  types,  you
                     must specify Location .

                 gitCloneDepth -> (integer)
                     Information  about  the  Git  clone  depth  for the build
                     project.

                 gitSubmodulesConfig -> (structure)
                     Information about the Git  submodules  configuration  for
                     the build project.

                     fetchSubmodules -> (boolean)
                        Set to true to fetch Git submodules for your CodeBuild
                        build project.

                 buildspec -> (string)
                     The buildspec file declaration to use for the  builds  in
                     this build project.

                     If  this  value is set, it can be either an inline build-
                     spec definition, the path to an alternate buildspec  file
                     relative  to  the value of the built-in CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR
                     environment variable, or the path to an  S3  bucket.  The
                     bucket  must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region as
                     the build project. Specify the buildspec file  using  its
                     ARN    (for    example,    arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sam-
                     ple2/buildspec.yml ). If this value is not provided or is
                     set  to  an  empty string, the source code must contain a
                     buildspec file in its root directory. For  more  informa-
                     tion, see Buildspec File Name and Storage Location .

                 auth -> (structure)
                     Information  about  the  authorization settings for Code-
                     Build to access the source code to be built.

                     This information is for the CodeBuild console's use only.
                     Your  code  should  not  get  or set this information di-
                     rectly.

                     type -> (string)
                        The authorization type to use. Valid options are OAUTH
                        or CODECONNECTIONS.

                     resource -> (string)
                        The  resource  value that applies to the specified au-
                        thorization type.

                 reportBuildStatus -> (boolean)
                     Set to true to report the status of a build's  start  and
                     finish to your source provider. This option is valid only
                     when your source provider is GitHub,  GitHub  Enterprise,
                     GitLab, GitLab Self Managed, or Bitbucket. If this is set
                     and you use a different source provider, an  invalidInpu-
                     tException is thrown.

                     To  be  able  to  report  the  build status to the source
                     provider, the user associated with  the  source  provider
                     must  have write access to the repo. If the user does not
                     have write access, the build status  cannot  be  updated.
                     For  more  information, see Source provider access in the
                     CodeBuild User Guide .

                     The status of a build triggered by a  webhook  is  always
                     reported to your source provider.

                     If  your project's builds are triggered by a webhook, you
                     must push a new commit to the repo for a change  to  this
                     property to take effect.

                 buildStatusConfig -> (structure)
                     Contains  information  that defines how the build project
                     reports the build status to the source provider. This op-
                     tion  is  only  used when the source provider is GITHUB ,
                     GITHUB_ENTERPRISE , or BITBUCKET .

                     context -> (string)
                        Specifies the context of the  build  status  CodeBuild
                        sends to the source provider. The usage of this param-
                        eter depends on the source provider.
                            Bitbucket

                        This parameter is used for the name parameter  in  the
                        Bitbucket  commit  status.  For  more information, see
                        build in the Bitbucket API documentation.
                            GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server

                        This parameter is used for the  context  parameter  in
                        the  GitHub  commit  status. For more information, see
                        Create a commit status in the GitHub developer guide.

                     targetUrl -> (string)
                        Specifies the target url of the build status CodeBuild
                        sends to the source provider. The usage of this param-
                        eter depends on the source provider.
                            Bitbucket

                        This parameter is used for the url  parameter  in  the
                        Bitbucket  commit  status.  For  more information, see
                        build in the Bitbucket API documentation.
                            GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server

                        This parameter is used for the target_url parameter in
                        the  GitHub  commit  status. For more information, see
                        Create a commit status in the GitHub developer guide.

                 insecureSsl -> (boolean)
                     Enable this flag to ignore SSL warnings while  connecting
                     to the project source code.

                 sourceIdentifier -> (string)
                     An identifier for this project source. The identifier can
                     only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores, and
                     must be less than 128 characters in length.

          secondarySourceVersions -> (list)

              o For GitHub: the commit ID, pull request ID,  branch  name,  or
                tag  name  that  corresponds to the version of the source code
                you want to build. If a pull request ID is specified, it  must
                use  the format pr/pull-request-ID (for example, pr/25 ). If a
                branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used.
                If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

              o For  Bitbucket:  the  commit ID, branch name, or tag name that
                corresponds to the version of the  source  code  you  want  to
                build. If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit
                ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit
                ID is used.

              o For  Amazon  S3:  the version ID of the object that represents
                the build input ZIP file to use.

              (structure)

                 sourceIdentifier -> (string)
                     An identifier for a source  in  the  build  project.  The
                     identifier  can  only contain alphanumeric characters and
                     underscores, and must be  less  than  128  characters  in
                     length.

                 sourceVersion -> (string)
                     The  source  version for the corresponding source identi-
                     fier. If specified, must be one of:

                     o For CodeCommit: the commit ID, branch, or  Git  tag  to
                       use.

                     o For  GitHub  or GitLab: the commit ID, pull request ID,
                       branch name, or tag name that corresponds to  the  ver-
                       sion  of  the  source code you want to build. If a pull
                       request  ID  is  specified,  it  must  use  the  format
                       pr/pull-request-ID  (for  example, pr/25 ). If a branch
                       name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used.
                       If  not  specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID
                       is used.

                     o For Bitbucket: the commit ID, branch name, or tag  name
                       that  corresponds to the version of the source code you
                       want to build. If  a  branch  name  is  specified,  the
                       branch's  HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the
                       default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

                     o For Amazon S3: the version ID of the object that repre-
                       sents the build input ZIP file to use.

                     For  more  information,  see  Source  Version Sample with
                     CodeBuild in the CodeBuild User Guide .

          artifacts -> (structure)
              A BuildArtifacts object the defines the build artifacts for this
              batch build.

              location -> (string)
                 Information about the location of the build artifacts.

              sha256sum -> (string)
                 The SHA-256 hash of the build artifact.

                 You  can  use this hash along with a checksum tool to confirm
                 file integrity and authenticity.

                 NOTE:
                     This value is available only if the build project's pack-
                     aging value is set to ZIP .

              md5sum -> (string)
                 The MD5 hash of the build artifact.

                 You  can  use this hash along with a checksum tool to confirm
                 file integrity and authenticity.

                 NOTE:
                     This value is available only if the build project's pack-
                     aging value is set to ZIP .

              overrideArtifactName -> (boolean)
                 If  this  flag is set, a name specified in the buildspec file
                 overrides the artifact name. The name specified in  a  build-
                 spec file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Com-
                 mand Language. For example, you can append a date and time to
                 your artifact name so that it is always unique.

              encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                 Information  that tells you if encryption for build artifacts
                 is disabled.

              artifactIdentifier -> (string)
                 An identifier for this artifact definition.

              bucketOwnerAccess -> (string)
                 Specifies the bucket owner's access for objects that  another
                 account  uploads  to their Amazon S3 bucket. By default, only
                 the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access
                 to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket
                 owner access to these objects.

                 NOTE:
                     To use this property, your CodeBuild  service  role  must
                     have  the s3:PutBucketAcl permission. This permission al-
                     lows CodeBuild to modify the access control list for  the
                     bucket.

                 This property can be one of the following values:
                     NONE

                 The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is
                 the default.
                     READ_ONLY

                 The bucket owner has read-only access to the objects. The up-
                 loading account retains ownership of the objects.
                     FULL

                 The  bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object own-
                 ership is determined by the following criteria:

                 o If the bucket is configured with the Bucket owner preferred
                   setting,  the  bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading
                   account  will  have  object  access  as  specified  by  the
                   bucket's policy.

                 o Otherwise,  the  uploading account retains ownership of the
                   objects.

                 For more information about Amazon S3  object  ownership,  see
                 Controlling  ownership  of  uploaded  objects using S3 Object
                 Ownership in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide .

          secondaryArtifacts -> (list)
              An array of BuildArtifacts objects the define  the  build  arti-
              facts for this batch build.

              (structure)
                 Information about build output artifacts.

                 location -> (string)
                     Information about the location of the build artifacts.

                 sha256sum -> (string)
                     The SHA-256 hash of the build artifact.

                     You  can use this hash along with a checksum tool to con-
                     firm file integrity and authenticity.

                     NOTE:
                        This value is available only if  the  build  project's
                        packaging value is set to ZIP .

                 md5sum -> (string)
                     The MD5 hash of the build artifact.

                     You  can use this hash along with a checksum tool to con-
                     firm file integrity and authenticity.

                     NOTE:
                        This value is available only if  the  build  project's
                        packaging value is set to ZIP .

                 overrideArtifactName -> (boolean)
                     If  this  flag  is set, a name specified in the buildspec
                     file overrides the artifact name. The name specified in a
                     buildspec  file  is calculated at build time and uses the
                     Shell Command Language. For example,  you  can  append  a
                     date  and time to your artifact name so that it is always
                     unique.

                 encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                     Information that tells you if encryption for build  arti-
                     facts is disabled.

                 artifactIdentifier -> (string)
                     An identifier for this artifact definition.

                 bucketOwnerAccess -> (string)
                     Specifies  the bucket owner's access for objects that an-
                     other account uploads to their Amazon S3 bucket.  By  de-
                     fault,  only  the account that uploads the objects to the
                     bucket has access to these objects. This property  allows
                     you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

                     NOTE:
                        To use this property, your CodeBuild service role must
                        have the s3:PutBucketAcl permission.  This  permission
                        allows CodeBuild to modify the access control list for
                        the bucket.

                     This property can be one of the following values:
                        NONE

                     The bucket owner does not have  access  to  the  objects.
                     This is the default.
                        READ_ONLY

                     The bucket owner has read-only access to the objects. The
                     uploading account retains ownership of the objects.
                        FULL

                     The bucket owner has full access to the  objects.  Object
                     ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                     o If  the bucket is configured with the Bucket owner pre-
                       ferred setting, the bucket owner owns the objects.  The
                       uploading  account will have object access as specified
                       by the bucket's policy.

                     o Otherwise, the uploading account retains  ownership  of
                       the objects.

          cache -> (structure)
              Information about the cache for the build project.

              type -> (string)
                 The type of cache used by the build project. Valid values in-
                 clude:

                 o NO_CACHE : The build project does not use any cache.

                 o S3 : The build project reads and writes from and to S3.

                 o LOCAL : The build project stores a cache locally on a build
                   host that is only available to that build host.

              location -> (string)
                 Information about the cache location:

                 o NO_CACHE or LOCAL : This value is ignored.

                 o S3 : This is the S3 bucket name/prefix.

              modes -> (list)
                 An array of strings that specify the local cache  modes.  You
                 can  use one or more local cache modes at the same time. This
                 is only used for LOCAL cache types.

                 Possible values are:
                     LOCAL_SOURCE_CACHE

                 Caches Git metadata for primary and secondary sources.  After
                 the  cache is created, subsequent builds pull only the change
                 between commits. This mode is a good choice for projects with
                 a  clean  working  directory and a source that is a large Git
                 repository. If you choose this option and your  project  does
                 not  use a Git repository (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bit-
                 bucket), the option is ignored.
                     LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE

                 Caches existing Docker layers. This mode is a good choice for
                 projects  that build or pull large Docker images. It can pre-
                 vent the performance issues caused by  pulling  large  Docker
                 images down from the network.

                 NOTE:

                     o You  can use a Docker layer cache in the Linux environ-
                       ment only.

                     o The privileged flag must be set so  that  your  project
                       has the required Docker permissions.

                     o You  should  consider  the security implications before
                       you use a Docker layer cache.

                     LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE

                 Caches directories you specify in the  buildspec  file.  This
                 mode is a good choice if your build scenario is not suited to
                 one of the other three local cache modes. If you use a custom
                 cache:

                 o Only  directories  can be specified for caching. You cannot
                   specify individual files.

                 o Symlinks are used to reference cached directories.

                 o Cached directories are linked to your build before it down-
                   loads its project sources. Cached items are overridden if a
                   source item has the same name.  Directories  are  specified
                   using cache paths in the buildspec file.

                 NOTE:
                     If you're using compute fleets during  project  creation,
                     type will be ignored.

              image -> (string)
                 The image tag or image digest that identifies the Docker  im-
                 age to use for this build project. Use the following formats:

                 o For an image tag: <registry>/<repository>:<tag> . For exam-
                   ple, in the Docker repository that CodeBuild uses to manage
                   its Docker images, this would be aws/codebuild/standard:4.0
                   .

                 o For an image digest: <registry>/<repository>@<digest> . For

                 For more information, see Build Environment Compute Types  in
                 the CodeBuild User Guide.

              fleet -> (structure)
                 A ProjectFleet object to use for this build project.

                 fleetArn -> (string)

              environmentVariables -> (list)
                 A  set  of  environment variables to make available to builds
                 for this build project.

                 (structure)
                     Information about an environment  variable  for  a  build
                     project or a build.

                     name -> (string)
                        The name or key of the environment variable.

                     value -> (string)
                        The value of the environment variable.

                        WARNING:
                            We  strongly discourage the use of PLAINTEXT envi-
                            ronment variables to store sensitive values, espe-
                            cially  Amazon Web Services secret key IDs. PLAIN-
                            TEXT environment variables  can  be  displayed  in
                            plain  text  using  the  CodeBuild console and the
                            CLI. For sensitive values, we recommend you use an
                            environment  variable  of  type PARAMETER_STORE or
                            SECRETS_MANAGER .

                     type -> (string)
                        The type of environment  variable.  Valid  values  in-
                        clude:

                        o PARAMETER_STORE  : An environment variable stored in
                          Systems Manager  Parameter  Store.  For  environment
                          variables  of this type, specify the name of the pa-
                          rameter as the value of the EnvironmentVariable. The
                          parameter  value will be substituted for the name at
                          runtime. You can also define Parameter  Store  envi-
                          ronment  variables in the buildspec. To learn how to
                          do so, see env/parameter-store in the CodeBuild User
                          Guide .

                        o PLAINTEXT  :  An  environment variable in plain text
                          format. This is the default value.

                        o SECRETS_MANAGER : An environment variable stored  in
                          Secrets  Manager.  For environment variables of this
                          type, specify the name of the secret as the value of
                          the  EnvironmentVariable.  The  secret value will be
                          substituted for the name at runtime.  You  can  also
                          define  Secrets Manager environment variables in the
                          buildspec.   To   learn   how   to   do   so,    see
                          env/secrets-manager in the CodeBuild User Guide .

              privilegedMode -> (boolean)
                 Enables  running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container.
                 Set to true only if the build project is used to build Docker
                 images. Otherwise, a build that attempts to interact with the
                 Docker daemon fails. The default setting is false .

                 You can initialize the Docker daemon during the install phase
                 of your build by adding one of the following sets of commands
                 to the install phase of your buildspec file:

                 If the operating system's base image is Ubuntu Linux:
                     -              nohup               /usr/local/bin/dockerd
                     --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock
                     --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&

                     - timeout 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo  .;  sleep
                     1; done"

                 If  the operating system's base image is Alpine Linux and the
                 previous command does not work, add the -t argument to  time-
                 out :
                     -               nohup              /usr/local/bin/dockerd
                     --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock
                     --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&

                     -  timeout  -t  15  sh  -c "until docker info; do echo .;
                     sleep 1; done"

              certificate -> (string)
                 The ARN of the Amazon S3 bucket, path prefix, and object  key
                 that  contains  the  PEM-encoded  certificate  for  the build
                 project. For more information, see certificate in  the  Code-
                 Build User Guide .

              registryCredential -> (structure)
                 The credentials for access to a private registry.

                 credential -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) or name of credentials
                     created using Secrets Manager.

                     NOTE:
                        The credential can use the  name  of  the  credentials
                        only if they exist in your current Amazon Web Services
                        Region.

                 credentialProvider -> (string)
                     The service that created the credentials to access a pri-
                     vate  Docker  registry. The valid value, SECRETS_MANAGER,
                     is for Secrets Manager.

              imagePullCredentialsType -> (string)
                 The type of credentials CodeBuild uses to pull images in your
                 build. There are two valid values:

                 o CODEBUILD  specifies  that  CodeBuild  uses its own creden-
                   tials. This requires that you modify  your  ECR  repository
                   policy to trust CodeBuild service principal.

                 o SERVICE_ROLE  specifies  that  CodeBuild  uses  your  build
                   project's service role.

                 When you use a cross-account or private registry  image,  you
                 must  use SERVICE_ROLE credentials. When you use an CodeBuild
                 curated image, you must use CODEBUILD credentials.

          serviceRole -> (string)
              The name of a service role used for builds in the batch.

          logConfig -> (structure)
              Information about logs for a build project. These can be logs in
              CloudWatch Logs, built in a specified S3 bucket, or both.

              cloudWatchLogs -> (structure)
                 Information about CloudWatch Logs for a build project. Cloud-

                     The current status of the logs in CloudWatch Logs  for  a
                     build project. Valid values are:

                     o ENABLED  :  CloudWatch  Logs are enabled for this build
                       project.

                     o DISABLED : CloudWatch Logs are  not  enabled  for  this
                       build project.

                 groupName -> (string)
                     The  group  name of the logs in CloudWatch Logs. For more
                     information, see Working with Log Groups and Log  Streams
                     .

                 streamName -> (string)
                     The prefix of the stream name of the CloudWatch Logs. For
                     more information, see Working with  Log  Groups  and  Log
                     Streams .

              s3Logs -> (structure)
                 Information  about  logs  built  to  an S3 bucket for a build
                 project. S3 logs are not enabled by default.

                 status -> (string)
                     The current status of the S3  build  logs.  Valid  values
                     are:

                     o ENABLED  :  S3  build  logs  are enabled for this build
                       project.

                     o DISABLED : S3 build logs are not enabled for this build
                       project.

                 location -> (string)
                     The  ARN of an S3 bucket and the path prefix for S3 logs.
                     If your Amazon S3 bucket name is  my-bucket  ,  and  your
                     path  prefix  is  build-log , then acceptable formats are
                     my-bucket/build-log or arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/build-log .

                 encryptionDisabled -> (boolean)
                     Set to true if you do not want your S3 build  log  output
                     encrypted. By default S3 build logs are encrypted.

                 bucketOwnerAccess -> (string)
                     Specifies  the bucket owner's access for objects that an-
                     other account uploads to their Amazon S3 bucket.  By  de-
                     fault,  only  the account that uploads the objects to the
                     bucket has access to these objects. This property  allows
                     you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.

                     NOTE:
                        To use this property, your CodeBuild service role must
                        have the s3:PutBucketAcl permission.  This  permission
                        allows CodeBuild to modify the access control list for
                        the bucket.

                     This property can be one of the following values:
                        NONE

                     The bucket owner does not have  access  to  the  objects.
                     This is the default.
                        READ_ONLY

                     The bucket owner has read-only access to the objects. The
                     uploading account retains ownership of the objects.
                        FULL

                     The bucket owner has full access to the  objects.  Object
                     ownership is determined by the following criteria:

                     o If  the bucket is configured with the Bucket owner pre-
                       ferred setting, the bucket owner owns the objects.  The
                       uploading  account will have object access as specified
                       by the bucket's policy.

                     o Otherwise, the uploading account retains  ownership  of
                       the objects.

                     For  more  information  about Amazon S3 object ownership,
                     see Controlling ownership of uploaded  objects  using  S3
                     Object  Ownership  in  the  Amazon Simple Storage Service
                     User Guide .

          buildTimeoutInMinutes -> (integer)
              Specifies the maximum amount of time, in minutes, that the build
              in a batch must be completed in.

          queuedTimeoutInMinutes -> (integer)
              Specifies  the  amount of time, in minutes, that the batch build
              is allowed to be queued before it times out.

          complete -> (boolean)
              Indicates if the batch build is complete.

          initiator -> (string)
              The entity that started the batch build. Valid values include:

              o If CodePipeline started the build, the  pipeline's  name  (for
                example, codepipeline/my-demo-pipeline ).

              o If a user started the build, the user's name.

              o If  the  Jenkins  plugin  for CodeBuild started the build, the
                string CodeBuild-Jenkins-Plugin .

          vpcConfig -> (structure)
              Information about the VPC configuration that CodeBuild accesses.

                 (string)

          encryptionKey -> (string)
              The Key Management Service customer master key (CMK) to be  used
              for encrypting the batch build output artifacts.

              NOTE:
                 You can use a cross-account KMS key to encrypt the build out-
                 put artifacts if your service role  has  permission  to  that
                 key.

              You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK
              or,  if  available,  the   CMK's   alias   (using   the   format
              alias/<alias-name> ).

          buildBatchNumber -> (long)
              The number of the batch build. For each project, the buildBatch-
              Number of its first batch build is 1 . The  buildBatchNumber  of
              each  subsequent  batch  build  is incremented by 1 . If a batch
              build is deleted, the buildBatchNumber  of  other  batch  builds
              does not change.

          fileSystemLocations -> (list)
              An  array  of  ProjectFileSystemLocation  objects  for the batch
              build project. A ProjectFileSystemLocation object specifies  the
              identifier  , location , mountOptions , mountPoint , and type of
              a file system created using Amazon Elastic File System.

              (structure)
                 Information about a file system  created  by  Amazon  Elastic
                 File  System  (EFS). For more information, see What Is Amazon
                 Elastic File System?

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of the file system. The one  supported  type  is
                     EFS .

                 location -> (string)
                     A  string  that specifies the location of the file system
                     created by Amazon EFS. Its format is efs-dns-name:/direc-
                     tory-path . You can find the DNS name of file system when
                     you view it in the Amazon EFS console. The directory path
                     is  a  path  to a directory in the file system that Code-
                     Build mounts. For example, if the DNS name of a file sys-
                     tem  is fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com , and its
                     mount directory is my-efs-mount-directory , then the  lo-
                     cation        is        fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazon-
                     aws.com:/my-efs-mount-directory .

                     The directory path  in  the  format  efs-dns-name:/direc-
                     tory-path  is optional. If you do not specify a directory
                     path, the location is only the  DNS  name  and  CodeBuild
                     mounts the entire file system.

                 mountPoint -> (string)
                     The  location  in  the container where you mount the file
                     system.

                 identifier -> (string)
                     The name used to access a file system created  by  Amazon
                     EFS. CodeBuild creates an environment variable by append-
                     ing the identifier in all capital letters to CODEBUILD_ .
                     For example, if you specify my_efs for identifier , a new
                     environment variable is create named CODEBUILD_MY_EFS .

                     The identifier is used to mount your file system.

                 mountOptions -> (string)
                     The mount options for a file  system  created  by  Amazon
                     EFS.  The  default  mount  options  used by CodeBuild are
                     nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,re-
                     trans=2 . For more information, see Recommended NFS Mount
                     Options .

                     Specifies the maximum number of builds allowed.

                 computeTypesAllowed -> (list)
                     An array of strings that specify the compute  types  that
                     are  allowed  for  the batch build. See Build environment
                     compute types in the CodeBuild User Guide for these  val-
                     ues.

                 Contains information about a batch build build  group.  Build
                 groups  are  used to combine builds that can run in parallel,
                 while still being able to set  dependencies  on  other  build
                 groups.

                 identifier -> (string)
                     Contains the identifier of the build group.
