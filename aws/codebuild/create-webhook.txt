CREATE-WEBHOOK()                                              CREATE-WEBHOOK()



NAME
       create-webhook -

DESCRIPTION
       For an existing CodeBuild build project that has its source code stored
       in a GitHub or Bitbucket repository, enables  CodeBuild  to  start  re-
       building  the  source  code  every  time a code change is pushed to the
       repository.

       WARNING:
          If you enable webhooks for an CodeBuild project, and the project  is
          used  as a build step in CodePipeline, then two identical builds are
          created for each commit. One build is  triggered  through  webhooks,
          and  one through CodePipeline. Because billing is on a per-build ba-
          sis, you are billed for both builds. Therefore,  if  you  are  using
          CodePipeline,  we  recommend that you disable webhooks in CodeBuild.
          In the CodeBuild console, clear the Webhook box. For  more  informa-
          tion, see step 5 in Change a Build Project's Settings .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-webhook
          --project-name <value>
          [--branch-filter <value>]
          [--filter-groups <value>]
          [--build-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project-name (string)
          The name of the CodeBuild project.

       --branch-filter (string)
          A regular expression used to determine which repository branches are
          built when a webhook is triggered. If the name of a  branch  matches
          the  regular expression, then it is built. If branchFilter is empty,
          then all branches are built.

          NOTE:
              It is recommended that you use filterGroups instead  of  branch-
              Filter .

       --filter-groups (list)
          An  array of arrays of WebhookFilter objects used to determine which
          webhooks are triggered. At least one WebhookFilter in the array must
          specify EVENT as its type .

          For  a  build to be triggered, at least one filter group in the fil-
          terGroups array must pass. For a filter group to pass, each  of  its
          filters must pass.

          (list)
              (structure)
                 A filter used to determine which webhooks trigger a build.

                 type -> (string)
                     The  type of webhook filter. There are six webhook filter
                     types: EVENT , ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID , HEAD_REF ,  BASE_REF  ,
                     FILE_PATH , and COMMIT_MESSAGE .
                        EVENT

                     A  webhook  event triggers a build when the provided pat-
                     tern matches one of five event  types:  PUSH  ,  PULL_RE-
                     QUEST_CREATED  ,  PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED , PULL_REQUEST_RE-
                     OPENED , and PULL_REQUEST_MERGED . The EVENT patterns are
                     specified as a comma-separated string. For example, PUSH,
                     PULL_REQUEST_CREATED,  PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED  filters  all
                     push,  pull  request  created,  and  pull request updated
                     events.

                     NOTE:
                        The PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED works with GitHub and GitHub
                        Enterprise only.

                        ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID

                     A  webhook  event  triggers a build when a GitHub, GitHub
                     Enterprise, or Bitbucket account ID matches  the  regular
                     expression pattern .
                        HEAD_REF

                     A  webhook event triggers a build when the head reference
                     matches the regular expression  pattern  .  For  example,
                     refs/heads/branch-name and refs/tags/tag-name .

                     Works  with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise push, GitHub and
                     GitHub Enterprise pull request, Bitbucket push, and  Bit-
                     bucket pull request events.
                        BASE_REF

                     A  webhook event triggers a build when the base reference
                     matches the regular expression  pattern  .  For  example,
                     refs/heads/branch-name .

                     NOTE:
                        Works with pull request events only.

                        FILE_PATH

                     A  webhook  triggers  a  build when the path of a changed
                     file matches the regular expression pattern .

                     NOTE:
                        Works with GitHub and Bitbucket events push  and  pull
                        requests  events.  Also  works  with GitHub Enterprise
                        push events, but does not work with GitHub  Enterprise
                        pull request events.

                        COMMIT_MESSAGE

                     A  webhook  triggers a build when the head commit message
                     matches the regular expression pattern .

                     NOTE:
                        Works with GitHub and Bitbucket events push  and  pull
                        requests  events.  Also  works  with GitHub Enterprise
                        push events, but does not work with GitHub  Enterprise
                        pull request events.

                 pattern -> (string)
                     For  a  WebHookFilter that uses EVENT type, a comma-sepa-
                     rated string that specifies one or more events. For exam-
                     ple,   the  webhook  filter  PUSH,  PULL_REQUEST_CREATED,
                     PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED allows all push, pull  request  cre-
                     ated, and pull request updated events to trigger a build.

                     For  a  WebHookFilter  that  uses any of the other filter
                     types, a regular expression pattern. For example, a  Web-
                     HookFilter  that  uses HEAD_REF for its type and the pat-
                     tern ^refs/heads/ triggers a build when the  head  refer-
                     ence    is    a    branch    with    a   reference   name
                     refs/heads/branch-name .

                 excludeMatchedPattern -> (boolean)
                     Used to indicate that the pattern determines  which  web-
                     hook  events do not trigger a build. If true, then a web-
                     hook event that does not match  the  pattern  triggers  a
                     build.  If  false,  then a webhook event that matches the
                     pattern triggers a build.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          [{type=string,pattern=string,excludeMatchedPattern=boolean},{type=string,pattern=string,excludeMatchedPattern=boolean}] ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            [
              {
                "type": "EVENT"|"BASE_REF"|"HEAD_REF"|"ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID"|"FILE_PATH"|"COMMIT_MESSAGE",
                "pattern": "string",
                "excludeMatchedPattern": true|false
              }
              ...
            ]
            ...
          ]

       --build-type (string)
          Specifies the type of build this webhook will trigger.

          Possible values:

          o BUILD

          o BUILD_BATCH

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create webhook filters for an AWS CodeBuild project

       The following create-webhook example creates a webhook for a  CodeBuild
       project  named  my-project that has two filter groups. The first filter
       group specifies pull requests that are created, updated, or reopened on
       branches  with  Git  reference  names that match the regular expression
       ^refs/heads/master$ and  head  references  that  match  ^refs/heads/my-
       Branch$.   The  second filter group specifies push requests on branches
       with Git reference names that  do  not  match  the  regular  expression
       ^refs/heads/myBranch$.

          aws codebuild create-webhook \
              --project-name my-project \
              --filter-groups "[[{\"type\":\"EVENT\",\"pattern\":\"PULL_REQUEST_CREATED, PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED, PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED\"},{\"type\":\"HEAD_REF\",\"pattern\":\"^refs/heads/myBranch$\",\"excludeMatchedPattern\":true},{\"type\":\"BASE_REF\",\"pattern\":\"^refs/heads/master$\",\"excludeMatchedPattern\":true}],[{\"type\":\"EVENT\",\"pattern\":\"PUSH\"},{\"type\":\"HEAD_REF\",\"pattern\":\"^refs/heads/myBranch$\",\"excludeMatchedPattern\":true}]]"

OUTPUT
       webhook -> (structure)
          Information about a webhook that connects  repository  events  to  a
          build project in CodeBuild.

          url -> (string)
              The URL to the webhook.

          payloadUrl -> (string)
              The CodeBuild endpoint where webhook events are sent.

          secret -> (string)
              The secret token of the associated repository.

              NOTE:
                 A Bitbucket webhook does not support secret .

          branchFilter -> (string)
              A regular expression used to determine which repository branches
              are built when a webhook is triggered. If the name of  a  branch
              matches  the regular expression, then it is built. If branchFil-
              ter is empty, then all branches are built.

              NOTE:
                 It is  recommended  that  you  use  filterGroups  instead  of
                 branchFilter .

          filterGroups -> (list)
              An  array  of  arrays of WebhookFilter objects used to determine
              which webhooks are triggered. At least one WebhookFilter in  the
              array must specify EVENT as its type .

              For  a  build  to be triggered, at least one filter group in the
              filterGroups array must pass. For a filter group to  pass,  each
              of its filters must pass.

              (list)
                 (structure)
                     A  filter  used  to  determine  which  webhooks trigger a
                     build.

                     type -> (string)
                        The type of webhook filter. There are six webhook fil-
                        ter  types:  EVENT  ,  ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID  ,  HEAD_REF ,
                        BASE_REF , FILE_PATH , and COMMIT_MESSAGE .
                            EVENT

                        A webhook event triggers a  build  when  the  provided
                        pattern  matches  one  of  five  event  types:  PUSH ,
                        PULL_REQUEST_CREATED , PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED , PULL_RE-
                        QUEST_REOPENED  ,  and PULL_REQUEST_MERGED . The EVENT
                        patterns are specified as  a  comma-separated  string.
                        For   example,  PUSH,  PULL_REQUEST_CREATED,  PULL_RE-
                        QUEST_UPDATED filters all push, pull request  created,
                        and pull request updated events.

                        NOTE:
                            The  PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED  works  with GitHub and
                            GitHub Enterprise only.

                            ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID

                        A webhook event triggers a build when a GitHub, GitHub
                        Enterprise,  or Bitbucket account ID matches the regu-
                        lar expression pattern .
                            HEAD_REF

                        A webhook event triggers a build when the head  refer-
                        ence  matches the regular expression pattern . For ex-
                        ample, refs/heads/branch-name and refs/tags/tag-name .

                        Works with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise  push,  GitHub
                        and  GitHub  Enterprise  pull request, Bitbucket push,
                        and Bitbucket pull request events.
                            BASE_REF

                        A webhook event triggers a build when the base  refer-
                        ence  matches the regular expression pattern . For ex-
                        ample, refs/heads/branch-name .

                        NOTE:
                            Works with pull request events only.

                            FILE_PATH

                        A webhook triggers a build when the path of a  changed
                        file matches the regular expression pattern .

                        NOTE:
                            Works  with  GitHub  and Bitbucket events push and
                            pull requests events. Also works with  GitHub  En-
                            terprise  push  events,  but  does  not  work with
                            GitHub Enterprise pull request events.

                            COMMIT_MESSAGE

                        A webhook triggers a build when the head  commit  mes-
                        sage matches the regular expression pattern .

                        NOTE:
                            Works  with  GitHub  and Bitbucket events push and
                            pull requests events. Also works with  GitHub  En-
                            terprise  push  events,  but  does  not  work with
                            GitHub Enterprise pull request events.

                     pattern -> (string)
                        For a WebHookFilter that uses EVENT type, a comma-sep-
                        arated  string  that specifies one or more events. For
                        example, the webhook  filter  PUSH,  PULL_REQUEST_CRE-
                        ATED,  PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED  allows all push, pull re-
                        quest created, and  pull  request  updated  events  to
                        trigger a build.

                        For  a WebHookFilter that uses any of the other filter
                        types, a regular expression pattern.  For  example,  a
                        WebHookFilter  that uses HEAD_REF for its type and the
                        pattern ^refs/heads/ triggers a build  when  the  head
                        reference   is   a   branch   with  a  reference  name
                        refs/heads/branch-name .

                     excludeMatchedPattern -> (boolean)
                        Used to indicate that  the  pattern  determines  which
                        webhook events do not trigger a build. If true, then a
                        webhook event that does not match the pattern triggers
                        a  build.  If false, then a webhook event that matches
                        the pattern triggers a build.

          buildType -> (string)
              Specifies the type of build this webhook will trigger.

          lastModifiedSecret -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp that indicates the last time a  repository's  secret
              token was modified.
