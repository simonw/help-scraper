DESCRIPTION
       Analyzes  and accumulates test report values for the specified test re-
       ports.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-report-group-trend
          --report-group-arn <value>
          [--num-of-reports <value>]
          --trend-field <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --report-group-arn (string)
          The ARN of the report group that contains the reports to analyze.

       --num-of-reports (integer)
          The number of reports to analyze. This  operation  always  retrieves
          the most recent reports.

          If  this  parameter is omitted, the most recent 100 reports are ana-
          lyzed.

       --trend-field (string)
          The test report value to accumulate. This must be one of the follow-
          ing values:
              Test reports:   DURATION

          Accumulate the test run times for the specified reports.
              PASS_RATE

          Accumulate  the  percentage  of  tests that passed for the specified
          test reports.
              TOTAL

          Accumulate the total number of tests for the specified test reports.
              Code coverage reports:   BRANCH_COVERAGE

          Accumulate the branch coverage percentages for  the  specified  test
          reports.
              BRANCHES_COVERED

          Accumulate  the  branches  covered values for the specified test re-
          ports.
              BRANCHES_MISSED

          Accumulate the branches missed values for  the  specified  test  re-
          ports.
              LINE_COVERAGE

          Accumulate  the line coverage percentages for the specified test re-
          ports.
              LINES_COVERED

          Accumulate the lines covered values for the specified test reports.
              LINES_MISSED

          Accumulate the lines not covered values for the specified  test  re-
          ports.

          Possible values:

          o PASS_RATE

          o DURATION

          o TOTAL

          o LINE_COVERAGE

          o LINES_COVERED

          o LINES_MISSED

          o BRANCH_COVERAGE

          o BRANCHES_COVERED

          o BRANCHES_MISSED

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
