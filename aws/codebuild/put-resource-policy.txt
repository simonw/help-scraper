SYNOPSIS
            put-resource-policy
          --policy <value>
          --resource-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy (string)
          A JSON-formatted resource policy. For more information, see  Sharing
          a Project and Sharing a Report Group in the CodeBuild User Guide .

       --resource-arn (string)
          The ARN of the Project or ReportGroup resource you want to associate
          with a resource policy.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       resourceArn -> (string)
          The  ARN  of  the Project or ReportGroup resource that is associated
          with a resource policy.
