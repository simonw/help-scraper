NAME
       update-channel-flow -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates channel flow attributes. This is a developer API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-channel-flow
          --channel-flow-arn <value>
          --processors <value>
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-flow-arn (string)
          The ARN of the channel flow.

       --processors (list)
          Information about the processor Lambda functions

          (structure)
              The information about a processor in a channel flow.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the channel flow.

              Configuration -> (structure)
                 The  information  about the type of processor and its identi-
                 fier.

                 Lambda -> (structure)
                     Indicates that the processor is of type Lambda.

                     ResourceArn -> (string)
                        The ARN of the Lambda message processing function.

                     InvocationType -> (string)
                        Controls how the Lambda function is invoked.

              ExecutionOrder -> (integer)
                 The sequence in which processors run. If  you  have  multiple
                 processors in a channel flow, message processing goes through
                 each processor in the sequence. The value determines the  se-
                 quence.  At  this point, we support only 1 processor within a
                 flow.

              FallbackAction -> (string)
                 Determines whether to continue  with  message  processing  or
                 stop  it in cases where communication with a processor fails.
                 If a processor has a fallback action of ABORT and  communica-
                 tion  with it fails, the processor sets the message status to
                 FAILED and does not send the message to any recipients.  Note
                 that if the last processor in the channel flow sequence has a
                 fallback action of CONTINUE and communication with  the  pro-
                 cessor  fails,  then  the message is considered processed and
                 sent to recipients of the channel.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Configuration={Lambda={ResourceArn=string,InvocationType=string}},ExecutionOrder=integer,FallbackAction=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Configuration": {
                "Lambda": {
                  "ResourceArn": "string",
                  "InvocationType": "ASYNC"
                }
              },
              "ExecutionOrder": integer,
              "FallbackAction": "CONTINUE"|"ABORT"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --name (string)
          The name of the channel flow.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ChannelFlowArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the channel flow.
