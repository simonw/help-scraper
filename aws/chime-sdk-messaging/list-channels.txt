NAME

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  Channels  created  under  a single Chime App as a paginated
       list. You can specify filters to narrow results.
          Functionality & restrictions

       o Use privacy = PUBLIC to retrieve all public channels in the account.

       o Only an AppInstanceAdmin can set privacy = PRIVATE to list  the  pri-
         vate channels in an account.

       NOTE:
          The  x-amz-chime-bearer  request header is mandatory. Use the AppIn-
          stanceUserArn of the user that makes the API call as  the  value  in
          the header.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-channels
          --app-instance-arn <value>
          [--privacy <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          --chime-bearer <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --app-instance-arn (string)
          The ARN of the AppInstance .

       --privacy (string)
          The  privacy setting. PUBLIC retrieves all the public channels. PRI-
          VATE retrieves private channels. Only an  AppInstanceAdmin  can  re-
          trieve private channels.

          Possible values:

          o PUBLIC

          o PRIVATE

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of channels that you want to return.

       --next-token (string)
          The  token passed by previous API calls until all requested channels
          are returned.

       --chime-bearer (string)
          The AppInstanceUserArn of the user that makes the API call.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
