DESCRIBE-ORGANIZATION()                                DESCRIBE-ORGANIZATION()



NAME
       describe-organization -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about  the organization that the user's account
       belongs to.

       This operation can be called from any account in the organization.

       NOTE:
          Even if a policy type is shown as available in the organization, you
          can  disable it separately at the root level with  DisablePolicyType
          . Use  ListRoots to see the status of policy types for  a  specified
          root.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-organization
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              WARNING:
                 Do not use. This field is deprecated and doesn't provide com-
                 plete information about the policies in your organization.

              To determine the policies that are enabled and available for use
              in your organization, use the  ListRoots operation instead.

              (structure)
                 Contains  information  about  a policy type and its status in
                 the associated root.

                 Type -> (string)

                     ciated  root. To attach a policy of the specified type to
                     a root or to an OU or account in that root,  it  must  be
                     available in the organization and enabled for that root.
