ENABLE-ALL-FEATURES()                                    ENABLE-ALL-FEATURES()



NAME
       enable-all-features -

DESCRIPTION
       Enables  all features in an organization. This enables the use of orga-
       nization policies that can restrict the services and actions  that  can
       be  called in each account. Until you enable all features, you have ac-
       cess only to consolidated billing, and you can't use  any  of  the  ad-
       vanced account administration features that AWS Organizations supports.
       For more information, see Enabling All Features in Your Organization in
       the AWS Organizations User Guide.

       WARNING:
          This  operation is required only for organizations that were created
          explicitly with only  the  consolidated  billing  features  enabled.
          Calling this operation sends a handshake to every invited account in
          the organization. The feature set change can be  finalized  and  the
          additional features enabled only after all administrators in the in-
          vited accounts approve the change by accepting the handshake.

       After you enable all features, you can separately enable or disable in-
       dividual  policy  types in a root using  EnablePolicyType and  Disable-
       PolicyType . To see the status of policy types in a  root,  use   List-
       Roots .

       After  all  invited  member accounts accept the handshake, you finalize
       the feature set change by accepting the handshake  that  contains  "Ac-
       tion": "ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES" . This completes the change.

       After  you enable all features in your organization, the management ac-
       count in the organization can apply policies on  all  member  accounts.
       These policies can restrict what users and even administrators in those
       accounts can do. The management account can apply policies that prevent
       accounts from leaving the organization. Ensure that your account admin-
       istrators are aware of this.

       This operation can be called only from  the  organization's  management
       account.

SYNOPSIS
            enable-all-features
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To enable all features in an organization

       This example shows the administrator asking all the invited accounts in
       the  organization  to approve enabled all features in the organization.
       AWS Organizations sends an email to the address that is registered with
       every  invited member account asking the owner to approve the change to
       all features by accepting the handshake that is sent. After all invited
       member  accounts  accept  the handshake, the organization administrator
       can finalize the change to all features,  and  those  with  appropriate
       permissions  can  create policies and apply them to roots, OUs, and ac-
       counts:

          aws organizations enable-all-features

       The output is a handshake object that is sent to all invited member ac-
       counts for approval:

          {
                  "Handshake": {
                          "Action": "ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES",

OUTPUT
       Handshake -> (structure)
          A  structure  that  contains  details about the handshake created to
          support this request to enable all features in the organization.

          Id -> (string)
              The unique identifier (ID) of a handshake. The  originating  ac-
              count creates the ID when it initiates the handshake.

              The regex pattern for handshake ID string requires "h-" followed
              by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a handshake.

              For more information about ARNs in Organizations, see  ARN  For-
              mats Supported by Organizations in the AWS Service Authorization
              Reference .

          Parties -> (list)
              Information about the two accounts that are participating in the
              handshake.

              (structure)
                 Identifies a participant in a handshake.

                 Id -> (string)
                     The unique identifier (ID) for the party.

                     The  regex  pattern for handshake ID string requires "h-"
                     followed by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of party.

          State -> (string)
              The current state of the handshake. Use the state to  trace  the
              flow  of  the handshake through the process from its creation to
              its acceptance. The meaning of each of the valid  values  is  as
              follows:

              o REQUESTED  :  This  handshake  was sent to multiple recipients
                (applicable to only some handshake types) and not all  recipi-
                ents have responded yet. The request stays in this state until
                all recipients respond.

              o OPEN : This handshake was sent to multiple recipients  (appli-
                cable  to  only some policy types) and all recipients have re-
                sponded, allowing the originator to complete the handshake ac-
                tion.

              o CANCELED  :  This handshake is no longer active because it was
                canceled by the originating account.

              o ACCEPTED : This handshake is complete because it has been  ac-
                cepted by the recipient.

              o DECLINED  :  This handshake is no longer active because it was
                declined by the recipient account.

              o EXPIRED : This handshake is no longer active because the orig-
                inator did not receive a response of any kind from the recipi-
                ent before the expiration time (15 days).

          RequestedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the handshake request was made.

          ExpirationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the handshake expires. If  the  recipient
              of  the  handshake request fails to respond before the specified
              date and time, the handshake becomes inactive and is  no  longer
              valid.

          Action -> (string)
              The  type  of  handshake, indicating what action occurs when the
              recipient accepts the handshake. The following  handshake  types
              are supported:

              o INVITE  :  This type of handshake represents a request to join
                an organization. It is always sent from the management account
                to only non-member accounts.

              o ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES  : This type of handshake represents a re-
                quest to enable all features in an organization. It is  always
                sent  from  the  management account to only invited member ac-
                counts. Created accounts do not receive this because those ac-
                counts  were  created by the organization's management account
                and approval is inferred.

              o APPROVE_ALL_FEATURES : This type of handshake is sent from the
                Organizations  service  when all member accounts have approved
                the ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES invitation. It is  sent  only  to  the
                management account and signals the master that it can finalize
                the process to enable all features.

          Resources -> (list)
              Additional information that is needed to process the handshake.

              (structure)
                 Contains additional data that is needed to  process  a  hand-
                 shake.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  information that is passed to the other party in the
                     handshake. The format of the value string must match  the
                     requirements of the specified type.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The  type of information being passed, specifying how the
                     value is to be interpreted by the other party:

                     o NOTES  - Additional text provided by the handshake ini-
                       tiator and intended for the recipient to read.

                 Resources -> (list)
                     When needed, contains an additional array of HandshakeRe-
                     source objects.

                     (structure)
                        Contains  additional  data that is needed to process a
                        handshake.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The information that is passed to the other  party
                            in  the  handshake. The format of the value string
                            must match the requirements of the specified type.
