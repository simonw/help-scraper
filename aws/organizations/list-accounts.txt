LIST-ACCOUNTS()                                                LIST-ACCOUNTS()



NAME
       list-accounts -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  the  accounts  in the organization. To request only the ac-
       counts in a specified root or organizational unit (OU), use  the   Lis-
       tAccountsForParent operation instead.

       NOTE:
          Always  check the NextToken response parameter for a null value when
          calling a List* operation. These operations can occasionally  return
          an  empty set of results even when there are more results available.
          The NextToken response parameter value is null  only when there  are
          no more results to display.

       This  operation  can  be called only from the organization's management
       account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an
       AWS service.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-accounts  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Accounts

SYNOPSIS
            list-accounts
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve a list of all of the accounts in an organization

       The  following  example shows you how to request a list of the accounts
       in an organization:

          aws organizations list-accounts

       The output includes a list of account summary objects.

OUTPUT
       Accounts -> (list)
          A list of objects in the organization.

          (structure)
              Contains information about an AWS account that is a member of an
              organization.

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier (ID) of the account.

                 The  regex  pattern for an account ID string requires exactly
                 12 digits.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the account.

                 For more information about ARNs  in  Organizations,  see  ARN
                 Formats  Supported by Organizations in the AWS Service Autho-
                 rization Reference .

              Email -> (string)
                 The email address associated with the AWS account.

                 The regex pattern for this parameter is a string  of  charac-
                 ters that represents a standard internet email address.

              Name -> (string)
                 The friendly name of the account.

                 The  regex pattern that is used to validate this parameter is
                 a string of any of the  characters  in  the  ASCII  character
                 range.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the account in the organization.

              JoinedMethod -> (string)
                 The method by which the account joined the organization.

              JoinedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The date the account became a part of the organization.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If present, indicates that more output is available than is included
          in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken request pa-
          rameter  in  a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part
          of the output. You should repeat this until the  NextToken  response
          element comes back as null .
