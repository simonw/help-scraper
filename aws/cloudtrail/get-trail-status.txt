GET-TRAIL-STATUS()                                          GET-TRAIL-STATUS()



NAME
       get-trail-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a JSON-formatted list of information about the specified trail.
       Fields include information on delivery errors, Amazon SNS and Amazon S3
       errors, and start and stop logging times for each trail. This operation
       returns trail status from a single region. To return trail status  from
       all regions, you must call the operation on each region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-trail-status
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Specifies  the name or the CloudTrail ARN of the trail for which you
          are requesting status. To get the status of a shadow trail (a repli-
          cation  of  the  trail in another region), you must specify its ARN.
          The following is the format of a trail ARN.
              arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the status of a trail

       The following get-trail-status command returns the delivery and logging
       details for Trail1:

          aws cloudtrail get-trail-status --name Trail1

       Output:

          {
            "LatestNotificationTime": 1454022144.869,

          }

OUTPUT
       IsLogging -> (boolean)
          Whether  the  CloudTrail  trail is currently logging Amazon Web Ser-
          vices API calls.

       LatestDeliveryError -> (string)
          Displays any Amazon S3 error that CloudTrail  encountered  when  at-

          NOTE:
              This error occurs only when there is a problem with the destina-
              tion  S3  bucket, and does not occur for requests that time out.
              To resolve the issue, create a new bucket, and then call Update-
              Trail  to specify the new bucket; or fix the existing objects so
              that CloudTrail can again write to the bucket.

       LatestNotificationError -> (string)
          Displays any Amazon SNS error that CloudTrail encountered  when  at-
          tempting  to  send a notification. For more information about Amazon
          SNS errors, see the Amazon SNS Developer Guide .

       LatestDeliveryTime -> (timestamp)
          Specifies the date and time that CloudTrail last delivered log files
          to an account's Amazon S3 bucket.

       LatestNotificationTime -> (timestamp)
          Specifies  the date and time of the most recent Amazon SNS notifica-
          tion that CloudTrail has written a new log file to an account's Ama-
          zon S3 bucket.

       StartLoggingTime -> (timestamp)
          Specifies  the  most  recent  date  and time when CloudTrail started
          recording API calls for an Amazon Web Services account.

          recording API calls for an Amazon Web Services account.

       LatestCloudWatchLogsDeliveryError -> (string)
          Displays  any CloudWatch Logs error that CloudTrail encountered when
          attempting to deliver logs to CloudWatch Logs.

       LatestCloudWatchLogsDeliveryTime -> (timestamp)
          Displays the most recent date and  time  when  CloudTrail  delivered
          logs to CloudWatch Logs.

       LatestDigestDeliveryTime -> (timestamp)
          Specifies  the date and time that CloudTrail last delivered a digest
          file to an account's Amazon S3 bucket.

       LatestDigestDeliveryError -> (string)
          Displays any Amazon S3 error that CloudTrail  encountered  when  at-
          tempting to deliver a digest file to the designated bucket. For more

          NOTE:
              This error occurs only when there is a problem with the destina-
              tion  S3  bucket, and does not occur for requests that time out.
