DELETE-EVENT-DATA-STORE()                            DELETE-EVENT-DATA-STORE()



NAME
       delete-event-data-store -

DESCRIPTION
       Disables  the  event data store specified by EventDataStore , which ac-
       cepts an event data store ARN. After you run DeleteEventDataStore , the
       event  data store enters a PENDING_DELETION state, and is automatically
       deleted after a wait period of seven days. TerminationProtectionEnabled
       must  be  set  to  False on the event data store; this operation cannot
       work if TerminationProtectionEnabled is True .

       After you run DeleteEventDataStore on an event data store,  you  cannot
       run  ListQueries  ,  DescribeQuery , or GetQueryResults on queries that
       are using an event data store in a  PENDING_DELETION  state.  An  event
       data store in the PENDING_DELETION state does not incur costs.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-event-data-store
          --event-data-store <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --event-data-store (string)
          The  ARN  (or  the  ID suffix of the ARN) of the event data store to
          delete.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
