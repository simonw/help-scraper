UPDATE-TRAIL()                                                  UPDATE-TRAIL()



NAME
       update-trail -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  trail  settings  that control what events you are logging, and
       how to handle log files. Changes to a trail do not require stopping the
       CloudTrail service. Use this action to designate an existing bucket for
       log delivery. If the existing bucket has previously been a  target  for
       CloudTrail  log files, an IAM policy exists for the bucket. UpdateTrail
       must be called from the Region in which the trail was  created;  other-
       wise, an InvalidHomeRegionException is thrown.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Specifies  the  name  of  the trail or trail ARN. If Name is a trail
          name, the string must meet the following requirements:

          o Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.),
            underscores (_), or dashes (-)

          o Start with a letter or number, and end with a letter or number

          o Be between 3 and 128 characters

          o Have  no  adjacent  periods,  underscores  or  dashes.  Names like
            my-_namespace and my--namespace are not valid.

          o Not be in IP address format (for example, 192.168.5.4)

          If Name is a trail ARN, it must be in the following format.
              arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail

       --s3-bucket-name (string)
          Specifies the name of the Amazon S3 bucket designated for publishing
          log files. See Amazon S3 Bucket naming rules .

       --s3-key-prefix (string)
          Specifies  the Amazon S3 key prefix that comes after the name of the
          bucket you have designated for log file delivery. For more  informa-
          tion,  see Finding Your CloudTrail Log Files . The maximum length is
          200 characters.

       --sns-topic-name (string)
          Specifies the name of the Amazon SNS topic defined for  notification
          of log file delivery. The maximum length is 256 characters.

       --include-global-service-events   |  --no-include-global-service-events
       (boolean)
          Specifies whether the trail is publishing events  from  global  ser-
          vices such as IAM to the log files.

       --is-multi-region-trail | --no-is-multi-region-trail (boolean)
          Specifies whether the trail applies only to the current Region or to
          all Regions. The default is false. If the trail exists only  in  the
          current  Region and this value is set to true, shadow trails (repli-
          cations of the trail) will be created in the other Regions.  If  the
          trail  exists  in  all  Regions  and this value is set to false, the
          trail will remain in the Region where it was created, and its shadow
          trails  in  other  Regions will be deleted. As a best practice, con-
          sider using trails that log events in all Regions.

       --enable-log-file-validation |  --no-enable-log-file-validation  (bool-
       ean)
          Specifies  whether  log  file  validation is enabled. The default is
          false.

          NOTE:
              When you disable log file integrity validation, the chain of di-
              gest  files is broken after one hour. CloudTrail does not create
              digest files for log files that were delivered during  a  period
              in  which  log file integrity validation was disabled. For exam-
              ple, if you enable log file integrity validation at noon on Jan-
              uary  1,  disable  it  at noon on January 2, and re-enable it at
              noon on January 10, digest files will not be created for the log
              files  delivered  from  noon on January 2 to noon on January 10.
              The same applies whenever you stop CloudTrail logging or  delete
              a trail.

       --cloud-watch-logs-log-group-arn (string)
          Specifies  a  log  group name using an Amazon Resource Name (ARN), a
          unique identifier that represents the log group to which  CloudTrail
          logs are delivered. You must use a log group that exists in your ac-
          count.

          Not required unless you specify CloudWatchLogsRoleArn .

       --cloud-watch-logs-role-arn (string)
          Specifies the role for the CloudWatch Logs  endpoint  to  assume  to
          write to a user's log group. You must use a role that exists in your
          account.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          Specifies the KMS key ID to use to encrypt  the  logs  delivered  by
          CloudTrail.  The  value can be an alias name prefixed by "alias/", a
          fully specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key,  or
          a globally unique identifier.

          CloudTrail also supports KMS multi-Region keys. For more information
          about multi-Region keys, see Using multi-Region keys in the Key Man-
          agement Service Developer Guide .

          Examples:

          o alias/MyAliasName

          o arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName

          o arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

          o 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

       --is-organization-trail | --no-is-organization-trail (boolean)
          Specifies whether the trail is applied to all accounts in an organi-
          zation in Organizations, or only for the current Amazon Web Services
          account. The default is false, and cannot be true unless the call is
          made on behalf of an Amazon Web Services account that is the manage-
          ment account for an organization in Organizations. If the  trail  is
          not  an  organization trail and this is set to true , the trail will
          be created in all Amazon Web Services accounts that  belong  to  the
          organization.  If the trail is an organization trail and this is set
          to false , the trail will remain in the current Amazon Web  Services
          account but be deleted from all member accounts in the organization.

          NOTE:
              Only  the management account for the organization can convert an
              organization trail to a non-organization  trail,  or  convert  a
              non-organization trail to an organization trail.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
