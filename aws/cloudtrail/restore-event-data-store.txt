RESTORE-EVENT-DATA-STORE()                          RESTORE-EVENT-DATA-STORE()



NAME
       restore-event-data-store -

DESCRIPTION
       Restores a deleted event data store specified by EventDataStore , which
       accepts an event data store ARN. You can only restore a  deleted  event
       data  store  within the seven-day wait period after deletion. Restoring
       an event data store can take several minutes, depending on the size  of
       the event data store.

OPTIONS
       --event-data-store (string)
          The  ARN  (or the ID suffix of the ARN) of the event data store that
          you want to restore.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       EventDataStoreArn -> (string)
          The event data store ARN.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the event data store.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the event data store.

       AdvancedEventSelectors -> (list)
          The advanced event selectors that were used to select events.

          (structure)
              Advanced  event  selectors let you create fine-grained selectors
              for the following CloudTrail event record elds.  They  help  you
              control costs by logging only those events that are important to
              you. For more information about advanced  event  selectors,  see
              Logging data events for trails in the CloudTrail User Guide .

              o readOnly

              o eventSource

              o eventName

              o eventCategory

              o resources.type

              o resources.ARN

              You  cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selec-
              tors to a trail.

              Name -> (string)
                 An optional, descriptive name for an advanced event selector,
                 such as "Log data events for only two S3 buckets".

              FieldSelectors -> (list)
                 Contains  all selector statements in an advanced event selec-
                 tor.

                 (structure)
                     A single selector statement in an advanced  event  selec-
                     tor.

                     Field -> (string)
                        A  field  in an event record on which to filter events
                        to be logged.  Supported  fields  include  readOnly  ,
                        eventCategory  ,  eventSource (for management events),
                        eventName , resources.type , and resources.ARN .

                        o

                          **
                          readOnly ** - Optional. Can be set to Equals a value
                          of  true  or  false  . If you do not add this field,
                          CloudTrail logs both read and write events. A  value
                          of true logs only read events. A value of false logs
                          only write events.

                          to  lter  in  or  lter  out any data event logged to
                          CloudTrail, such as PutBucket or GetSnapshotBlock  .
                          You can have multiple values for this eld, separated
                          by commas.

                          sources.type  can  only use the Equals operator, and
                          the value can be one of the following:

                        You can have only one resources.type eld per selector.
                        To log data events on more than one resource type, add
                        another selector.

                          **
                          resources.ARN ** - You can use any operator with re-
                          sources.ARN  ,  but if you use Equals or NotEquals ,
                          the value must exactly match the ARN of a valid  re-
                          source of the type you've specied in the template as
                          the value of resources.type.  For  example,  if  re-
                          sources.type  equals  AWS::S3::Object , the ARN must
                          be in one of the following formats. To log all  data
                          events  for all objects in a specific S3 bucket, use
                          the StartsWith operator, and include only the bucket
                          ARN as the matching value. The trailing slash is in-
                          tentional; do not exclude it. Replace the  text  be-
                          tween  less  than and greater than symbols (<>) with
                          resource-specific information.
