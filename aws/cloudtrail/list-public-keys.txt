LIST-PUBLIC-KEYS()                                          LIST-PUBLIC-KEYS()



NAME
       list-public-keys -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns all public keys whose private keys were used to sign the digest
       files within the specified time range. The public key is needed to val-
       idate digest files that were signed with its corresponding private key.

       NOTE:
          CloudTrail  uses  different private and public key pairs per region.
          Each digest file is signed with a private key unique to its  region.
          When  you  validate  a  digest file from a specific region, you must
          look in the same region for its corresponding public key.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-public-keys is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: PublicKeyList

SYNOPSIS
            list-public-keys
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --start-time (timestamp)
          Optionally specifies, in UTC, the start of the time range to look up
          public keys for CloudTrail digest files. If not specified, the  cur-
          rent time is used, and the current public key is returned.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          Optionally  specifies,  in UTC, the end of the time range to look up
          public keys for CloudTrail digest files. If not specified, the  cur-
          rent time is used.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list all public keys for a trail

       The  following  list-public-keys  command returns all public keys whose
       private keys were used to sign the digest files  within  the  specified
       time range:

          aws cloudtrail list-public-keys --start-time 2016-01-01T20:30:00.000Z

       Output:

          {
            "PublicKeyList": [
                {
                   "ValidityStartTime": 1453076702.0,
                   "ValidityEndTime": 1455668702.0,
                   "Value": "MIIBCgKCAQEAlSS3cl92HDycr/MTj0moOhas8habjrraXw+KzlWF0axSI2tcF+3iJ9BKQAVSKxGwxwu3m0wG3J+kUl1xboEcEPHYoIYMbgfSw7KGnuDKwkLzsQWhUJ0cIbOHASox1vv/5fNXkrHhGbDCHeVXm804c83nvHUEFYThr1PfyP/8HwrCtR3FX5OANtQCP61C1nJtSSkC8JSQUOrIP4CuwJjc+4WGDk+BGH5m9iuiAKkipEHWmUl8/P7XpfpWQuk4h8g3pXZOrNXr08lbh4d39svj7UqdhvOXoBISp9t/EXYuePGEtBdrKD9Dz+VHwyUPtBQvYr9BnkF88qBnaPNhS44rzwIDAQAB",

          Contains an array of PublicKey objects.

          NOTE:
