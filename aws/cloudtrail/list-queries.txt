NAME
       list-queries -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of queries and query statuses for the past seven days.
       You must specify an ARN  value  for  EventDataStore  .  Optionally,  to
       shorten the list of results, you can specify a time range, formatted as
       timestamps, by adding StartTime and EndTime parameters, and a QuerySta-
       tus value. Valid values for QueryStatus include QUEUED , RUNNING , FIN-
       ISHED , FAILED , TIMED_OUT , or CANCELLED .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-queries
          --event-data-store <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--query-status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --event-data-store (string)
          The ARN (or the ID suffix of the ARN) of  an  event  data  store  on
          which queries were run.

       --next-token (string)
          A token you can use to get the next page of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of queries to show on a page.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          Use  with  EndTime to bound a ListQueries request, and limit its re-
          sults to only those queries run within a specified time period.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          Use with StartTime to bound a ListQueries request, and limit its re-
          sults to only those queries run within a specified time period.

       --query-status (string)
          The status of queries that you want to return in results. Valid val-
          ues for QueryStatus include QUEUED , RUNNING , FINISHED ,  FAILED  ,
          TIMED_OUT , or CANCELLED .

          Possible values:

          o QUEUED

          o RUNNING

          o FINISHED

          o FAILED

          o CANCELLED

          o TIMED_OUT

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
