GET-INSIGHT-SELECTORS()                                GET-INSIGHT-SELECTORS()



NAME
       get-insight-selectors -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  settings for the Insights event selectors that you con-
       figured for your trail. GetInsightSelectors  shows  if  CloudTrail  In-
       sights  event  logging is enabled on the trail, and if it is, which in-
       sight types are enabled. If you run GetInsightSelectors on a trail that
       does  not have Insights events enabled, the operation throws the excep-
       tion InsightNotEnabledException

       For more information, see Logging CloudTrail Insights Events for Trails
       in the CloudTrail User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-insight-selectors
          --trail-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --trail-name (string)
          Specifies the name of the trail or trail ARN. If you specify a trail
          name, the string must meet the following requirements:

          o Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.),
            underscores (_), or dashes (-)

          o Start with a letter or number, and end with a letter or number

          o Be between 3 and 128 characters

          o Have  no  adjacent  periods,  underscores  or  dashes.  Names like
            my-_namespace and my--namespace are not valid.

          o Not be in IP address format (for example, 192.168.5.4)

          If you specify a trail ARN, it must be in the format:
              arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
