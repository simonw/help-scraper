NAME
       put-insight-selectors -

DESCRIPTION
       Lets  you  enable Insights event logging by specifying the Insights se-
       lectors that you want to enable on an  existing  trail.  You  also  use
       PutInsightSelectors  to  turn off Insights event logging, by passing an
       empty list of insight types. The valid Insights event types in this re-
       lease are ApiErrorRateInsight and ApiCallRateInsight .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-insight-selectors
          --trail-name <value>
          --insight-selectors <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --trail-name (string)
          The name of the CloudTrail trail for which you want to change or add
          Insights selectors.

       --insight-selectors (list)
          A JSON string that contains the insight types you want to log  on  a
          trail.  ApiCallRateInsight and ApiErrorRateInsight are valid insight
          types.

          (structure)
              A JSON string that contains a list of  insight  types  that  are
              logged on a trail.

              InsightType -> (string)
                 The  type  of  insights to log on a trail. ApiCallRateInsight
                 and ApiErrorRateInsight are valid insight types.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          InsightType=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "InsightType": "ApiCallRateInsight"|"ApiErrorRateInsight"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       InsightSelectors -> (list)
          A  JSON  string that contains the Insights event types that you want
          to log on a trail. The valid Insights  types  in  this  release  are
          ApiErrorRateInsight and ApiCallRateInsight .
