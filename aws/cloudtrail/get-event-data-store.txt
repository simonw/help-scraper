GET-EVENT-DATA-STORE()                                  GET-EVENT-DATA-STORE()



NAME
       get-event-data-store -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  an event data store specified as either an
       ARN or the ID portion of the ARN.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-event-data-store
          --event-data-store <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --event-data-store (string)
          The ARN (or ID suffix of the ARN) of  the  event  data  store  about
          which you want information.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EventDataStoreArn -> (string)
          The event data store Amazon Resource Number (ARN).

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the event data store.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of an event data store. Values can be ENABLED  and  PEND-
          ING_DELETION .

       AdvancedEventSelectors -> (list)
          The  advanced  event  selectors  used  to select events for the data
          store.

          (structure)
              Advanced event selectors let you create  fine-grained  selectors
              for  the  following  CloudTrail event record elds. They help you
              control costs by logging only those events that are important to
              you.  For  more  information about advanced event selectors, see
              Logging data events for trails in the CloudTrail User Guide .

              o readOnly

              o eventSource

              o eventName

              o eventCategory

              o resources.type

              o resources.ARN

              You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event  selec-
              tors to a trail.

              Name -> (string)
                 An optional, descriptive name for an advanced event selector,
                 such as "Log data events for only two S3 buckets".

              FieldSelectors -> (list)
                 Contains all selector statements in an advanced event  selec-
                 tor.

                 (structure)
                     A  single  selector statement in an advanced event selec-
                     tor.

                     Field -> (string)
                        A field in an event record on which to  filter  events
                        to  be  logged.  Supported  fields  include readOnly ,
                        eventCategory , eventSource (for  management  events),
                        eventName , resources.type , and resources.ARN .

                        o

                          **
                          readOnly ** - Optional. Can be set to Equals a value
                          of true or false . If you do  not  add  this  field,
                          CloudTrail  logs  both both read and write events. A
                          value of true logs only  read  events.  A  value  of
                          false logs only write events.

                          CloudTrail,  such as PutBucket or GetSnapshotBlock .
                          You can have multiple values for this eld, separated
                          by commas.

                          to Equals , and the value must be Management or Data
                          .

                          sources.type can only use the Equals  operator,  and
                          the value can be one of the following:

                        You can have only one resources.type eld per selector.
                        To log data events on more than one resource type, add
                        another selector.

                          **
                          resources.ARN ** - You can use any operator with re-
                          sources.ARN , but if you use Equals or  NotEquals  ,
                          the  value must exactly match the ARN of a valid re-
                          source of the type you've specied in the template as
                          the  value  of  resources.type.  For example, if re-
                          sources.type equals AWS::S3::Object , the  ARN  must
                          be  in one of the following formats. To log all data
                          events for all objects in a specific S3 bucket,  use
                          the StartsWith operator, and include only the bucket
                          ARN as the matching value. The trailing slash is in-
                          tentional;  do  not exclude it. Replace the text be-
                          tween less than and greater than symbols  (<>)  with
                          resource-specific information.

                        StartsWith operators.
