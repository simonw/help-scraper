NAME
       describe-trails -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  settings  for one or more trails associated with the current
       region for your account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-trails
          [--trail-name-list <value>]
          [--include-shadow-trails | --no-include-shadow-trails]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --trail-name-list (list)
          Specifies a list of trail names, trail ARNs, or both, of the  trails
          to describe. The format of a trail ARN is:
              arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail

          If an empty list is specified, information for the trail in the cur-
          rent region is returned.

          o If an empty list is specified and  IncludeShadowTrails  is  false,
            then information for all trails in the current region is returned.

          o If  an  empty list is specified and IncludeShadowTrails is null or
            true, then information for all trails in the  current  region  and
            any associated shadow trails in other regions is returned.

          NOTE:
              If  one  or  more  trail names are specified, information is re-
              turned only if the names match the  names  of  trails  belonging
              only  to the current region. To return information about a trail
              in another region, you must specify its trail ARN.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --include-shadow-trails | --no-include-shadow-trails (boolean)
          Specifies whether to include shadow trails in the response. A shadow
          trail  is the replication in a region of a trail that was created in
          a different region, or in the case of  an  organization  trail,  the
          replication  of  an organization trail in member accounts. If you do
          not include shadow trails, organization trails in a  member  account
          and  region  replication trails will not be returned. The default is
          true.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a trail

       The  following  describe-trails command returns the settings for Trail1
       and Trail2:

          aws cloudtrail describe-trails --trail-name-list Trail1 Trail2

       Output:

OUTPUT
       trailList -> (list)
          The list of trail objects. Trail objects with string values are only
          returned if values for the objects exist in a trail's configuration.
          For example, SNSTopicName and SNSTopicARN are only returned  in  re-
          sults if a trail is configured to send SNS notifications. Similarly,
          KMSKeyId only appears in results if a  trail's  log  files  are  en-
          crypted with KMS customer managed keys.
