UPDATE-EVENT-DATA-STORE()                            UPDATE-EVENT-DATA-STORE()



NAME
       update-event-data-store -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  an  event  data store. The required EventDataStore value is an
       ARN or the ID portion of the ARN. Other parameters are optional, but at
       least one optional parameter must be specified, or CloudTrail throws an
       error. RetentionPeriod is in days, and valid values  are  integers  be-
       tween  90  and  2557. By default, TerminationProtection is enabled. Ad-
       vancedEventSelectors includes or excludes management and data events in
       your  event  data store; for more information about AdvancedEventSelec-
       tors , see  PutEventSelectorsRequest$AdvancedEventSelectors .

OPTIONS
       --event-data-store (string)
          The ARN (or the ID suffix of the ARN) of the event data  store  that
          you want to update.

       --name (string)
          The event data store name.

       --advanced-event-selectors (list)
          The  advanced  event  selectors  used to select events for the event
          data store. You can configure up to five  advanced  event  selectors
          for each event data store.

          (structure)
              Advanced  event  selectors let you create fine-grained selectors
              for the following CloudTrail event record elds.  They  help  you
              control costs by logging only those events that are important to
              you. For more information about advanced  event  selectors,  see
              Logging data events for trails in the CloudTrail User Guide .

              o readOnly

              o eventSource

              o eventName

              o eventCategory

              o resources.type

              o resources.ARN

              You  cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selec-
              tors to a trail.

              Name -> (string)
                 An optional, descriptive name for an advanced event selector,
                 such as "Log data events for only two S3 buckets".

              FieldSelectors -> (list)
                 Contains  all selector statements in an advanced event selec-
                 tor.

                 (structure)
                     A single selector statement in an advanced  event  selec-
                     tor.

                     Field -> (string)
                        A  field  in an event record on which to filter events
                        to be logged.  Supported  fields  include  readOnly  ,
                        eventCategory  ,  eventSource (for management events),
                        eventName , resources.type , and resources.ARN .

                        o

                          **
                          readOnly ** - Optional. Can be set to Equals a value
                          of  true  or  false  . If you do not add this field,
                          CloudTrail logs both read and write events. A  value
                          of true logs only read events. A value of false logs
                          only write events.

                          **
                          eventName ** - Can use any operator. You can use  it
                          to  lter  in  or  lter  out any data event logged to
                          CloudTrail, such as PutBucket or GetSnapshotBlock  .
                          You can have multiple values for this eld, separated
                          by commas.

                          eventCategory ** - This is required. It must be  set
                          to Equals , and the value must be Management or Data
                          .

                          sources.type  can  only use the Equals operator, and
                          the value can be one of the following:

                        You can have only one resources.type eld per selector.
                        To log data events on more than one resource type, add
                        another selector.

                          **
                          resources.ARN ** - You can use any operator with re-
                          sources.ARN  ,  but if you use Equals or NotEquals ,
                          the value must exactly match the ARN of a valid  re-
                          source of the type you've specied in the template as
                          the value of resources.type.  For  example,  if  re-
                          sources.type  equals  AWS::S3::Object , the ARN must
                          be in one of the following formats. To log all  data
                          events  for all objects in a specific S3 bucket, use
                          the StartsWith operator, and include only the bucket
                          ARN as the matching value. The trailing slash is in-
                          tentional; do not exclude it. Replace the  text  be-
                          tween  less  than and greater than symbols (<>) with
                          resource-specific information.

                        the  object  path,  and  use  the  StartsWith  or Not-
                        StartsWith operators.

       --multi-region-enabled | --no-multi-region-enabled (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  an event data store collects events from all re-
          gions, or only from the region in which it was created.

       --organization-enabled | --no-organization-enabled (boolean)
          Specifies whether an event data store collects events logged for  an
          organization in Organizations.

       --retention-period (integer)
          The retention period, in days.

       --termination-protection-enabled  | --no-termination-protection-enabled
       (boolean)
          Indicates that termination protection is enabled and the event  data
          store cannot be automatically deleted.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       EventDataStoreArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the event data store.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the event data store.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of an event data store. Values can be ENABLED  and  PEND-
          ING_DELETION .

       AdvancedEventSelectors -> (list)
          The  advanced  event  selectors  that  are applied to the event data
          store.

          (structure)
              Advanced event selectors let you create  fine-grained  selectors
              for  the  following  CloudTrail event record elds. They help you
              control costs by logging only those events that are important to
              you.  For  more  information about advanced event selectors, see
              Logging data events for trails in the CloudTrail User Guide .

              o resources.ARN

              You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event  selec-
              tors to a trail.

              Name -> (string)

                 Contains all selector statements in an advanced event  selec-
                 tor.

                     A  single  selector statement in an advanced event selec-
                     tor.

                     Field -> (string)
                        A field in an event record on which to  filter  events
                        to  be  logged.  Supported  fields  include readOnly ,
                        eventCategory , eventSource (for  management  events),
                        eventName , resources.type , and resources.ARN .

                          of true or false . If you do  not  add  this  field,
                          CloudTrail  logs both read and write events. A value
                          of true logs only read events. A value of false logs
                          only write events.

                          be  in one of the following formats. To log all data
                          events for all objects in a specific S3 bucket,  use
                          the StartsWith operator, and include only the bucket
                          ARN as the matching value. The trailing slash is in-
