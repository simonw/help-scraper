OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the event data store.

       --advanced-event-selectors (list)
          The  advanced  event  selectors  to use to select the events for the
          data store. For more information about how to use advanced event se-
          lectors,  see  Log  events  by using advanced event selectors in the
          CloudTrail User Guide.

          (structure)
              Advanced event selectors let you create  fine-grained  selectors
              for  the  following  CloudTrail event record elds. They help you
              control costs by logging only those events that are important to
              you.  For  more  information about advanced event selectors, see
              Logging data events for trails in the CloudTrail User Guide .

              o readOnly

              o eventSource

              o eventName

              o eventCategory

              o resources.type

              o resources.ARN

              You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event  selec-
              tors to a trail.

              Name -> (string)
                 An optional, descriptive name for an advanced event selector,
                 such as "Log data events for only two S3 buckets".

              FieldSelectors -> (list)
                 Contains all selector statements in an advanced event  selec-
                 tor.

                 (structure)
                     A  single  selector statement in an advanced event selec-
                     tor.

                     Field -> (string)
                        A field in an event record on which to  filter  events
                        to  be  logged.  Supported  fields  include readOnly ,
                        eventCategory , eventSource (for  management  events),
                        eventName , resources.type , and resources.ARN .

                        o

                          **
                          readOnly ** - Optional. Can be set to Equals a value
                          of true or false . If you do  not  add  this  field,
                          CloudTrail  logs  both both read and write events. A
                          value of true logs only  read  events.  A  value  of
                          false logs only write events.

                          **
                          eventName  ** - Can use any operator. You can use it
                          to lter in or lter out  any  data  event  logged  to
                          CloudTrail,  such as PutBucket or GetSnapshotBlock .
                          You can have multiple values for this eld, separated
                          by commas.

                          **
                          eventCategory  ** - This is required. It must be set
                          to Equals , and the value must be Management or Data
                          .

                          sources.type can only use the Equals  operator,  and
                          the value can be one of the following:

                        You can have only one resources.type eld per selector.
                        To log data events on more than one resource type, add
                        another selector.

                        o

                          **
                          resources.ARN ** - You can use any operator with re-
                          sources.ARN , but if you use Equals or  NotEquals  ,
                          the  value must exactly match the ARN of a valid re-
                          source of the type you've specied in the template as
                          the  value  of  resources.type.  For example, if re-
                          sources.type equals AWS::S3::Object , the  ARN  must
                          be  in one of the following formats. To log all data
                          events for all objects in a specific S3 bucket,  use
                          the StartsWith operator, and include only the bucket
                          ARN as the matching value. The trailing slash is in-
                          tentional;  do  not exclude it. Replace the text be-
                          tween less than and greater than symbols  (<>)  with
                          resource-specific information.

                        the object  path,  and  use  the  StartsWith  or  Not-
                        StartsWith operators.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON

       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EventDataStoreArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the event data store.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the event data store.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of event data store creation.

       AdvancedEventSelectors -> (list)
          The advanced event selectors that were used to select the events for
          the data store.

          (structure)
              Advanced  event  selectors let you create fine-grained selectors
              for the following CloudTrail event record elds.  They  help  you
              control costs by logging only those events that are important to
              you. For more information about advanced  event  selectors,  see
              Logging data events for trails in the CloudTrail User Guide .

              You  cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selec-
              tors to a trail.

              Name -> (string)
                 An optional, descriptive name for an advanced event selector,
                 such as "Log data events for only two S3 buckets".

              FieldSelectors -> (list)
                 Contains  all selector statements in an advanced event selec-
                 tor.

                 (structure)
                     A single selector statement in an advanced  event  selec-
                     tor.

                     Field -> (string)
                        A  field  in an event record on which to filter events
                        to be logged.  Supported  fields  include  readOnly  ,
                        eventCategory  ,  eventSource (for management events),
                        eventName , resources.type , and resources.ARN .

                          of  true  or  false  . If you do not add this field,
                          CloudTrail logs both both read and write  events.  A
                          value  of  true  logs  only  read events. A value of
                          false logs only write events.

                          be in one of the following formats. To log all  data
