CREATE-ATTRIBUTE-GROUP()                              CREATE-ATTRIBUTE-GROUP()



NAME
       create-attribute-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new  attribute  group  as  a container for user-defined at-
       tributes. This feature enables users to have full  control  over  their
       cloud  application's  metadata in a rich machine-readable format to fa-
       cilitate integration with automated workflows and third-party tools.

SYNOPSIS
            create-attribute-group
          --name <value>
          [--description <value>]
          --attributes <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the attribute group.

       --description (string)
          The description of the attribute group that the user provides.

       --attributes (string)
          A JSON string in the form of nested key-value pairs  that  represent
          the  attributes  in  the  group and describes an application and its
          components.

       --tags (map)
          Key-value pairs you can use to associate with the attribute group.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --client-token (string)
          A unique identifier that you provide to ensure idempotency.  If  you
          retry  a  request  that completed successfully using the same client
          token and the same parameters, the retry succeeds without performing
          any  further  actions.  If  you retry a successful request using the
          same client token, but one or more of the parameters are  different,
          the retry fails.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       attributeGroup -> (structure)
          Information about the attribute group.

          id -> (string)
              The  globally unique attribute group identifier of the attribute
              group.

          arn -> (string)
              The Amazon resource name  (ARN)  that  specifies  the  attribute
              group across services.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the attribute group.

          description -> (string)
              The description of the attribute group that the user provides.

          creationTime -> (timestamp)
              The  ISO-8601  formatted  timestamp  of the moment the attribute
              group was created.

          lastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
              The ISO-8601 formatted timestamp of  the  moment  the  attribute
              group  was  last updated. This time is the same as the creation-
              Time for a newly created attribute group.

          tags -> (map)
              Key-value pairs you can use  to  associate  with  the  attribute
              group.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)
