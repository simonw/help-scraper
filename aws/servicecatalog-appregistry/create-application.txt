       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-application
          --name <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the application. The name must be unique in  the  region
          in which you are creating the application.

       --description (string)
          The description of the application.

       --tags (map)
          Key-value pairs you can use to associate with the application.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique  identifier that you provide to ensure idempotency. If you
          retry a request that completed successfully using  the  same  client
          token and the same parameters, the retry succeeds without performing
          any further actions. If you retry a  successful  request  using  the
          same  client token, but one or more of the parameters are different,
          the retry fails.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
