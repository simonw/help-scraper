NAME
       post-text -

DESCRIPTION
       Sends user input to Amazon Lex. Client applications can use this API to
       send requests to Amazon Lex at runtime. Amazon Lex then interprets  the
       user input using the machine learning model it built for the bot.

       In  response, Amazon Lex returns the next message to convey to the user
       an optional responseCard to display.  Consider  the  following  example
       messages:

       o For  a  user  input "I would like a pizza", Amazon Lex might return a
         response with a message eliciting slot data (for example, PizzaSize):
         "What size pizza would you like?"

       o After  the  user  provides all of the pizza order information, Amazon
         Lex might return a response with a message to obtain  user  confirma-
         tion "Proceed with the pizza order?".

       o After  the user replies to a confirmation prompt with a "yes", Amazon
         Lex might return a conclusion  statement:  "Thank  you,  your  cheese
         pizza has been ordered.".

       Not  all  Amazon  Lex  messages require a user response. For example, a
       conclusion statement does not require a response. Some messages require
       only a "yes" or "no" user response. In addition to the message , Amazon
       Lex provides additional context about the message in the response  that
       you  might  use to enhance client behavior, for example, to display the
       appropriate client user interface. These are  the  slotToElicit  ,  di-
       alogState , intentName , and slots fields in the response. Consider the
       following examples:

       o If the message is to elicit slot data, Amazon Lex returns the follow-
         ing context information:

         o dialogState set to ElicitSlot

         o intentName set to the intent name in the current context

         o slotToElicit  set to the slot name for which the message is elicit-
           ing information

         o slots set to a map of slots, configured for the intent,  with  cur-
           rently known values

       o If  the  message  is a confirmation prompt, the dialogState is set to
         ConfirmIntent and SlotToElicit is set to null.

       o If the message is a clarification prompt (configured for the  intent)
         that indicates that user intent is not understood, the dialogState is
         set to ElicitIntent and slotToElicit is set to null.

       In addition, Amazon Lex also returns your application-specific session-
       Attributes . For more information, see Managing Conversation Context .

OPTIONS
       --bot-name (string)
          The name of the Amazon Lex bot.

       --bot-alias (string)
          The alias of the Amazon Lex bot.

       --user-id (string)
          The ID of the client application user. Amazon Lex uses this to iden-
          tify a user's conversation with your bot. At runtime,  each  request
          must contain the userID field.

          To decide the user ID to use for your application, consider the fol-
          lowing factors.

          o The userID field must not contain any personally identifiable  in-
            formation  of the user, for example, name, personal identification
            numbers, or other end user personal information.

          o If you want a user to start a conversation on one device and  con-
            tinue on another device, use a user-specific identifier.

          o If  you want the same user to be able to have two independent con-
            versations on two  different  devices,  choose  a  device-specific
            identifier.

          o A user can't have two independent conversations with two different
            versions of the same bot. For example, a user can't have a conver-
            sation with the PROD and BETA versions of the same bot. If you an-
            ticipate that a user will need to have conversation with two  dif-
            ferent versions, for example, while testing, include the bot alias
            in the user ID to separate the two conversations.

       --session-attributes (map)
          Application-specific information passed between  Amazon  Lex  and  a
          client application.

          For more information, see Setting Session Attributes .

            ...}

       --input-text (string)
          The text that the user entered (Amazon Lex interprets this text).

       --active-contexts (list)
          A  list  of  contexts active for the request. A context can be acti-
          vated when a previous intent is fulfilled, or by including the  con-
          text in the request,

          If  you  don't  specify  a list of contexts, Amazon Lex will use the
          current list of contexts for the session. If you  specify  an  empty
          list, all contexts for the session are cleared.

          (structure)
              A context is a variable that contains information about the cur-
              rent state of the conversation between a user  and  Amazon  Lex.
              Context can be set automatically by Amazon Lex when an intent is
              fulfilled, or it can be set at runtime using  the  PutContent  ,
              PutText , or PutSession operation.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the context.

              timeToLive -> (structure)
                 The  length of time or number of turns that a context remains
                 active.

                 timeToLiveInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The number of seconds that the context should  be  active
                     after  it  is first sent in a PostContent or PostText re-
                     sponse. You can set the value between 5 and  86,400  sec-
                     onds (24 hours).

                 turnsToLive -> (integer)
                     The  number of conversation turns that the context should
                     be active. A conversation  turn  is  one  PostContent  or
                     PostText request and the corresponding response from Ama-
                     zon Lex.

              parameters -> (map)
                 State variables for the current context. You  can  use  these
                 values as default values for slots in subsequent events.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,timeToLive={timeToLiveInSeconds=integer,turnsToLive=integer},parameters={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

            {
              "name": "string",
              "timeToLive": {
                "timeToLiveInSeconds": integer,
                "turnsToLive": integer
              },
              "parameters": {"string": "string"
                ...}
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       intentName -> (string)
          The current user intent that Amazon Lex is aware of.

       nluIntentConfidence -> (structure)
          Provides a score that indicates how confident Amazon Lex is that the
          returned intent is the one that matches the user's intent. The score
          is  between 0.0 and 1.0. For more information, see Confidence Scores
          .

          The score is a relative score, not an absolute score. The score  may
          change based on improvements to Amazon Lex.

          score -> (double)
              A  score  that indicates how confident Amazon Lex is that an in-
              tent satisfies the user's intent. Ranges between 0.00 and  1.00.
              Higher scores indicate higher confidence.

       alternativeIntents -> (list)
          One to four alternative intents that may be applicable to the user's
          intent.

          Each alternative includes a score that indicates how confident  Ama-
          zon  Lex  is  that the intent matches the user's intent. The intents
          are sorted by the confidence score.

          (structure)
              An intent that Amazon Lex suggests satisfies the user's  intent.
              Includes  the name of the intent, the confidence that Amazon Lex
              has that the user's intent is satisfied, and the  slots  defined
              for the intent.

              intentName -> (string)
                 The name of the intent that Amazon Lex suggests satisfies the
                 user's intent.

              nluIntentConfidence -> (structure)
                 Indicates how confident Amazon Lex is that an  intent  satis-
                 fies the user's intent.

                 score -> (double)
                     A  score  that indicates how confident Amazon Lex is that
                     an intent satisfies the  user's  intent.  Ranges  between
                     0.00 and 1.00. Higher scores indicate higher confidence.

              slots -> (map)
                 The  slot  and  slot values associated with the predicted in-
                 tent.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       slots -> (map)
          The intent slots that Amazon Lex detected from the user input in the
          conversation.

          Amazon  Lex creates a resolution list containing likely values for a
          slot. The value that it returns is determined by the valueSelection-
          Strategy selected when the slot type was created or updated. If val-
          ueSelectionStrategy is set to ORIGINAL_VALUE , the value provided by
          the  user is returned, if the user value is similar to the slot val-
          ues. If valueSelectionStrategy is set to TOP_RESOLUTION  Amazon  Lex
          returns  the  first  value in the resolution list or, if there is no
          resolution list, null. If you don't specify a valueSelectionStrategy
          , the default is ORIGINAL_VALUE .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       sessionAttributes -> (map)
          A  map  of key-value pairs representing the session-specific context
          information.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       message -> (string)
          The message to convey to the user. The message  can  come  from  the
          bot's configuration or from a Lambda function.

          If  the  intent  is not configured with a Lambda function, or if the
          Lambda function returned Delegate as the dialogAction.type  its  re-
          sponse,  Amazon Lex decides on the next course of action and selects
          an appropriate message from the bot's  configuration  based  on  the
          current  interaction  context. For example, if Amazon Lex isn't able
          to understand user input, it uses a clarification prompt message.

          When you create an intent you can assign messages  to  groups.  When
          messages  are assigned to groups Amazon Lex returns one message from
          each group in the response. The message field  is  an  escaped  JSON
          string  containing  the  messages.  For  more  information about the
          structure of the JSON string returned, see  msg-prompts-formats .

          If the Lambda function returns a message, Amazon Lex  passes  it  to
          the client in its response.

       sentimentResponse -> (structure)
          The sentiment expressed in and utterance.

          When  the  bot is configured to send utterances to Amazon Comprehend
          for sentiment analysis, this field contains the result of the analy-
          sis.

          sentimentLabel -> (string)
              The  inferred  sentiment  that Amazon Comprehend has the highest
              confidence in.

          sentimentScore -> (string)
              The likelihood that the sentiment was correctly inferred.

       messageFormat -> (string)
          The format of the response message. One of the following values:

          o PlainText - The message contains plain UTF-8 text.

          o CustomPayload - The message is a  custom  format  defined  by  the
            Lambda function.

          o SSML - The message contains text formatted for voice output.

          o Composite - The message contains an escaped JSON object containing
            one or more messages from the groups that messages  were  assigned
            to when the intent was created.

       dialogState -> (string)
          Identifies the current state of the user interaction. Amazon Lex re-
          turns one of the following values as dialogState .  The  client  can
          optionally use this information to customize the user interface.

          o ElicitIntent  - Amazon Lex wants to elicit user intent.  For exam-
            ple, a user might utter an intent ("I want to order a pizza").  If
            Amazon  Lex  cannot  infer the user intent from this utterance, it
            will return this dialogState.

          o ConfirmIntent - Amazon Lex is expecting a "yes" or "no"  response.
            For  example, Amazon Lex wants user confirmation before fulfilling
            an intent.  Instead of a simple "yes" or "no," a  user  might  re-
            spond  with additional information. For example, "yes, but make it
            thick crust pizza" or "no, I want to order a  drink".  Amazon  Lex
            can process such additional information (in these examples, update
            the crust type slot value, or change intent from OrderPizza to Or-
            derDrink).

          o ElicitSlot  - Amazon Lex is expecting a slot value for the current
            intent.  For example, suppose that  in  the  response  Amazon  Lex
            sends  this  message:  "What  size  pizza would you like?". A user
            might reply with the slot value (e.g., "medium"). The  user  might
            also provide additional information in the response (e.g., "medium
            thick crust pizza"). Amazon Lex can process such additional infor-
            mation appropriately.

          o Fulfilled  -  Conveys  that the Lambda function configured for the
            intent has successfully fulfilled the intent.

          o ReadyForFulfillment - Conveys that the client has to  fulfill  the
            intent.

          o Failed - Conveys that the conversation with the user failed.  This
            can happen for various reasons including that  the  user  did  not
            provide  an  appropriate response to prompts from the service (you
            can configure how many times Amazon Lex can prompt a user for spe-
            cific  information),  or the Lambda function failed to fulfill the
            intent.

       slotToElicit -> (string)
          If the dialogState value is ElicitSlot , returns  the  name  of  the
          slot for which Amazon Lex is eliciting a value.

       responseCard -> (structure)
          Represents  the  options that the user has to respond to the current
          prompt. Response Card can come from the bot  configuration  (in  the
          Amazon  Lex  console,  choose the settings button next to a slot) or
          from a code hook (Lambda function).

          version -> (string)
              The version of the response card format.

          contentType -> (string)
              The content type of the response.

          genericAttachments -> (list)
              An array of attachment objects representing options.

              (structure)
                 Represents an option rendered to the user when  a  prompt  is
                 shown. It could be an image, a button, a link, or text.

                 title -> (string)
                     The title of the option.

                 subTitle -> (string)
                     The subtitle shown below the title.

                 attachmentLinkUrl -> (string)
                     The URL of an attachment to the response card.

                 imageUrl -> (string)
                     The URL of an image that is displayed to the user.

                 buttons -> (list)
                     The list of options to show to the user.

                     (structure)
                        Represents  an  option to be shown on the client plat-
                        form (Facebook, Slack, etc.)

                        text -> (string)
                            Text that is visible to the user on the button.

                        value -> (string)
                            The value sent to Amazon Lex when a  user  chooses
                            the  button.  For  example,  consider  button text
                            "NYC." When the user chooses the button, the value
                            sent can be "New York City."

       sessionId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the session.

       botVersion -> (string)
          The  version  of the bot that responded to the conversation. You can
          use this information to help determine if one version of  a  bot  is
          performing better than another version.

       activeContexts -> (list)
          A list of active contexts for the session. A context can be set when
          an intent is fulfilled or by calling the PostContent , PostText , or
          PutSession operation.

          You  can  use a context to control the intents that can follow up an
          intent, or to modify the operation of your application.

          (structure)
              A context is a variable that contains information about the cur-
              rent  state  of  the conversation between a user and Amazon Lex.
              Context can be set automatically by Amazon Lex when an intent is
              fulfilled,  or  it  can be set at runtime using the PutContent ,
              PutText , or PutSession operation.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the context.

              timeToLive -> (structure)
                 The length of time or number of turns that a context  remains
                 active.

                 timeToLiveInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The  number  of seconds that the context should be active
                     after it is first sent in a PostContent or  PostText  re-
                     sponse.  You  can set the value between 5 and 86,400 sec-
                     onds (24 hours).

                 turnsToLive -> (integer)
                     The number of conversation turns that the context  should
                     be  active.  A  conversation  turn  is one PostContent or
                     PostText request and the corresponding response from Ama-
                     zon Lex.

              parameters -> (map)
                 State  variables  for  the current context. You can use these
                 values as default values for slots in subsequent events.
