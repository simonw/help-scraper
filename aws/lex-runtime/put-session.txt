              o Failed - The Lambda function associated with the intent failed
                to fulfill the intent.

              o Fulfilled  -  The  intent has fulfilled by the Lambda function
                associated with the intent.

              o ReadyForFulfillment - All of the information necessary for the
                intent  is present and the intent ready to be fulfilled by the
                client application.

          message -> (string)
              The message that should be shown to the user. If you don't spec-

       Shorthand Syntax:

          type=string,intentName=string,slots={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},slotToElicit=string,fulfillmentState=string,message=string,messageFormat=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "type": "ElicitIntent"|"ConfirmIntent"|"ElicitSlot"|"Close"|"Delegate",
            "intentName": "string",
            "slots": {"string": "string"
              ...},
            "slotToElicit": "string",
            "fulfillmentState": "Fulfilled"|"Failed"|"ReadyForFulfillment",
            "message": "string",
            "messageFormat": "PlainText"|"CustomPayload"|"SSML"|"Composite"
          }

       --recent-intent-summary-view (list)
          A summary of the recent intents for the bot. You can use the  intent
          summary  view  to set a checkpoint label on an intent and modify at-
          tributes of intents. You can also use it to  remove  or  add  intent
          summary objects to the list.

          An intent that you modify or add to the list must make sense for the
          bot. For example, the intent name must be valid  for  the  bot.  You
          must provide valid values for:

          o intentName

          o slot names

          o slotToElict

          If  you  send  the recentIntentSummaryView parameter in a PutSession
          request, the contents of the new summary view replaces the old  sum-
          mary  view.  For  example, if a GetSession request returns three in-
          tents in the summary view and you call PutSession with one intent in
          the  summary  view, the next call to GetSession will only return one
          intent.

          (structure)
              Provides information about the state of an intent. You  can  use
              this  information  to get the current state of an intent so that
              you can process the intent, or so that you can return the intent
              to its previous state.

              intentName -> (string)
                 The name of the intent.

              checkpointLabel -> (string)
                 A user-defined label that identifies a particular intent. You
                 can use this label to return to a previous intent.

                 Use the checkpointLabelFilter parameter of the  GetSessionRe-
                 quest  operation to filter the intents returned by the opera-
                 tion to those with only the specified label.

              slots -> (map)
                 Map of the slots that have been gathered and their values.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              confirmationStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the intent after the user responds to the  con-
                 firmation prompt. If the user confirms the intent, Amazon Lex
                 sets this field to Confirmed . If the user denies the intent,
                 Amazon  Lex  sets  this value to Denied . The possible values
                 are:

                 o Confirmed - The user has responded "Yes" to  the  confirma-
                   tion  prompt,  confirming  that  the intent is complete and
                   that it is ready to be fulfilled.

                 o Denied - The user has responded "No"  to  the  confirmation
                   prompt.

                 o None  -  The user has never been prompted for confirmation;
                   or, the user was prompted but did not confirm or  deny  the
                   prompt.

              dialogActionType -> (string)
                 The  next  action that the bot should take in its interaction
                 with the user. The possible values are:

                 o ConfirmIntent - The next action is asking the user  if  the
                   intent  is  complete  and  ready to be fulfilled. This is a
                   yes/no question such as "Place the order?"

                 o Close - Indicates that the there will  not  be  a  response
                   from  the  user. For example, the statement "Your order has
                   been placed" does not require a response.

                 o ElicitIntent - The next action is to determine  the  intent
                   that the user wants to fulfill.

                 o ElicitSlot - The next action is to elicit a slot value from
                   the user.

              fulfillmentState -> (string)
                 The fulfillment state of the intent. The possible values are:

                 o Failed - The Lambda function  associated  with  the  intent
                   failed to fulfill the intent.

                 o Fulfilled - The intent has fulfilled by the Lambda function
                   associated with the intent.

                 o ReadyForFulfillment - All of the information necessary  for
                   the  intent is present and the intent ready to be fulfilled
                   by the client application.

              slotToElicit -> (string)
                 The next slot to elicit from the user. If there is  not  slot
                 to elicit, the field is blank.

            }
            ...
          ]

       --accept (string)
          The  message  that  Amazon Lex returns in the response can be either
          text or speech based depending on the value of this field.

          o If the value is text/plain; charset=utf-8  ,  Amazon  Lex  returns
            text in the response.

          o If the value begins with audio/ , Amazon Lex returns speech in the
            response. Amazon Lex uses Amazon Polly to generate the  speech  in
            the  configuration  that  you specify. For example, if you specify
            audio/mpeg as the value, Amazon Lex returns  speech  in  the  MPEG
            format.

          o If the value is audio/pcm , the speech is returned as audio/pcm in
            16-bit, little endian format.

          o The following are the accepted values:

            o audio/mpeg

            o audio/ogg

            o text/plain; charset=utf-8

       --active-contexts (list)
          A list of contexts active for the request. A context  can  be  acti-
          vated  when a previous intent is fulfilled, or by including the con-
          text in the request,

          If you don't specify a list of contexts, Amazon  Lex  will  use  the
          current  list  of  contexts for the session. If you specify an empty
          list, all contexts for the session are cleared.

          (structure)
              A context is a variable that contains information about the cur-
              rent  state  of  the conversation between a user and Amazon Lex.
              Context can be set automatically by Amazon Lex when an intent is
              fulfilled,  or  it  can be set at runtime using the PutContent ,
              PutText , or PutSession operation.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the context.

              timeToLive -> (structure)
                 The length of time or number of turns that a context  remains
                 active.

                 timeToLiveInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The  number  of seconds that the context should be active
                     after it is first sent in a PostContent or  PostText  re-
                     sponse.  You  can set the value between 5 and 86,400 sec-
                     onds (24 hours).

                 turnsToLive -> (integer)
                     The number of conversation turns that the context  should
                     be  active.  A  conversation  turn  is one PostContent or
                     PostText request and the corresponding response from Ama-
                     zon Lex.

              parameters -> (map)
                 State  variables  for  the current context. You can use these
                 values as default values for slots in subsequent events.

OUTPUT
       contentType -> (string)
          Content type as specified in the Accept HTTP header in the request.

       intentName -> (string)
          The name of the current intent.

       slots -> (JSON)
          Map of zero or more intent slots Amazon Lex detected from  the  user
          input during the conversation.

          Amazon  Lex creates a resolution list containing likely values for a
          slot. The value that it returns is determined by the valueSelection-
          Strategy selected when the slot type was created or updated. If val-
          ueSelectionStrategy is set to ORIGINAL_VALUE , the value provided by
          the  user is returned, if the user value is similar to the slot val-
          ues. If valueSelectionStrategy is set to TOP_RESOLUTION  Amazon  Lex
          returns  the  first  value in the resolution list or, if there is no
          resolution list, null. If you don't specify a valueSelectionStrategy
          the default is ORIGINAL_VALUE .

            This  can  happen for various reasons, including the user does not
            provide an appropriate response to prompts from the service, or if
            the Lambda function fails to fulfill the intent.

          o Fulfilled  - Conveys that the Lambda function has sucessfully ful-
            filled the intent.

          o ReadyForFulfillment - Conveys that the client has to  fulfill  the
            intent.

       slotToElicit -> (string)
