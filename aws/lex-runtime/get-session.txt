OPTIONS
       --bot-name (string)
          The name of the bot that contains the session data.

       --bot-alias (string)
          The alias in use for the bot that contains the session data.

       --user-id (string)
          The ID of the client application user. Amazon Lex uses this to iden-
          tify a user's conversation with your bot.

       --checkpoint-label-filter (string)
          A string used to filter the intents returned in the recentIntentSum-
          maryView structure.

          When  you  specify a filter, only intents with their checkpointLabel
          field set to that string are returned.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       recentIntentSummaryView -> (list)
          An array of information about the intents used in the  session.  The
          array  can  contain a maximum of three summaries. If more than three
          intents are used in the session, the recentIntentSummaryView  opera-
          tion contains information about the last three intents used.

          If  you  set the checkpointLabelFilter parameter in the request, the
          array contains only the intents with the specified label.

          (structure)
              Provides information about the state of an intent. You  can  use
              this  information  to get the current state of an intent so that
              you can process the intent, or so that you can return the intent
              to its previous state.

              intentName -> (string)
                 The name of the intent.

              checkpointLabel -> (string)
                 A user-defined label that identifies a particular intent. You
                 can use this label to return to a previous intent.

                 Use the checkpointLabelFilter parameter of the  GetSessionRe-
                 quest  operation to filter the intents returned by the opera-
                 tion to those with only the specified label.

              slots -> (map)
                 Map of the slots that have been gathered and their values.

              confirmationStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the intent after the user responds to the  con-
                 firmation prompt. If the user confirms the intent, Amazon Lex
                 sets this field to Confirmed . If the user denies the intent,
                 Amazon  Lex  sets  this value to Denied . The possible values
                 are:

                 o Confirmed - The user has responded "Yes" to  the  confirma-
                   tion  prompt,  confirming  that  the intent is complete and

                 o Denied - The user has responded "No"  to  the  confirmation
                   prompt.

                 o None  -  The user has never been prompted for confirmation;
                   or, the user was prompted but did not confirm or  deny  the
                   prompt.

          intent, or to modify the operation of your application.

          (structure)
              A context is a variable that contains information about the cur-
              rent state of the conversation between a user  and  Amazon  Lex.
              Context can be set automatically by Amazon Lex when an intent is
              fulfilled, or it can be set at runtime using  the  PutContent  ,
              PutText , or PutSession operation.

                     zon Lex.

              parameters -> (map)
                 State variables for the current context. You  can  use  these
