DISCOVER-INPUT-SCHEMA()                                DISCOVER-INPUT-SCHEMA()



NAME
       discover-input-schema -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  documentation is for version 1 of the Amazon Kinesis Data Ana-
          lytics API, which only supports SQL applications. Version 2  of  the
          API  supports  SQL and Java applications. For more information about
          version 2, see Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API V2 Documentation .

       Infers a schema by evaluating sample records on the specified streaming
       source  (Amazon  Kinesis  stream  or  Amazon  Kinesis Firehose delivery
       stream) or S3 object. In the response, the operation  returns  the  in-
       ferred  schema  and  also the sample records that the operation used to
       infer the schema.

       You can use the inferred schema when configuring a streaming source for
       your  application. For conceptual information, see Configuring Applica-
       tion Input . Note that when you create an application using the  Amazon
       Kinesis  Analytics  console, the console uses this operation to infer a
       schema and show it in the console user interface.

       This operation  requires  permissions  to  perform  the  kinesisanalyt-
       ics:DiscoverInputSchema action.

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the streaming source.

       --role-arn (string)
          ARN  of the IAM role that Amazon Kinesis Analytics can assume to ac-
          cess the stream on your behalf.

       --input-starting-position-configuration (structure)
          Point at which you want Amazon Kinesis Analytics  to  start  reading
          records from the specified streaming source discovery purposes.

          InputStartingPosition -> (string)
              The starting position on the stream.

              o NOW  -  Start reading just after the most recent record in the
                stream, start at the request time stamp that the customer  is-
                sued.

              o TRIM_HORIZON  -  Start reading at the last untrimmed record in
                the stream, which  is  the  oldest  record  available  in  the
                stream.  This  option  is  not available for an Amazon Kinesis
                Firehose delivery stream.

              o LAST_STOPPED_POINT - Resume reading from where the application

          before discovering the schema of the records.

          InputLambdaProcessor -> (structure)

                 The ARN of the AWS Lambda function that operates  on  records
                 in the stream.

                 NOTE:
                     To specify an earlier version of the Lambda function than
                     the latest, include the Lambda function  version  in  the
                     Lambda  function  ARN.  For more information about Lambda
                     ARNs, see Example ARNs: AWS Lambda

              RoleARN -> (string)
                 The ARN of the IAM role that is used to access the AWS Lambda
                 function.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          InputLambdaProcessor={ResourceARN=string,RoleARN=string}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       InputSchema -> (structure)
          Schema inferred from the streaming source. It identifies the  format
          of  the  data in the streaming source and how each data element maps
          to corresponding columns in the in-application stream that  you  can
          create.

          RecordFormat -> (structure)
              Specifies the format of the records on the streaming source.

              RecordFormatType -> (string)
                 The type of record format.

              MappingParameters -> (structure)
                 When configuring application input at the time of creating or
                 updating an application, provides additional mapping informa-
                 tion  specific  to  the  record format (such as JSON, CSV, or
                 record fields delimited by some delimiter) on  the  streaming
                 source.

                 JSONMappingParameters -> (structure)
                     Provides  additional mapping information when JSON is the
                     record format on the streaming source.

                     RecordRowPath -> (string)
                        Path  to  the  top-level  parent  that  contains   the
                        records.

                 CSVMappingParameters -> (structure)
                     Provides  additional  mapping information when the record

                     RecordRowDelimiter -> (string)
                        Row delimiter. For example, in a CSV  format,  'n'  is

                     RecordColumnDelimiter -> (string)
                        Column  delimiter.  For  example,  in  a CSV format, a
                        comma (",") is the typical column delimiter.

          RecordEncoding -> (string)
              Specifies the encoding of the records in the  streaming  source.
              For example, UTF-8.

              A list of RecordColumn objects.

              (structure)

                 Mapping -> (string)
                     Reference  to  the data element in the streaming input or
                     the reference data source. This element  is  required  if
                     the RecordFormatType is JSON .

                 SqlType -> (string)
                     Type of column created in the in-application input stream
