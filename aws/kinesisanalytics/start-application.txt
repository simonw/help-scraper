       start-application -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  documentation is for version 1 of the Amazon Kinesis Data Ana-
          lytics API, which only supports SQL applications. Version 2  of  the
          API  supports  SQL and Java applications. For more information about
          version 2, see Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API V2 Documentation .

       Starts the specified Amazon Kinesis Analytics application. After creat-
       ing  an  application, you must exclusively call this operation to start
       your application.

       After the application starts, it begins consuming the input data,  pro-
       cesses it, and writes the output to the configured destination.

       The  application  status must be READY for you to start an application.
       You can get  the  application  status  in  the  console  or  using  the
       DescribeApplication operation.

       After you start the application, you can stop the application from pro-
       cessing the input by calling the StopApplication operation.

       This operation  requires  permissions  to  perform  the  kinesisanalyt-
       ics:StartApplication action.

SYNOPSIS
            start-application
          --application-name <value>
          --input-configurations <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          Name of the application.

       --input-configurations (list)
          Identifies  the  specific  input, by ID, that the application starts
          consuming. Amazon Kinesis Analytics  starts  reading  the  streaming
          source  associated with the input. You can also specify where in the
          streaming source you want Amazon Kinesis Analytics to start reading.

          (structure)
              When you start your application, you provide this configuration,
              which  identifies  the  input  source and the point in the input
              source at which you want the  application  to  start  processing
              records.

              Id -> (string)
                 Input  source  ID.  You  can  get  this  ID  by  calling  the
                 DescribeApplication operation.

              InputStartingPositionConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Point at which you want the application to  start  processing
                 records from the streaming source.

                 InputStartingPosition -> (string)
                     The starting position on the stream.

                     o NOW  -  Start reading just after the most recent record
                       in the stream, start at the request time stamp that the
                       customer issued.

                     o TRIM_HORIZON  -  Start  reading  at  the last untrimmed
                       record in the stream, which is the oldest record avail-
                       able in the stream. This option is not available for an
                       Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery stream.

                     o LAST_STOPPED_POINT - Resume reading from where the  ap-
                       plication last stopped reading.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Id=string,InputStartingPositionConfiguration={InputStartingPosition=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Id": "string",
              "InputStartingPositionConfiguration": {
                "InputStartingPosition": "NOW"|"TRIM_HORIZON"|"LAST_STOPPED_POINT"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
