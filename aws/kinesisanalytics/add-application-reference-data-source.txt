DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  documentation is for version 1 of the Amazon Kinesis Data Ana-
          lytics API, which only supports SQL applications. Version 2  of  the
          API  supports  SQL and Java applications. For more information about
          version 2, see Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API V2 Documentation .

       Adds a reference data source to an existing application.

       Amazon Kinesis Analytics reads reference data (that is,  an  Amazon  S3
       object) and creates an in-application table within your application. In
       the request, you provide the source (S3  bucket  name  and  object  key
       name),  name  of  the in-application table to create, and the necessary
       mapping information that describes how data in Amazon S3 object maps to
       columns in the resulting in-application table.

       For conceptual information, see Configuring Application Input . For the
       limits on data sources you can add to your application, see Limits .

       This operation requires permissions to perform the kinesisanalytics:Ad-
       dApplicationOutput action.

SYNOPSIS
            add-application-reference-data-source
          --application-name <value>
          --current-application-version-id <value>
          --reference-data-source <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          Name of an existing application.

       --current-application-version-id (long)
          Version  of  the  application for which you are adding the reference
          data source. You can use the DescribeApplication  operation  to  get
          the current application version. If the version specified is not the
          current version, the ConcurrentModificationException is returned.

       --reference-data-source (structure)
          The reference data source can be an object in your Amazon S3 bucket.
          Amazon  Kinesis  Analytics reads the object and copies the data into
          the in-application table that is created. You provide an S3  bucket,
          object key name, and the resulting in-application table that is cre-
          ated. You must also provide an IAM role with the  necessary  permis-
          sions  that  Amazon  Kinesis Analytics can assume to read the object
          from your S3 bucket on your behalf.

          TableName -> (string)
              Name of the in-application table to create.

          S3ReferenceDataSource -> (structure)
              Identifies the S3 bucket and object that contains the  reference
              data.  Also identifies the IAM role Amazon Kinesis Analytics can
              assume to read this object on your behalf. An Amazon Kinesis An-
              alytics  application loads reference data only once. If the data
              changes, you call the  UpdateApplication  operation  to  trigger
              reloading of data into your application.

              BucketARN -> (string)
                 Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the S3 bucket.

              FileKey -> (string)
                 Object key name containing reference data.

              ReferenceRoleARN -> (string)
                 ARN  of the IAM role that the service can assume to read data
                 on your behalf.  This  role  must  have  permission  for  the
                 s3:GetObject  action  on the object and trust policy that al-
                 lows Amazon Kinesis Analytics  service  principal  to  assume
                 this role.

          ReferenceSchema -> (structure)
              Describes  the  format  of the data in the streaming source, and
              how each data element maps to corresponding columns  created  in
              the in-application stream.

              RecordFormat -> (structure)
                 Specifies the format of the records on the streaming source.

                 RecordFormatType -> (string)
                     The type of record format.

                 MappingParameters -> (structure)
                     When  configuring application input at the time of creat-
                     ing or updating an application, provides additional  map-
                     ping  information  specific to the record format (such as
                     JSON, CSV, or record fields delimited by some  delimiter)
                     on the streaming source.

                     JSONMappingParameters -> (structure)
                        Provides  additional  mapping information when JSON is
                        the record format on the streaming source.

                        RecordRowPath -> (string)
                            Path to the top-level  parent  that  contains  the
                            records.

                     CSVMappingParameters -> (structure)
                        Provides   additional  mapping  information  when  the
                        record format uses delimiters (for example, CSV).

                        RecordRowDelimiter -> (string)
                            Row delimiter. For example, in a CSV  format,  'n'
                            is the typical row delimiter.

                        RecordColumnDelimiter -> (string)
                            Column  delimiter. For example, in a CSV format, a
                            comma (",") is the typical column delimiter.

              RecordEncoding -> (string)
                 Specifies the  encoding  of  the  records  in  the  streaming
                 source. For example, UTF-8.

              RecordColumns -> (list)
                 A list of RecordColumn objects.

                 (structure)
                     Describes the mapping of each data element in the stream-
                     ing source to the corresponding column in the in-applica-
                     tion stream.

                     Also  used  to  describe the format of the reference data
                     source.

                     Name -> (string)
                        Name of the column created in the in-application input
                        stream or reference table.

                     Mapping -> (string)
                        Reference  to  the data element in the streaming input
                        or the reference data source. This element is required
                        if the RecordFormatType is JSON .

                     SqlType -> (string)
                        Type  of  column  created  in the in-application input
                        stream or reference table.

                  "Name": "string",
                  "Mapping": "string",
                  "SqlType": "string"
                }
                ...
              ]
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
