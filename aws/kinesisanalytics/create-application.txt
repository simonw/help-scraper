CREATE-APPLICATION()                                      CREATE-APPLICATION()



NAME
       create-application -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  documentation is for version 1 of the Amazon Kinesis Data Ana-
          lytics API, which only supports SQL applications. Version 2  of  the
          API  supports  SQL and Java applications. For more information about
          version 2, see Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API V2 Documentation .

       Creates an Amazon Kinesis Analytics application. You can configure each
       application  with  one  streaming  source as input, application code to
       process the input, and up to three destinations where you  want  Amazon
       Kinesis  Analytics  to write the output data from your application. For
       an overview, see How it Works .

       In the input configuration, you map the streaming source to  an  in-ap-
       plication  stream,  which you can think of as a constantly updating ta-
       ble. In the mapping, you must provide a schema for  the  in-application
       stream  and map each data column in the in-application stream to a data
       element in the streaming source.

       Your application code is one or more SQL  statements  that  read  input
       data, transform it, and generate output. Your application code can cre-
       ate one or more SQL artifacts like SQL streams or pumps.

       In the output configuration, you can configure the application to write
       data  from in-application streams created in your applications to up to
       three destinations.

       To read data from your source  stream  or  write  data  to  destination
       streams,  Amazon  Kinesis  Analytics  needs your permissions. You grant
       these permissions by creating IAM roles. This operation  requires  per-
       missions to perform the kinesisanalytics:CreateApplication action.

       cation, see Getting Started .

SYNOPSIS
            create-application
          --application-name <value>
          [--application-description <value>]
          [--inputs <value>]
          [--outputs <value>]
          [--cloud-watch-logging-options <value>]
          [--application-code <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          Name of your Amazon Kinesis Analytics application (for example, sam-
          ple-app ).

       --application-description (string)
          Summary description of the application.

       --inputs (list)
          Use this parameter to configure the application input.

          You  can  configure  your application to receive input from a single
          streaming source. In this  configuration,  you  map  this  streaming
          source to an in-application stream that is created. Your application
          code can then query the in-application stream like a table (you  can
          think of it as a constantly updating table).

          For the streaming source, you provide its Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
          and format of data on the stream (for example, JSON, CSV, etc.). You
          also  must provide an IAM role that Amazon Kinesis Analytics can as-
          sume to read this stream on your behalf.

          To create the in-application stream, you need to specify a schema to
          transform  your  data into a schematized version used in SQL. In the
          schema, you provide the necessary mapping of the  data  elements  in
          the streaming source to record columns in the in-app stream.

          (structure)
              When  you  configure  the  application  input,  you  specify the
              streaming source, the in-application stream name  that  is  cre-
              ated, and the mapping between the two. For more information, see
              Configuring Application Input .

              NamePrefix -> (string)
                 Name prefix to use when creating  an  in-application  stream.
                 Suppose  that  you  specify a prefix "MyInApplicationStream."
                 Amazon Kinesis Analytics then creates one or more (as per the
                 InputParallelism  count you specified) in-application streams
                 with  names  "MyInApplicationStream_001,"   "MyInApplication-
                 Stream_002," and so on.

              InputProcessingConfiguration -> (structure)

                 cessor transforms records  as  they  are  received  from  the
                 stream,  before  the  application's  SQL  code executes. Cur-
                 rently, the only input processing configuration available  is
                 InputLambdaProcessor .

                 InputLambdaProcessor -> (structure)
                     The  InputLambdaProcessor  that is used to preprocess the
                     records in the stream before being processed by your  ap-
                     plication code.

                     ResourceARN -> (string)

                        records in the stream.

                        NOTE:
                            To specify an earlier version of the Lambda  func-
                            tion  than the latest, include the Lambda function
                            version in the Lambda function ARN. For  more  in-
                            formation about Lambda ARNs, see Example ARNs: AWS

          vide  an  IAM role that Amazon Kinesis Analytics can assume to write
          to the destination stream or Lambda function on your behalf.

          In the output configuration, you also provide the output  stream  or
          Lambda function ARN. For stream destinations, you provide the format
          of data in the stream (for example, JSON, CSV). You also  must  pro-
          vide  an  IAM role that Amazon Kinesis Analytics can assume to write

       --cloud-watch-logging-options (list)
          Use  this  parameter to configure a CloudWatch log stream to monitor
          application configuration errors. For more information, see  Working
          with Amazon CloudWatch Logs .

          (structure)
              Provides  a description of CloudWatch logging options, including
              the log stream Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and the role ARN.

              LogStreamARN -> (string)
                 ARN of the CloudWatch log to receive application messages.

              RoleARN -> (string)
                 IAM ARN of the role to  use  to  send  application  messages.
                 Note:  To  write  application messages to CloudWatch, the IAM
                 role that is used must have the  PutLogEvents  policy  action
                 enabled.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          LogStreamARN=string,RoleARN=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "LogStreamARN": "string",
              "RoleARN": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --application-code (string)
          One  or  more SQL statements that read input data, transform it, and
          generate output. For example, you can write  a  SQL  statement  that
          reads data from one in-application stream, generates a running aver-
          age of the number of advertisement clicks by vendor, and insert  re-
          sulting  rows in another in-application stream using pumps. For more
          information about the typical pattern, see Application Code .

          You can provide such series of SQL statements, where output  of  one
          statement can be used as the input for the next statement. You store
          intermediate results by creating in-application streams and pumps.

          Note that the application code must create the  streams  with  names
          specified in the Outputs . For example, if your Outputs defines out-
          put streams named ExampleOutputStream1  and  ExampleOutputStream2  ,
          then your application code must create these streams.

       --tags (list)
          A  list of one or more tags to assign to the application. A tag is a
          key-value pair that identifies an application. Note that the maximum
          number  of application tags includes system tags. The maximum number
          of user-defined application tags is 50. For  more  information,  see
          Using Tagging .

          (structure)
              A key-value pair (the value is optional) that you can define and
              assign to AWS resources. If you specify a tag that  already  ex-
              ists,  the tag value is replaced with the value that you specify
              in the request. Note that the maximum number of application tags
              includes  system tags. The maximum number of user-defined appli-
              cation tags is 50. For more information, see Using Tagging .

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the key-value tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the key-value tag. The value is optional.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ApplicationSummary -> (structure)
          In  response  to your CreateApplication request, Amazon Kinesis Ana-

          ated,  including  the  application Amazon Resource Name (ARN), name,
          and status.

          ApplicationName -> (string)
              Name of the application.

          ApplicationARN -> (string)
