ADD-APPLICATION-INPUT()                                ADD-APPLICATION-INPUT()



NAME
       add-application-input -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  documentation is for version 1 of the Amazon Kinesis Data Ana-
          lytics API, which only supports SQL applications. Version 2  of  the
          API  supports  SQL and Java applications. For more information about
          version 2, see Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API V2 Documentation .

       Adds a streaming source to your Amazon Kinesis application. For concep-
       tual information, see Configuring Application Input .

       You can add a streaming source either when you create an application or
       you can use this operation to add a streaming source after  you  create
       an application. For more information, see CreateApplication .

       Any  configuration  update,  including  adding a streaming source using
       this operation, results in a new version of the  application.  You  can
       use  the  DescribeApplication operation to find the current application
       version.

       This operation requires permissions to perform the kinesisanalytics:Ad-
       dApplicationInput action.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            add-application-input
          --application-name <value>
          --current-application-version-id <value>
          --input <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          Name  of your existing Amazon Kinesis Analytics application to which
          you want to add the streaming source.

       --current-application-version-id (long)
          Current version of your Amazon Kinesis  Analytics  application.  You
          can use the DescribeApplication operation to find the current appli-
          cation version.

       --input (structure)
          The Input to add.

          NamePrefix -> (string)
              Name prefix to use when creating an in-application stream.  Sup-
              pose  that  you specify a prefix "MyInApplicationStream." Amazon
              Kinesis Analytics then creates one or more (as per the InputPar-
              allelism  count you specified) in-application streams with names
              "MyInApplicationStream_001," "MyInApplicationStream_002," and so
              on.

          InputProcessingConfiguration -> (structure)
              The InputProcessingConfiguration for the input. An input proces-
              sor transforms records as they are received from the stream, be-
              fore  the  application's  SQL code executes. Currently, the only
              input processing configuration available is InputLambdaProcessor
              .

              InputLambdaProcessor -> (structure)
                 The  InputLambdaProcessor  that  is  used  to  preprocess the
                 records in the stream before being processed by your applica-
                 tion code.

                 ResourceARN -> (string)
                     The  ARN  of  the  AWS  Lambda  function that operates on
                     records in the stream.

                     NOTE:
                        To specify an earlier version of the  Lambda  function
                        than  the  latest, include the Lambda function version
                        in the Lambda function ARN. For more information about
                        Lambda ARNs, see Example ARNs: AWS Lambda

                 RoleARN -> (string)
                     The  ARN  of  the IAM role that is used to access the AWS
                     Lambda function.

          KinesisStreamsInput -> (structure)
              If the streaming source is an Amazon Kinesis stream,  identifies
              the stream's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and an IAM role that en-
              ables Amazon Kinesis Analytics to access the stream on your  be-
              half.

              Note:  Either KinesisStreamsInput or KinesisFirehoseInput is re-
              quired.

              ResourceARN -> (string)
                 ARN of the input Amazon Kinesis stream to read.

              RoleARN -> (string)
                 ARN of the IAM role that Amazon Kinesis Analytics can  assume
                 to  access  the  stream on your behalf. You need to grant the
                 necessary permissions to this role.

          KinesisFirehoseInput -> (structure)
              If the streaming source is an Amazon Kinesis  Firehose  delivery
              stream,  identifies  the  delivery  stream's ARN and an IAM role
              that enables Amazon Kinesis Analytics to access  the  stream  on
              your behalf.

              RoleARN -> (string)
                 ARN of the IAM role that Amazon Kinesis Analytics can  assume
                 to  access  the  stream on your behalf. You need to make sure
                 that the role has the necessary  permissions  to  access  the
                 stream.

          InputParallelism -> (structure)
              Describes the number of in-application streams to create.

              Describes  the  format  of the data in the streaming source, and
              how each data element  maps  to  corresponding  columns  in  the
              in-application stream that is being created.

              Also used to describe the format of the reference data source.

              RecordFormat -> (structure)
                 Specifies the format of the records on the streaming source.

                 RecordFormatType -> (string)

                     When  configuring application input at the time of creat-
                     ing or updating an application, provides additional  map-
                     ping  information  specific to the record format (such as
                     JSON, CSV, or record fields delimited by some  delimiter)
                     on the streaming source.

                     JSONMappingParameters -> (structure)
                        Provides  additional  mapping information when JSON is

                        RecordRowPath -> (string)
                            Path to the top-level  parent  that  contains  the
                            records.

                     CSVMappingParameters -> (structure)
                        Provides   additional  mapping  information  when  the

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
