DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  documentation is for version 1 of the Amazon Kinesis Data Ana-
          lytics API, which only supports SQL applications. Version 2  of  the
          API  supports  SQL and Java applications. For more information about
          version 2, see Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API V2 Documentation .

       Returns a list of Amazon Kinesis Analytics  applications  in  your  ac-
       count.  For  each  application,  the  response includes the application
       name, Amazon Resource Name (ARN), and status. If the  response  returns
       the  HasMoreApplications value as true, you can send another request by
       adding the ExclusiveStartApplicationName in the request body,  and  set
       the  value  of  this to the last application name from the previous re-
       sponse.

       If you want detailed information  about  a  specific  application,  use
       DescribeApplication .

       This  operation  requires  permissions  to  perform  the kinesisanalyt-
       ics:ListApplications action.

SYNOPSIS
            list-applications
          [--limit <value>]
          [--exclusive-start-application-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --limit (integer)
          Maximum number of applications to list.

       --exclusive-start-application-name (string)
          Name of the application to start the list with. When  using  pagina-
          tion  to retrieve the list, you don't need to specify this parameter
          in the first request. However, in subsequent requests, you  add  the
          last  application  name  from  the previous response to get the next
          page of applications.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ApplicationSummaries -> (list)
          List of ApplicationSummary objects.
