DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  documentation is for version 1 of the Amazon Kinesis Data Ana-
          lytics API, which only supports SQL applications. Version 2  of  the
          API  supports  SQL and Java applications. For more information about
          version 2, see Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API V2 Documentation .

       Updates an existing Amazon Kinesis Analytics  application.  Using  this
       API,  you  can update application code, input configuration, and output
       configuration.

       Note that Amazon Kinesis Analytics updates  the  CurrentApplicationVer-
       sionId each time you update your application.

       This  operation  requires permission for the kinesisanalytics:UpdateAp-
       plication action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                               Provides  additional  mapping  information when
                               the record format uses delimiters (for example,
                               CSV).

                               RecordRowDelimiter -> (string)
                                   Row  delimiter.  For example, in a CSV for-
                                   mat, 'n' is the typical row delimiter.

                               RecordColumnDelimiter -> (string)
                                   Column delimiter. For  example,  in  a  CSV
                                   format, a comma (",") is the typical column
                                   delimiter.

                     RecordEncoding -> (string)
                        Specifies the encoding of the records in the streaming
                        source. For example, UTF-8.

                     RecordColumns -> (list)
                        A list of RecordColumn objects.

                        (structure)
                            Describes  the mapping of each data element in the
                            streaming source to the  corresponding  column  in
                            the in-application stream.

                            Also  used to describe the format of the reference
                            data source.

                            Name -> (string)
                               Name of the column created in  the  in-applica-
                               tion input stream or reference table.

                            Mapping -> (string)
                               Reference  to the data element in the streaming
                               input or the reference data source.  This  ele-
                               ment  is  required  if  the RecordFormatType is
                               JSON .

                            SqlType -> (string)
                               Type of column created  in  the  in-application
                               input stream or reference table.

          CloudWatchLoggingOptionUpdates -> (list)
              Describes application CloudWatch logging option updates.

              (structure)
                 Describes CloudWatch logging option updates.

                 CloudWatchLoggingOptionId -> (string)
                     ID of the CloudWatch logging option to update

                 LogStreamARNUpdate -> (string)
                     ARN  of  the  CloudWatch  log to receive application mes-
                     sages.

                 RoleARNUpdate -> (string)
                     IAM ARN of the role to use to send application  messages.
                     Note:  To  write  application messages to CloudWatch, the
                     IAM role used must have the  PutLogEvents  policy  action
                     enabled.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
