NAME
       describe-scheduling-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes one or more of your scheduling policies.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-scheduling-policies
          --arns <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arns (list)
          A list of up to 100 scheduling policy Amazon Resource Name (ARN) en-
          tries.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       schedulingPolicies -> (list)
          The list of scheduling policies.

          (structure)
              An object that represents a scheduling policy.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the scheduling policy.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the scheduling  policy.  An
                 example is
                 ``
                 arn:aws   :batch:us-east-1   :123456789012   :scheduling-pol-
                 icy/HighPriority `` .

              fairsharePolicy -> (structure)
                 The fair share policy for the scheduling policy.

                 shareDecaySeconds -> (integer)
                     The time period to use to calculate a fair share percent-
                     age  for each fair share identifier in use, in seconds. A
                     value of zero  (0)  indicates  that  only  current  usage
                     should  be  measured.  The decay allows for more recently
                     run jobs to have more weight than jobs that ran  earlier.
                     The maximum supported value is 604800 (1 week).

                 computeReservation -> (integer)
                     A  value  used  to  reserve some of the available maximum
                     vCPU for fair share identifiers that have  not  yet  been
                     used.

                     The reserved ratio is
                     ``
                     (computeReservation  /100)^*ActiveFairShares* `` where ``
                     ActiveFairShares `` is the number of  active  fair  share
                     identifiers.

                     For  example,  a computeReservation value of 50 indicates
                     that Batch should reserve 50% of  the  maximum  available
                     vCPU  if  there is only one fair share identifier, 25% if
                     there are two fair share identifiers, and 12.5% if  there
                     are  three  fair  share identifiers. A computeReservation
                     value of 25 indicates that Batch should  reserve  25%  of
                     the  maximum  available  vCPU  if  there is only one fair
                     share identifier, 6.25% if there are two fair share iden-
                     tifiers,  and 1.56% if there are three fair share identi-
                     fiers.

                     The minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 99.

                 shareDistribution -> (list)
                     An array of SharedIdentifier  objects  that  contain  the
                     weights for the fair share identifiers for the fair share
                     policy. Fair share identifiers that aren't included  have
                     a default weight of 1.0 .

                     (structure)
                        Specifies  the  weights for the fair share identifiers
                        for the fair share policy. Fair share identifiers that
                        aren't included have a default weight of 1.0 .

                        shareIdentifier -> (string)
                            A  fair  share identifier or fair share identifier
                            prefix. If the string ends with an  asterisk  (*),
                            this  entry specifies the weight factor to use for
                            fair share identifiers that start with  that  pre-
                            fix.  The list of fair share identifiers in a fair
                            share policy  cannot  overlap.  For  example,  you
                            can't have one that specifies a shareIdentifier of
                            UserA* and another that specifies  a  shareIdenti-
                            fier of UserA-1 .

                            There  can  be no more than 500 fair share identi-
                            fiers active in a job queue.

                            The string is limited to 255 alphanumeric  charac-
                            ters, optionally followed by an asterisk (*).

                        weightFactor -> (float)
                            The  weight  factor for the fair share identifier.
                            The default value is 1.0.  A  lower  value  has  a
                            higher  priority  for compute resources. For exam-
                            ple, jobs that  use  a  share  identifier  with  a
                            weight  factor of 0.125 (1/8) get 8 times the com-
                            pute resources of jobs that use a share identifier
                            with a weight factor of 1.

                            The  smallest  supported  value is 0.0001, and the
                            largest supported value is 999.9999.

              tags -> (map)
                 The tags that you apply to the scheduling policy  to  catego-
                 rize  and organize your resources. Each tag consists of a key
                 and an optional value. For more information, see Tagging Ama-

                 Reference .
