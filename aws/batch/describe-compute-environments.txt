NAME
       describe-compute-environments -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes one or more of your compute environments.

       If  you're  using an unmanaged compute environment, you can use the De-
       scribeComputeEnvironment operation to determine the ecsClusterArn  that
       you should launch your Amazon ECS container instances into.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-compute-environments  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: computeEnvironments

SYNOPSIS
            describe-compute-environments
          [--compute-environments <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --compute-environments (list)
          A list of up to 100 compute environment names  or  full  Amazon  Re-
          source Name (ARN) entries.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       computeEnvironments -> (list)
          The list of compute environments.

          (structure)
              An object representing an Batch compute environment.

              computeEnvironmentName -> (string)
                 The name of the compute environment. It can be up to 128 let-
                 ters  long.  It  can contain uppercase and lowercase letters,
                 numbers, hyphens (-), and underscores (_).

              computeEnvironmentArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the compute environment.

              unmanagedvCpus -> (integer)
                 The maximum number of VCPUs expected to be used for an unman-
                 aged compute environment.

              ecsClusterArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the underlying Amazon ECS
                 cluster used by the compute environment.

              tags -> (map)
                 The tags applied to the compute environment.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              type -> (string)
                 The type of the compute environment: MANAGED or  UNMANAGED  .
                 For  more  information, see Compute Environments in the Batch
                 User Guide .

              state -> (string)
                 The state of the compute environment. The  valid  values  are
                 ENABLED or DISABLED .

                 If  the  state  is ENABLED , then the Batch scheduler can at-
                 tempt to place jobs from an associated job queue on the  com-
                 pute  resources  within the environment. If the compute envi-
                 ronment is managed, then it can scale its instances out or in
                 automatically, based on the job queue demand.

                 If  the  state is DISABLED , then the Batch scheduler doesn't
                 attempt to place jobs  within  the  environment.  Jobs  in  a
                 STARTING or RUNNING state continue to progress normally. Man-
                 aged compute environments in the DISABLED state  don't  scale
                 out. However, they scale in to minvCpus value after instances
                 become idle.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status of the compute environment  (for  example,
                 CREATING or VALID ).

              statusReason -> (string)
                 A  short, human-readable string to provide additional details
                 about the current status of the compute environment.

              computeResources -> (structure)
                 The compute resources defined for  the  compute  environment.
                 For  more  information, see Compute Environments in the Batch
                 User Guide .

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of compute environment: EC2 , SPOT ,  FARGATE  ,
                     or FARGATE_SPOT . For more information, see Compute Envi-
                     ronments in the Batch User Guide .

                     If you choose SPOT , you must also specify an Amazon  EC2
                     Spot  Fleet role with the spotIamFleetRole parameter. For
                     more information, see Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet role  in  the
                     Batch User Guide .

                 allocationStrategy -> (string)
                     The  allocation  strategy to use for the compute resource
                     if not enough instances of the best fitting instance type
                     can  be  allocated. This might be because of availability
                     of the instance type in the Region or Amazon EC2  service
                     limits  . For more information, see Allocation Strategies
                     in the Batch User Guide .

                     NOTE:
                        This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are  run-
                        ning on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

                        BEST_FIT (default)

                     Batch  selects  an instance type that best fits the needs
                     of the jobs with a preference  for  the  lowest-cost  in-
                     stance  type. If additional instances of the selected in-
                     stance type aren't available, Batch waits for  the  addi-
                     tional  instances to be available. If there aren't enough
                     instances available, or if the user  is  reaching  Amazon
                     EC2  service limits then additional jobs aren't run until
                     the currently running jobs have completed.  This  alloca-
                     tion strategy keeps costs lower but can limit scaling. If
                     you are using Spot Fleets with  BEST_FIT  then  the  Spot
                     Fleet IAM Role must be specified.
                        BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE

                     Batch  will  select  additional  instance  types that are
                     large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in  the
                     queue,  with a preference for instance types with a lower
                     cost per unit vCPU. If additional instances of the previ-
                     ously  selected  instance  types  aren't available, Batch
                     will select new instance types.
                        SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED

                     Batch will select one or more  instance  types  that  are
                     large  enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the
                     queue, with a preference for instance types that are less
                     likely  to  be  interrupted.  This allocation strategy is
                     only available for Spot Instance compute resources.

                     With both  BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE  and  SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTI-
                     MIZED  strategies,  Batch might need to go above maxvCpus
                     to meet your capacity requirements. In this event,  Batch
                     never exceeds maxvCpus by more than a single instance.

                 minvCpus -> (integer)
                     The  minimum  number of Amazon EC2 vCPUs that an environ-
                     ment should maintain (even if the compute environment  is
                     DISABLED ).

                     NOTE:
                        This  parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are run-
                        ning on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

                 maxvCpus -> (integer)
                     The maximum number of Amazon EC2 vCPUs that a compute en-
                     vironment can reach.

                     NOTE:
                        With both BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE and SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTI-
                        MIZED allocation strategies, Batch might need  to  ex-
                        ceed  maxvCpus  to meet your capacity requirements. In
                        this event, Batch never exceeds maxvCpus by more  than
                        a  single instance. For example, no more than a single
                        instance from among those specified  in  your  compute
                        environment is allocated.

                 desiredvCpus -> (integer)
                     The desired number of Amazon EC2 vCPUS in the compute en-
                     vironment. Batch modifies this value between the  minimum
                     and maximum values, based on job queue demand.

                     NOTE:
                        This  parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are run-
                        ning on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

                 instanceTypes -> (list)
                     The instances types that can be launched. You can specify
                     instance  families  to  launch  any  instance type within
                     those families (for example, c5 or p3 ), or you can spec-
                     ify specific sizes within a family (such as c5.8xlarge ).
                     You can also choose  optimal  to  select  instance  types
                     (from  the  C4,  M4, and R4 instance families) that match
                     the demand of your job queues.

                     NOTE:
                        This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are  run-
                        ning on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

                     NOTE:
                        When  you  create  a compute environment, the instance
                        types that you select for the compute environment must
                        share  the  same  architecture. For example, you can't
                        mix x86 and ARM instances in the same compute environ-
                        ment.

                     NOTE:
                        Currently,  optimal  uses  instance types from the C4,
                        M4, and R4 instance families. In  Regions  that  don't
                        have  instance types from those instance families, in-
                        stance types from the C5, M5. and R5 instance families
                        are used.

                     (string)

                 imageId -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Machine  Image  (AMI)  ID used for instances
                     launched in the compute environment.  This  parameter  is
                     overridden  by  the imageIdOverride member of the Ec2Con-
                     figuration structure.

                     NOTE:
                        This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are  run-
                        ning on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

                     NOTE:
                        The AMI that you choose for a compute environment must
                        match the architecture of the instance types that  you
                        intend  to use for that compute environment. For exam-
                        ple, if your  compute  environment  uses  A1  instance
                        types,  the  compute resource AMI that you choose must
                        support ARM instances. Amazon ECS vends both  x86  and
                        ARM  versions of the Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux
                        2 AMI. For more information, see Amazon  ECS-optimized
                        Amazon  Linux  2  AMI  in the Amazon Elastic Container
                        Service Developer Guide .

                 subnets -> (list)
                     The VPC subnets where the compute resources are launched.
                     These  subnets  must be within the same VPC. Fargate com-
                     pute resources can contain up to 16 subnets. For more in-
                     formation,  see  VPCs  and Subnets in the Amazon VPC User
                     Guide .

                     (string)

                 securityGroupIds -> (list)
                     The Amazon EC2 security groups associated with  instances
                     launched in the compute environment. One or more security
                     groups must be specified, either in  securityGroupIds  or
                     using  a  launch  template referenced in launchTemplate .
                     This parameter is required for jobs that are  running  on
                     Fargate  resources and must contain at least one security
                     group. Fargate doesn't support launch templates. If secu-
                     rity groups are specified using both securityGroupIds and
                     launchTemplate , the values in securityGroupIds are used.

                     (string)

                 ec2KeyPair -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  EC2  key  pair  that's  used  for  instances
                     launched in the compute environment. You can use this key
                     pair to log in to your instances with SSH.

                     NOTE:
                        This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are  run-
                        ning on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

                 instanceRole -> (string)
                     The Amazon ECS instance profile applied to Amazon EC2 in-
                     stances in a compute environment.  You  can  specify  the
                     short  name  or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an in-
                     stance profile. For example, `` ecsInstanceRole `` or
                     ``
                     arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id>    :instance-profile/ecsIn-
                     stanceRole  `` . For more information, see Amazon ECS In-
                     stance Role in the Batch User Guide .

                     NOTE:
                        This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are  run-
                        ning on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

                 tags -> (map)
                     Key-value  pair  tags to be applied to EC2 resources that
                     are launched in the compute environment. For Batch, these
                     take  the  form of "String1": "String2", where String1 is
                     the tag key and String2 is the tag  valuefor  example,  {
                     "Name": "Batch Instance - C4OnDemand" } . This is helpful
                     for recognizing your Batch instances in  the  Amazon  EC2
                     console. These tags can't be updated or removed after the
                     compute environment is created. Any changes to these tags
                     require that you create a new compute environment and re-
                     move the old compute environment. These tags aren't  seen
                     when using the Batch ListTagsForResource API operation.

                     NOTE:
                        This  parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are run-
                        ning on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 placementGroup -> (string)
                     The Amazon EC2 placement group  to  associate  with  your
                     compute  resources.  If  you  intend to submit multi-node
                     parallel jobs to your  compute  environment,  you  should
                     consider creating a cluster placement group and associate
                     it  with  your  compute  resources.   This   keeps   your
                     multi-node  parallel  job  on  a  logical grouping of in-
                     stances within a single Availability Zone with high  net-
                     work  flow potential. For more information, see Placement
                     Groups in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances .

                     NOTE:
                        This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are  run-
                        ning on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

                 bidPercentage -> (integer)
                     The  maximum percentage that a Spot Instance price can be
                     when compared with the On-Demand price for that  instance
                     type  before instances are launched. For example, if your
                     maximum percentage is 20%, then the Spot  price  must  be
                     less  than  20%  of  the current On-Demand price for that
                     Amazon EC2 instance. You always pay the  lowest  (market)
                     price and never more than your maximum percentage. If you
                     leave this field empty, the default value is 100% of  the
                     On-Demand price.

                     NOTE:
                        This  parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are run-
                        ning on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.

                 spotIamFleetRole -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  Amazon  EC2  Spot
                     Fleet  IAM  role  applied  to a SPOT compute environment.
                     This role is required if the allocation strategy  set  to
                     BEST_FIT  or  if the allocation strategy isn't specified.
                     For more information, see Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet  Role  in
                     the Batch User Guide .

                     WARNING:
                        To tag your Spot Instances on creation, the Spot Fleet
                        IAM  role  specified  here  must  use  the  newer Ama-
                        zonEC2SpotFleetTaggingRole managed policy. The  previ-
                        ously  recommended AmazonEC2SpotFleetRole managed pol-
                        icy doesn't have the required permissions to tag  Spot
                        Instances.  For  more  information, see Spot Instances
                        not tagged on creation in the Batch User Guide .

                 launchTemplate -> (structure)
                     The launch template to use for  your  compute  resources.
                     Any other compute resource parameters that you specify in
                     a  CreateComputeEnvironment API  operation  override  the
                     same  parameters in the launch template. You must specify
                     either the launch template ID or launch template name  in
                     the  request,  but  not  both.  For more information, see
                     Launch Template Support in the Batch User Guide .

                        The name of the launch template.

                     version -> (string)
                        The  version  number of the launch template, $Latest ,
                        or $Default .

                        If the value is $Latest , the latest  version  of  the
                        launch  template  is  used. If the value is $Default ,
                        the default version of the launch template is used.

                        WARNING:
                            After the  compute  environment  is  created,  the
                            launch template version that's used isn't changed,
                            even if the $Default or $Latest  version  for  the
                            launch  template  is  updated. To use a new launch
