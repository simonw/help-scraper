LIST-JOBS()                                                        LIST-JOBS()



NAME
       list-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of Batch jobs.

       You must specify only one of the following items:

       o A job queue ID to return a list of jobs in that job queue

       o A multi-node parallel job ID to return a list of nodes for that job

       o An array job ID to return a list of the children for that job

       You  can filter the results by job status with the jobStatus parameter.
       If you don't specify a status, only RUNNING jobs are returned.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation by providing the --no-paginate argument.   When  using  --output
       text  and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query ar-
       gument must extract data from the results of the  following  query  ex-
       pressions: jobSummaryList

OPTIONS
       --job-queue (string)
          The name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job queue used to
          list jobs.

       --array-job-id (string)
          The job ID for an array job. Specifying an array job  ID  with  this
          parameter lists all child jobs from within the specified array.

       --multi-node-job-id (string)
          The  job  ID  for a multi-node parallel job. Specifying a multi-node
          parallel job ID with this parameter lists all nodes that are associ-
          ated with the specified job.

       --job-status (string)
          The  job  status  used to filter jobs in the specified queue. If the
          filters parameter is specified, the jobStatus parameter  is  ignored
          and  jobs  with any status are returned. If you don't specify a sta-
          tus, only RUNNING jobs are returned.

          Possible values:

          o SUBMITTED

          o PENDING

          o RUNNABLE

          o STARTING

          o RUNNING

          o SUCCEEDED

          o FAILED

       --filters (list)
          The filter to apply to the query. Only one filter can be used  at  a
          time.  When  the  filter  is  used, jobStatus is ignored. The filter
          doesn't apply to child jobs in an array or multi-node parallel (MNP)
          jobs.  The  results are sorted by the createdAt field, with the most
          recent jobs being first.
              JOB_NAME

          The value of the filter is a  case-insensitive  match  for  the  job
          name. If the value ends with an asterisk (*), the filter matches any
          job name that begins with the string before  the  '*'.  This  corre-
          sponds  to  the jobName value. For example, test1 matches both Test1
          and test1 , and test1* matches both test1  and  Test10  .  When  the
          JOB_NAME filter is used, the results are grouped by the job name and
          version.
              JOB_DEFINITION

          The value for the filter is the name or Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)
          of  the job definition. This corresponds to the jobDefinition value.
          The value is case sensitive. When the value for the  filter  is  the
          job  definition name, the results include all the jobs that used any
          revision of that job definition name. If the value ends with an  as-
          terisk  (*),  the filter matches any job definition name that begins
          with the string before the '*'. For example, jd1 matches only jd1  ,
          and  jd1* matches both jd1 and jd1A . The version of the job defini-
          tion that's used doesn't affect the sort order. When the JOB_DEFINI-
          TION  filter  is  used  and  the  ARN  is used (which is in the form
          arn:${Partition}:batch:${Region}:${Account}:job-definition/${JobDef-
          initionName}:${Revision}  ),  the results include jobs that used the
          specified revision of the job definition. Asterisk  (*)  isn't  sup-
          ported when the ARN is used.
              BEFORE_CREATED_AT

          The  value for the filter is the time that's before the job was cre-
          ated. This corresponds to the createdAt value. The value is a string
          representation  of  the  number  of  milliseconds since 00:00:00 UTC
          (midnight) on January 1, 1970.
              AFTER_CREATED_AT

          The value for the filter is the time that's after the job  was  cre-
          ated. This corresponds to the createdAt value. The value is a string
          representation of the number  of  milliseconds  since  00:00:00  UTC
          (midnight) on January 1, 1970.
              (structure)

              A  filter  name and value pair that's used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a ListJobs API operation.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case sensitive.

              values -> (list)
                 The filter values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                      "jobId": "68f0c163-fbd4-44e6-9fd1-25b14a434786"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       jobSummaryList -> (list)
          A list of job summaries that match the request.

          (structure)
              An object that represents summary details of a job.

              jobArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job.

              jobId -> (string)
                 The job ID.

              createdAt -> (long)
                 The Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) for  when  the  job  was
                 created.  For  non-array  jobs and parent array jobs, this is
                 when the job entered the SUBMITTED state (at the  time   Sub-
                 mitJob  was  called).  For array child jobs, this is when the
                 child job was spawned by its parent and entered  the  PENDING
                 state.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status for the job.

              statusReason -> (string)
                 A  short,  human-readable  string to provide more details for
                 the current status of the job.

              startedAt -> (long)
                 The Unix timestamp for when the job was started. More specif-
                 ically,  it's  when  the  job  transitioned from the STARTING
                 state to the RUNNING state.

              stoppedAt -> (long)
                 The Unix timestamp for when the job was stopped. More specif-
                 ically, it's when the job transitioned from the RUNNING state
                 to a terminal state, such as SUCCEEDED or FAILED .

              container -> (structure)
                 An object that represents the details of the container that's
                 associated with the job.

                 exitCode -> (integer)
                     The exit code to return upon completion.

                 reason -> (string)
                     A  short  (255  max  characters) human-readable string to

                     tainer.

              arrayProperties -> (structure)
                 The array properties of the job, if it's an array job.

                 size -> (integer)
                     The size of the array job. This parameter is returned for
                     parent array jobs.

                 index -> (integer)
                     The job index within the  array  that's  associated  with
                     this  job. This parameter is returned for children of ar-
                     ray jobs.

              nodeProperties -> (structure)
                 The node properties for a single node in a job summary list.

                 NOTE:
                     This isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate
                     resources.

                 isMainNode -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether the current node is the main node for a
                     multi-node parallel job.

                 numNodes -> (integer)
                     The number of nodes that are associated with a multi-node
                     parallel job.

                 nodeIndex -> (integer)
                     The  node index for the node. Node index numbering begins
                     at zero. This index is also available on  the  node  with
                     the AWS_BATCH_JOB_NODE_INDEX environment variable.

              jobDefinition -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job definition.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  nextToken  value  to include in a future ListJobs request. When
          the results of a ListJobs request exceed maxResults , this value can
          be  used  to  retrieve  the next page of results. This value is null
          when there are no more results to return.
