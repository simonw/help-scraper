NAME
       describe-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes a list of Batch jobs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-jobs
          --jobs <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --jobs (list)
          A list of up to 100 job IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status for the job.

                 NOTE:
                     If  your jobs don't progress to STARTING , see Jobs Stuck
                     in RUNNABLE Status in the troubleshooting section of  the
                     Batch User Guide .

                 The  scheduling  policy  of the job definition. This only af-
                 fects jobs in job queues with a fair share policy. Jobs  with
                 a higher scheduling priority are scheduled before jobs with a
                 lower scheduling priority.

              attempts -> (list)
                 A list of job attempts associated with this job.

                 (structure)

                     container -> (structure)
                        Details about the container in this job attempt.

                        containerInstanceArn -> (string)

                            The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon ECS
                            task that's associated with the job attempt.  Each
                            container  attempt  receives  a task ARN when they
                            reach the STARTING status.

                        exitCode -> (integer)
                            The exit code for the job attempt. A non-zero exit
                            code is considered a failure.

                            ated with the container. The log group  for  Batch
                            jobs  is  /aws/batch/job  . Each container attempt
                            receives a log stream name  when  they  reach  the
                            RUNNING status.

                                   The  attachment  ID  for the network inter-
                                   face.

                               ipv6Address -> (string)

                        The Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) for when the  at-
                        tempt  was started (when the attempt transitioned from
                        the STARTING state to the RUNNING state).

                     stoppedAt -> (long)
                        The Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) for when the  at-
                        tempt  was stopped (when the attempt transitioned from
                        the RUNNING state to a terminal state,  such  as  SUC-
                        CEEDED or FAILED ).

                     statusReason -> (string)
                        A  short,  human-readable string to provide additional
                        details about the current status of the job attempt.

              statusReason -> (string)
                 A short, human-readable string to provide additional  details
                 about the current status of the job.

              createdAt -> (long)
                 The  Unix  timestamp  (in  milliseconds) for when the job was
                 created. For non-array jobs and parent array  jobs,  this  is
                 when  the  job entered the SUBMITTED state (at the time  Sub-
                 mitJob was called). For array child jobs, this  is  when  the
                 child  job  was spawned by its parent and entered the PENDING
                 state.

              retryStrategy -> (structure)
                 The retry strategy to use for this job if an attempt fails.

                 attempts -> (integer)
                     The number of times to move a job to the RUNNABLE status.
                     You  can  specify between 1 and 10 attempts. If the value
                     of attempts is greater than one, the job  is  retried  on
                     failure the same number of attempts as the value.

                 evaluateOnExit -> (list)
                     Array  of  up  to 5 objects that specify conditions under
                     which the job should be retried or failed. If this param-
                     eter  is specified, then the attempts parameter must also
                     be specified.

                     (structure)
                        Specifies a set of conditions to be met, and an action
                        to take (RETRY or EXIT ) if all conditions are met.

                        onStatusReason -> (string)
                            Contains  a glob pattern to match against the Sta-
                            tusReason returned for a job. The pattern  can  be
                            up  to  512  characters  in length. It can contain
                            letters, numbers, periods  (.),  colons  (:),  and
                            white space (including spaces or tabs). It can op-
                            tionally end with an asterisk (*) so that only the
                            start of the string needs to be an exact match.

                            The  string can be between 1 and 512 characters in
                            length.

                        onReason -> (string)
                            Contains a glob pattern to match against the  Rea-
                            son  returned  for a job. The pattern can be up to
                            512 characters in length. It can contain  letters,
                            numbers,  periods (.), colons (:), and white space
                            (including spaces and tabs). It can optionally end
                            with an asterisk (*) so that only the start of the
                            string needs to be an exact match.

                            The string can be between 1 and 512 characters  in
                            length.

                        onExitCode -> (string)
                            Contains a glob pattern to match against the deci-
                            mal representation of the ExitCode returned for  a
                            job.  The  pattern  can be up to 512 characters in
                            length. It can contain only numbers, and  can  op-
                            tionally end with an asterisk (*) so that only the
                            start of the string needs to be an exact match.

                            The string can be between 1 and 512 characters  in
                            length.

                        action -> (string)
                            Specifies  the action to take if all of the speci-
                            fied conditions (onStatusReason , onReason  ,  and
                            onExitCode  ) are met. The values aren't case sen-
                            sitive.

              startedAt -> (long)
                 The Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) for  when  the  job  was
                 started (when the job transitioned from the STARTING state to
                 the RUNNING state). This parameter isn't provided  for  child
                 jobs of array jobs or multi-node parallel jobs.

              stoppedAt -> (long)
                 The  Unix  timestamp  (in  milliseconds) for when the job was
                 stopped (when the job transitioned from the RUNNING state  to
                 a terminal state, such as SUCCEEDED or FAILED ).

              dependsOn -> (list)
                 A list of job IDs that this job depends on.

                 (structure)
                     An object representing an Batch job dependency.

                     jobId -> (string)
                        The  job  ID of the Batch job associated with this de-
                        pendency.

                     type -> (string)
                        The type of the job dependency.

              jobDefinition -> (string)
                 The job definition that's used by this job.

              parameters -> (map)
                 Additional parameters passed to the job that replace  parame-
                 ter  substitution  placeholders or override any corresponding
                 parameter defaults from the job definition.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              container -> (structure)
                 An object representing the details of  the  container  that's
                 associated with the job.

                 image -> (string)
                     The image used to start the container.

                 vcpus -> (integer)
                     The  number of vCPUs reserved for the container. For jobs
                     that run on EC2 resources, you can specify the  vCPU  re-
                     quirement  for  the  job using resourceRequirements , but
                     you can't specify the vCPU requirements in both the vcpus
                     and  resourceRequirements  object. This parameter maps to
                     CpuShares in the Create a container section of the Docker
                     Remote  API  and  the --cpu-shares option to docker run .
                     Each vCPU is equivalent to 1,024  CPU  shares.  You  must
                     specify  at  least  one vCPU. This is required but can be
                     specified in several places. It  must  be  specified  for
                     each node at least once.

                     NOTE:
                        This  parameter  isn't  applicable to jobs that run on
                        Fargate resources. For jobs that run  on  Fargate  re-
                        sources, you must specify the vCPU requirement for the
                        job using resourceRequirements .

                 memory -> (integer)
                     For jobs running on EC2  resources  that  didn't  specify
                     memory requirements using resourceRequirements , the num-
                     ber of MiB of memory reserved  for  the  job.  For  other
                     jobs,  including  all  run  on Fargate resources, see re-
                     sourceRequirements .

                 command -> (list)
                     The command that's passed to the container.

                     (string)

                 jobRoleArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) associated  with  the  job
                     upon execution.

                 executionRoleArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the execution role that
                     Batch can assume. For more information, see Batch  execu-
                     tion IAM role in the Batch User Guide .

                 volumes -> (list)
                     A list of volumes associated with the job.

                     (structure)
                        A data volume used in a job's container properties.

                        host -> (structure)
                            The  contents  of  the  host  parameter  determine
                            whether your data volume persists on the host con-
                            tainer  instance  and  where  it is stored. If the
                            host parameter is empty, then  the  Docker  daemon
                            assigns a host path for your data volume. However,
                            the data isn't guaranteed  to  persist  after  the
                            containers associated with it stop running.

                            NOTE:
                               This  parameter  isn't  applicable to jobs that
                               are running on Fargate resources and  shouldn't
                               be provided.

                            sourcePath -> (string)
                               The  path on the host container instance that's
                               presented to the container. If  this  parameter
                               is empty, then the Docker daemon has assigned a
                               host path for you. If this parameter contains a
                               file location, then the data volume persists at
                               the specified location on  the  host  container
                               instance  until  you delete it manually. If the
                               source path location doesn't exist on the  host
                               container  instance,  the Docker daemon creates
                               it. If the location does exist, the contents of
                               the source path folder are exported.

                               NOTE:
                                   This  parameter  isn't  applicable  to jobs
                                   that run on Fargate resources and shouldn't
                                   be provided.

                        name -> (string)
                            The  name  of the volume. It can be up to 255 let-
                            ters long. It can contain uppercase and  lowercase
                            letters,  numbers,  hyphens  (-),  and underscores
                            (_). This name is referenced in  the  sourceVolume
                            parameter of container definition mountPoints .

                        efsVolumeConfiguration -> (structure)
                            This  parameter is specified when you are using an
                            Amazon Elastic File System  file  system  for  job
                            storage.  Jobs  that  are  running  on Fargate re-
                            sources must specify a platformVersion of at least
                            1.4.0 .

                            fileSystemId -> (string)
                               The Amazon EFS file system ID to use.

                            rootDirectory -> (string)
                               The directory within the Amazon EFS file system
                               to mount as the root directory inside the host.
                               If  this  parameter is omitted, the root of the
                               Amazon EFS volume is used instead. Specifying /
                               has the same effect as omitting this parameter.
                               The maximum length is 4,096 characters.

                               WARNING:
                                   If an EFS access point is specified in  the
                                   authorizationConfig  ,  the  root directory
                                   parameter must either be omitted or set  to
                                   / , which enforces the path set on the Ama-
                                   zon EFS access point.

                            transitEncryption -> (string)
                               Determines whether  to  enable  encryption  for
                               Amazon  EFS  data in transit between the Amazon
                               ECS host and the Amazon EFS server. Transit en-
                               cryption  must be enabled if Amazon EFS IAM au-
                               thorization is used. If this parameter is omit-
                               ted, the default value of DISABLED is used. For
                               more information, see Encrypting data in  tran-

                            transitEncryptionPort -> (integer)
                               The port to use when sending encrypted data be-
                               tween  the  Amazon  ECS host and the Amazon EFS
                               server. If you don't specify a transit  encryp-
                               tion  port, it uses the port selection strategy
                               that the Amazon  EFS  mount  helper  uses.  The
                               value  must  be  between 0 and 65,535. For more

                               Amazon EFS file system.

                               accessPointId -> (string)
                                   The Amazon EFS access point ID to  use.  If
                                   an  access point is specified, the root di-
                                   rectory value specified in  the  EFSVolume-
                                   Configuration must either be omitted or set
                                   to / which will enforce the path set on the
                                   EFS  access  point.  If  an access point is
                                   used, transit encryption must be enabled in
                                   the  EFSVolumeConfiguration  . For more in-

                                   mounting the Amazon EFS file system. If en-
                                   abled,  transit  encryption must be enabled
                                   in the EFSVolumeConfiguration . If this pa-
                                   rameter  is  omitted,  the default value of
                                   DISABLED is used. For more information, see

                     (structure)
                        The  type and amount of a resource to assign to a con-
                        tainer. The supported resources include GPU , MEMORY ,
                        and VCPU .

                        value -> (string)
                            The  quantity of the specified resource to reserve
                            for the container. The values vary  based  on  the
                            type specified.
                               type="GPU"

                            The  number  of  physical  GPUs to reserve for the
                            container. The number of  GPUs  reserved  for  all
                            containers in a job shouldn't exceed the number of
                            available GPUs on the compute  resource  that  the
                            job is launched on.

                            NOTE:
                               GPUs  are  not available for jobs that are run-
                               ning on Fargate resources.

                               type="MEMORY"

                            The memory hard limit (in MiB) present to the con-
                            tainer.  This parameter is supported for jobs that
                            are running on EC2 resources.  If  your  container
                            attempts  to exceed the memory specified, the con-
                            tainer is terminated. This parameter maps to  Mem-
                            ory  in  the  Create  a  container  section of the
                            Docker Remote  API  and  the  --memory  option  to
                            docker  run  .  You must specify at least 4 MiB of
                            memory for a job. This  is  required  but  can  be
                            specified  in several places for multi-node paral-
                            lel (MNP) jobs. It must be specified for each node
                            at  least  once.  This parameter maps to Memory in
                            the Create a container section of the  Docker  Re-
                            mote API and the --memory option to docker run .

                            NOTE:
                               If you're trying to maximize your resource uti-
                               lization by providing your jobs as much  memory
                               as possible for a particular instance type, see
                               Memory Management in the Batch User Guide .

                            then  value  is  the hard limit (in MiB), and must
                            match one of the supported  values  and  the  VCPU
                            values  must  be  one  of the values supported for
                            that memory value.

                            --cpu-shares option to docker run . Each  vCPU  is
                            equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares. For EC2 resources,
                            you must specify at least one vCPU.  This  is  re-
                            quired  but can be specified in several places; it
                            must be specified for each node at least once.

                               (string)

                     maxSwap -> (integer)
                        The total amount of swap memory (in MiB)  a  container
                        can  use.  This  parameter is translated to the --mem-
                        ory-swap option to docker run where the value  is  the
                        sum  of  the  container memory plus the maxSwap value.
                        For more information, see ` --memory-swap  details  <-
                        https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/re-
                        source_constraints/#--memory-swap-details>`__  in  the
                        Docker documentation.

                        If  a  maxSwap  value of 0 is specified, the container
                        doesn't use swap. Accepted values are 0 or  any  posi-
                        tive integer. If the maxSwap parameter is omitted, the
                        container doesn't use the swap configuration  for  the
                        container  instance  it is running on. A maxSwap value
                        must be set for the swappiness parameter to be used.

                        NOTE:
                            This parameter isn't applicable to jobs  that  are
                            running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be pro-
                            vided.

                     swappiness -> (integer)
                        This allows you to tune a container's  memory  swappi-
                        ness behavior. A swappiness value of 0 causes swapping
                        not to happen unless absolutely necessary.  A  swappi-
                        ness  value of 100 causes pages to be swapped very ag-
                        gressively. Accepted values are whole numbers  between
                        0  and  100 . If the swappiness parameter isn't speci-
                        fied, a default value of 60 is used. If a value  isn't
                        specified  for  maxSwap  ,  then this parameter is ig-
                        nored. If maxSwap is set to 0, the  container  doesn't
                        use  swap. This parameter maps to the --memory-swappi-
                        ness option to docker run .

                        Consider the following when you  use  a  per-container
                        swap configuration.

                        o Swap space must be enabled and allocated on the con-
                          tainer instance for the containers to use.

                        NOTE:
                            The Amazon ECS optimized AMIs don't have swap  en-
                            abled  by default. You must enable swap on the in-
                            stance to use this feature. For more  information,
                            see  Instance Store Swap Volumes in the Amazon EC2
                            User Guide for Linux Instances or How do  I  allo-
                            cate memory to work as swap space in an Amazon EC2
                            instance by using a swap file?

                        o The swap space parameters are only supported for job
                          definitions using EC2 resources.

                        o If the maxSwap and swappiness parameters are omitted
                          from a job definition, each container  will  have  a
                          default  swappiness  value of 60, and the total swap
                          usage will be limited to two times the memory reser-
                          vation of the container.

                        NOTE:
                            This  parameter  isn't applicable to jobs that are
                            running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be pro-
                            vided.

                 logConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The log configuration specification for the container.

                     This  parameter  maps  to  LogConfig in the Create a con-
                     tainer  section  of  the  Docker  Remote  API   and   the
                     --log-driver  option to docker run . By default, contain-
                     ers use the same logging driver that  the  Docker  daemon
                     uses.  However,  the container might use a different log-
                     ging driver than the Docker daemon by  specifying  a  log
                     driver  with  this parameter in the container definition.
                     To use a different logging driver for  a  container,  the
                     log  system  must be configured properly on the container
                     instance. Or, alternatively, it must be configured  on  a
                     different log server for remote logging options. For more
                     information on the options for  different  supported  log
                     drivers, see Configure logging drivers in the Docker doc-
                     umentation.

                     NOTE:
                        Batch currently supports a subset of the logging driv-
                        ers available to the Docker daemon (shown in the  Log-
                        Configuration data type). Additional log drivers might
                        be available in future releases of the Amazon ECS con-
                        tainer agent.

                     This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote
                     API  or  greater on your container instance. To check the
                     Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log
                     into  your  container instance and run the following com-
                     mand: sudo docker version | grep "Server API version"

                     NOTE:
                        The Amazon ECS container agent running on a  container
                        instance  must  register the logging drivers available
                        on that instance with the  ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIV-
                        ERS  environment  variable before containers placed on
                        that instance can use these log configuration options.

                     logDriver -> (string)
                        The  log  driver  to  use for the container. The valid
                        values listed for this parameter are log drivers  that
                        the Amazon ECS container agent can communicate with by
                        default.

                        The supported log drivers are awslogs , fluentd , gelf
                        ,  json-file  ,  journald  , logentries , syslog , and
                        splunk .

                        NOTE:
                            Jobs that are running on Fargate resources are re-
                            stricted to the awslogs and splunk log drivers.

                            awslogs

                        NOTE:
                            If you have a custom driver that's not listed ear-
                            lier that you want to work  with  the  Amazon  ECS
                            container  agent, you can fork the Amazon ECS con-
                            tainer agent project that's  available  on  GitHub
                            and  customize it to work with that driver. We en-
                            courage you to submit pull  requests  for  changes
                            that  you  want  to have included. However, Amazon
                            Web Services  doesn't  currently  support  running
                            modified copies of this software.

                        This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Re-
                        mote API or greater on  your  container  instance.  To
                        check  the Docker Remote API version on your container
                        instance, log into your container instance and run the
                        following  command: sudo docker version | grep "Server

                        (structure)
                            An object representing the  secret  to  expose  to
                            your  container.  Secrets can be exposed to a con-
                            tainer in the following ways:

                            o To inject sensitive data into your containers as
                              environment variables, use the secrets container
                              definition parameter.

                            o To reference sensitive information  in  the  log
                              configuration  of a container, use the secretOp-

                               The name of the secret.

                            valueFrom -> (string)
                               The secret to expose to the container. The sup-
                               ported values are either the full  ARN  of  the
                               Secrets  Manager  secret or the full ARN of the
                               parameter in the Amazon  Web  Services  Systems

                                   then you can use either  the  full  ARN  or
                                   name of the parameter. If the parameter ex-
                                   ists in a different Region, then  the  full
                                   ARN must be specified.

                 secrets -> (list)

                        valueFrom -> (string)
                            The secret to expose to the  container.  The  sup-
                            ported  values  are either the full ARN of the Se-
                            crets Manager secret or the full ARN of the param-
                            eter  in  the  Amazon Web Services Systems Manager
                            Parameter Store.

                            NOTE:
                               If the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager  Pa-

                               gion as the job you're launching, then you  can
                               use  either the full ARN or name of the parame-
                               ter. If the parameter exists in a different Re-
                               gion, then the full ARN must be specified.

                 networkConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The  network  configuration  for jobs that are running on
                     Fargate resources. Jobs that are running on EC2 resources
                     must not specify this parameter.

                     assignPublicIp -> (string)
                        Indicates  whether the job should have a public IP ad-

                        The Fargate platform version where the jobs  are  run-
                        ning.  A  platform  version is specified only for jobs
                        that are running on Fargate resources.  If  one  isn't
                        specified,  the LATEST platform version is used by de-
                        fault. This uses a recent,  approved  version  of  the
                        Fargate  platform  for compute resources. For more in-
                        formation, see Fargate platform versions in the Amazon
                        Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

              nodeDetails -> (structure)
                 An  object  representing the details of a node that's associ-
                 ated with a multi-node parallel job.

                 nodeIndex -> (integer)
                     The node index for the node. Node index numbering  begins
                     at  zero.  This  index is also available on the node with
                     the AWS_BATCH_JOB_NODE_INDEX environment variable.

                 isMainNode -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether the current node is the main node for a
                     multi-node parallel job.

              nodeProperties -> (structure)
                 An  object  representing  the node properties of a multi-node
                 parallel job.

                 NOTE:
                     This isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate
                     resources.

                 numNodes -> (integer)
                     The number of nodes associated with a multi-node parallel
                     job.

                 mainNode -> (integer)
                     Specifies  the  node  index  for  the  main  node  of   a
                     multi-node  parallel  job.  This node index value must be
                     fewer than the number of nodes.

                 nodeRangeProperties -> (list)
                     A list of node ranges  and  their  properties  associated
                     with a multi-node parallel job.

                     (structure)
                        An  object  representing  the  properties  of the node
                        range for a multi-node parallel job.

                        targetNodes -> (string)
                            The range of nodes, using  node  index  values.  A
                            range  of 0:3 indicates nodes with index values of
                            0 through 3 . If the starting range value is omit-
                            ted  (:n  ), then 0 is used to start the range. If
                            the ending range value is omitted (n: ), then  the
                            highest  possible  node  index  is used to end the
                            range. Your accumulative node ranges must  account
                            for  all  nodes  (0:n ). You can nest node ranges,
                            for example 0:10 and 4:5 , in which case  the  4:5
                            range properties override the 0:10 properties.

                        container -> (structure)
                            The container details for the node range.

                            image -> (string)
                               The  image  used  to  start  a  container. This
                               string is passed directly to the Docker daemon.
                               Images in the Docker Hub registry are available
                               by default. Other  repositories  are  specified
                               with  ``  repository-url /image :tag `` . Up to
                               255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers,
                               hyphens,  underscores, colons, periods, forward
                               slashes, and number signs are allowed. This pa-
                               rameter maps to Image in the Create a container
                               section of the Docker Remote API and the  IMAGE
                               parameter of docker run .

                               NOTE:
                                   Docker  image  architecture  must match the
                                   processor architecture of the  compute  re-
                                   sources  that they're scheduled on. For ex-
                                   ample, ARM-based Docker images can only run
                                   on ARM-based compute resources.

                               o Images  in Amazon ECR Public repositories use
                                 the full  registry/repository[:tag]  or  reg-
                                 istry/repository[@digest] naming conventions.
                                 For example,
                                 ``
                                 public.ecr.aws/registry_alias     /my-web-app
                                 :latest `` .

                               System   Message:  WARNING/2  (<string>:,  line

                               o Images  in  Amazon  ECR  repositories use the
                                 full registry and repository URI  (for  exam-
                                 ple,  012345678910.dkr.ecr.<region-name>.ama-
                                 zonaws.com/<repository-name> ).

                               o Images in official repositories on Docker Hub
                                 use  a  single  name  (for example, ubuntu or
                                 mongo ).

                               o Images in other repositories  on  Docker  Hub
                                 are  qualified with an organization name (for
                                 example, amazon/amazon-ecs-agent ).

                               o Images in other online repositories are qual-
                                 ified  further by a domain name (for example,
                                 quay.io/assemblyline/ubuntu ).

                            vcpus -> (integer)
                               This   parameter   is   deprecated,   use   re-
                               sourceRequirements to specify the vCPU require-
                               ments for the job  definition.  It's  not  sup-
                               ported  for  jobs running on Fargate resources.
                               For jobs running on EC2 resources, it specifies
                               the number of vCPUs reserved for the job.

                               Each  vCPU  is  equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares.
                               This parameter maps to CpuShares in the  Create
                               a  container  section  of the Docker Remote API
                               and the --cpu-shares option to docker run . The
                               number  of  vCPUs  must be specified but can be
                               specified in several places. You  must  specify
                               it at least once for each node.

                            memory -> (integer)
                               This   parameter   is   deprecated,   use   re-
                               sourceRequirements to specify  the  memory  re-
                               quirements  for  the  job  definition. It's not
                               supported  for  jobs  running  on  Fargate  re-
                               sources.  For jobs running on EC2 resources, it
                               specifies the memory hard limit (in MiB) for  a
                               container. If your container attempts to exceed
                               the specified number, it's terminated. You must
                               specify  at least 4 MiB of memory for a job us-
                               ing this parameter. The memory hard  limit  can
                               be  specified  in  several  places.  It must be
                               specified for each node at least once.

                            command -> (list)
                               The command that's  passed  to  the  container.
                               This parameter maps to Cmd in the Create a con-
                               tainer section of the Docker Remote API and the
                               COMMAND  parameter to docker run . For more in-

                            jobRoleArn -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM  role
                               that  the  container  can assume for Amazon Web
                               Services permissions. For more information, see

                            executionRoleArn -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the execution
                               role  that  Batch can assume. For jobs that run
                               on Fargate resources, you must provide an  exe-
                               cution  role.  For  more information, see Batch
                               execution IAM role in the Batch User Guide .

                            volumes -> (list)
                               A list of data volumes used in a job.

                               (structure)
                                   A data volume used  in  a  job's  container
                                   properties.

                                   host -> (structure)
                                      The  contents  of the host parameter de-
                                      termine whether your  data  volume  per-
                                      sists on the host container instance and
                                      where it is stored. If the host  parame-
                                      ter is empty, then the Docker daemon as-
                                      signs a host path for your data  volume.
                                      However,  the  data  isn't guaranteed to
                                      persist after the containers  associated
                                      with it stop running.

                                      NOTE:
                                          This  parameter  isn't applicable to
                                          jobs that are running on Fargate re-
                                          sources and shouldn't be provided.

                                      sourcePath -> (string)
                                          The  path  on the host container in-
                                          stance that's presented to the  con-
                                          tainer.  If this parameter is empty,
                                          then the Docker daemon has  assigned
                                          a host path for you. If this parame-
                                          ter contains a file  location,  then
                                          the  data  volume  persists  at  the
                                          specified location on the host  con-
                                          tainer  instance until you delete it
                                          manually. If the source  path  loca-
                                          tion  doesn't exist on the host con-
                                          tainer instance, the  Docker  daemon
                                          creates it. If the location does ex-
                                          ist, the contents of the source path
                                          folder are exported.

                                          NOTE:
                                             This  parameter  isn't applicable
                                             to jobs that run on  Fargate  re-
                                             sources  and  shouldn't  be  pro-
                                             vided.

                                   name -> (string)
                                      The name of the volume. It can be up  to
                                      255  letters long. It can contain upper-
                                      case and lowercase letters, numbers, hy-
                                      phens  (-),  and  underscores  (_). This
                                      name is referenced in  the  sourceVolume
                                      parameter of container definition mount-

                                   efsVolumeConfiguration -> (structure)
                                      This parameter is specified when you are
                                      using an Amazon Elastic File System file
                                      system for job storage.  Jobs  that  are
                                      running  on Fargate resources must spec-

                                   to a container. The supported resources in-
                                   clude GPU , MEMORY , and VCPU .

                                   value -> (string)
                                      The  quantity  of the specified resource
                                      to reserve for the container. The values
                                      vary based on the type specified.
                                          type="GPU"

                                      for the container. The  number  of  GPUs
                                      reserved  for  all  containers  in a job
                                      shouldn't exceed the number of available
                                      GPUs  on  the  compute resource that the
                                      job is launched on.

                                      NOTE:

                                      to the container. This parameter is sup-
                                      ported  for jobs that are running on EC2
                                      resources. If your container attempts to
                                      exceed  the  memory  specified, the con-
                                      tainer  is  terminated.  This  parameter

                                      parallel  (MNP)  jobs. It must be speci-
                                      fied for each node at least  once.  This
                                      parameter maps to Memory in the Create a

                                   If a maxSwap value of 0 is  specified,  the
                                   container doesn't use swap. Accepted values
                                   are 0  or  any  positive  integer.  If  the
                                   maxSwap parameter is omitted, the container
                                   doesn't use the swap configuration for  the
                                   container  instance  it  is  running  on. A

                               swappiness -> (integer)
                                   This  allows you to tune a container's mem-
                                   ory swappiness behavior. A swappiness value
                                   of  0  causes swapping not to happen unless
                                   absolutely necessary. A swappiness value of
                                   100 causes pages to be swapped very aggres-
                                   sively. Accepted values are  whole  numbers
                                   between  0  and 100 . If the swappiness pa-
                                   rameter isn't specified, a default value of
                                   60  is used. If a value isn't specified for
                                   maxSwap , then this parameter  is  ignored.
                                   If  maxSwap  is  set  to  0,  the container
                                   doesn't use swap. This  parameter  maps  to
                                   the  --memory-swappiness  option  to docker
                                   run .

                                   Consider  the  following  when  you  use  a
                                   per-container swap configuration.

                                   o Swap  space must be enabled and allocated
                                     on the container instance  for  the  con-

                                      swap enabled by default. You must enable

                                   o If  the maxSwap and swappiness parameters
                                     are omitted from a job  definition,  each
                                     container  will have a default swappiness
                                     value of 60, and  the  total  swap  usage
                                     will  be  limited to two times the memory
                                     reservation of the container.

                            logConfiguration -> (structure)
                               The log  configuration  specification  for  the
                               container.

                               This  parameter maps to LogConfig in the Create

                               and  the --log-driver option to docker run . By
                               default, containers use the same logging driver
                               that  the  Docker daemon uses. However the con-
                               tainer might use  a  different  logging  driver
                               than  the  Docker  daemon  by  specifying a log
                               driver with this  parameter  in  the  container
                               definition.  To  use a different logging driver
                               for a container, the log system must be config-
                               ured  properly on the container instance (or on
                               a different log server for remote  logging  op-

              arrayProperties -> (structure)
                 The array properties of the job, if it is an array job.

                 statusSummary -> (map)
                     A  summary  of  the  number of array job children in each
                     available job status. This parameter is returned for par-
                     ent array jobs.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (integer)

                 size -> (integer)
                     The size of the array job. This parameter is returned for
                     parent array jobs.

                 index -> (integer)
                     The job index within the  array  that's  associated  with
                     this  job. This parameter is returned for array job chil-
                     dren.

              timeout -> (structure)
                 The timeout configuration for the job.

                 attemptDurationSeconds -> (integer)
                     The time duration in seconds (measured from the  job  at-
                     tempt's startedAt timestamp) after which Batch terminates
                     your jobs if they have not finished.  The  minimum  value
                     for the timeout is 60 seconds.

              tags -> (map)
                 The tags applied to the job.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              propagateTags -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  to propagate the tags from the job or job
                 definition to the corresponding Amazon ECS task. If no  value
                 is  specified,  the  tags aren't propagated. Tags can only be
                 propagated to the tasks during task creation. For  tags  with
                 the  same  name, job tags are given priority over job defini-
                 tions tags. If the total number of combined tags from the job
                 and job definition is over 50, the job is moved to the FAILED
                 state.

              platformCapabilities -> (list)
                 The platform capabilities required by the job definition.  If
                 no  value is specified, it defaults to EC2 . Jobs run on Far-
                 gate resources specify FARGATE .
