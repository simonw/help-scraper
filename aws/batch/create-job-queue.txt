CREATE-JOB-QUEUE()                                          CREATE-JOB-QUEUE()



NAME
       create-job-queue -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an Batch job queue. When you create a job queue, you associate
       one or more compute environments to the queue and assign  an  order  of
       preference for the compute environments.

       You also set a priority to the job queue that determines the order that
       the Batch scheduler places jobs onto its  associated  compute  environ-
       ments.  For  example,  if a compute environment is associated with more
       than one job queue, the job queue with a higher priority is given pref-
       erence for scheduling jobs to that compute environment.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-job-queue
          --job-queue-name <value>
          [--state <value>]
          [--scheduling-policy-arn <value>]
          --priority <value>
          --compute-environment-order <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-queue-name (string)
          The  name of the job queue. It can be up to 128 letters long. It can
          contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens  (-),  and
          underscores (_).

       --state (string)
          The  state  of the job queue. If the job queue state is ENABLED , it
          is able to accept jobs. If the job queue state  is  DISABLED  ,  new
          jobs  can't be added to the queue, but jobs already in the queue can
          finish.

          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

          o DISABLED

       --scheduling-policy-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the fair share scheduling  policy.
          If  this  parameter  is  specified,  the job queue uses a fair share
          scheduling policy. If this parameter isn't specified, the job  queue
          uses  a  first  in,  first out (FIFO) scheduling policy. After a job
          queue is created, you can replace but can't remove  the  fair  share
          scheduling  policy.  The  format  is aws:*Partition* :batch:*Region*
          :*Account*   :scheduling-policy/*Name*   ``   .   An   example    is
          ``aws:aws:batch:us-west-2:012345678910:scheduling-policy/MySchedul-
          ingPolicy .

       --priority (integer)
          The priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority (or
          a  higher  integer  value  for the priority parameter) are evaluated
          first when associated with the same compute environment. Priority is
          determined in descending order. For example, a job queue with a pri-
          ority value of 10 is given scheduling preference over  a  job  queue
          with a priority value of 1 . All of the compute environments must be
          either EC2 (EC2 or SPOT ) or Fargate (FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT ); EC2
          and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.

       --compute-environment-order (list)
          The  set of compute environments mapped to a job queue and their or-
          der relative to each other. The job scheduler uses this parameter to
          determine which compute environment runs a specific job. Compute en-
          vironments must be in the VALID state before you can associate  them
          with a job queue. You can associate up to three compute environments
          with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be either EC2
          (EC2  or  SPOT ) or Fargate (FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT ); EC2 and Far-
          gate compute environments can't be mixed.

          NOTE:
              All compute environments that are associated with  a  job  queue
              must  share  the same architecture. Batch doesn't support mixing
              compute environment architecture types in a single job queue.

          (structure)
              The order in which compute environments are tried for job place-
              ment within a queue. Compute environments are tried in ascending
              order. For example, if two compute environments  are  associated
              with a job queue, the compute environment with a lower order in-
              teger value is tried for job placement first.  Compute  environ-
              ments  must  be in the VALID state before you can associate them
              with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be either
              EC2  (EC2  or  SPOT ) or Fargate (FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT ); EC2
              and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.

              NOTE:
                 All compute environments that are associated with a job queue
                 must  share the same architecture. Batch doesn't support mix-
                 ing compute environment architecture types in  a  single  job
                 queue.

              order -> (integer)
                 The  order  of  the compute environment. Compute environments
                 are tried in ascending order. For example, if two compute en-
                 vironments are associated with a job queue, the compute envi-
                 ronment with a lower order integer value  is  tried  for  job
                 placement first.

              computeEnvironment -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the compute environment.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          order=integer,computeEnvironment=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "order": integer,
              "computeEnvironment": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --tags (map)
          The  tags that you apply to the job queue to help you categorize and
          organize your resources. Each tag consists of a key and an  optional
          value.  For  more  information,  see Tagging your Batch resources in
          Batch User Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a low priority job queue with a single compute environment

       This example creates a job  queue  called  LowPriority  that  uses  the
       M4Spot compute environment.

       Command:

          aws batch create-job-queue --cli-input-json file://<path_to_json_file>/LowPriority.json

       JSON file format:

          {
            "jobQueueName": "LowPriority",
            "state": "ENABLED",
            "priority": 10,
            "computeEnvironmentOrder": [
              {
                "order": 1,
                "computeEnvironment": "M4Spot"
              }
            ]
          }

       Output:

          {
              "jobQueueArn": "arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:012345678910:job-queue/LowPriority",
              "jobQueueName": "LowPriority"
          }

       To create a high priority job queue with two compute environments

       This  example  creates  a  job  queue called HighPriority that uses the
       C4OnDemand compute environment with an order of 1 and the  M4Spot  com-
       pute  environment  with  an  order  of 2. The scheduler will attempt to
       place jobs on the C4OnDemand compute environment first.

       Command:

          aws batch create-job-queue --cli-input-json file://<path_to_json_file>/HighPriority.json

       JSON file format:

          {
            "jobQueueName": "HighPriority",
            "state": "ENABLED",
            "priority": 1,
            "computeEnvironmentOrder": [
              {
                "order": 1,
                "computeEnvironment": "C4OnDemand"
              },
              {
                "order": 2,
                "computeEnvironment": "M4Spot"
              }
            ]
          }

       Output:

          {
              "jobQueueArn": "arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:012345678910:job-queue/HighPriority",
              "jobQueueName": "HighPriority"
          }

OUTPUT
       jobQueueName -> (string)
          The name of the job queue.

       jobQueueArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job queue.
