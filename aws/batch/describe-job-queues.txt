DESCRIBE-JOB-QUEUES()                                    DESCRIBE-JOB-QUEUES()



NAME
       describe-job-queues -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes one or more of your job queues.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-job-queues is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: jobQueues

SYNOPSIS
            describe-job-queues
          [--job-queues <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-queues (list)
          A list of up to 100 queue names or full queue Amazon  Resource  Name
          (ARN) entries.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a job queue

       This example describes the HighPriority job queue.

       Command:

          aws batch describe-job-queues --job-queues HighPriority

       Output:

          {
              "jobQueues": [
                  {
                      "status": "VALID",
                      "jobQueueArn": "arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:012345678910:job-queue/HighPriority",
                      "computeEnvironmentOrder": [
                          {
                              "computeEnvironment": "arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:012345678910:compute-environment/C4OnDemand",
                              "order": 1
                          }
                      ],
                      "statusReason": "JobQueue Healthy",
                      "priority": 1,
                      "state": "ENABLED",
                      "jobQueueName": "HighPriority"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       jobQueues -> (list)
          The list of job queues.

          (structure)
              An object representing the details of an Batch job queue.

              jobQueueName -> (string)
                 The name of the job queue.

              jobQueueArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job queue.

              state -> (string)
                 Describes the ability of the queue to accept new jobs. If the
                 job queue state is ENABLED , it's able to accept jobs. If the
                 job  queue state is DISABLED , new jobs can't be added to the
                 queue, but jobs already in the queue can finish.

              schedulingPolicyArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the scheduling policy.  The
                 format  is aws:*Partition* :batch:*Region* :*Account* :sched-
                 uling-policy/*Name*       ``       .       For       example,
                 ``aws:aws:batch:us-west-2:012345678910:scheduling-pol-
                 icy/MySchedulingPolicy .

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the job queue (for example, CREATING  or  VALID
                 ).

              statusReason -> (string)
                 A  short, human-readable string to provide additional details
                 about the current status of the job queue.

              priority -> (integer)
                 The priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher  pri-
                 ority  (or a higher integer value for the priority parameter)
                 are evaluated first when associated with the same compute en-
                 vironment.  Priority  is  determined in descending order, for
                 example, a job queue with a priority value  of  10  is  given
                 scheduling  preference over a job queue with a priority value
                 of 1 . All of the compute environments  must  be  either  EC2
                 (EC2 or SPOT ) or Fargate (FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT ); EC2 and
                 Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.

              computeEnvironmentOrder -> (list)
                 The compute environments that are attached to the  job  queue
                 and  the order that job placement is preferred. Compute envi-
                 ronments are selected for job placement in ascending order.

                 (structure)
                     The order in which compute environments are tried for job
                     placement  within a queue. Compute environments are tried
                     in ascending order. For example, if two compute  environ-
                     ments  are associated with a job queue, the compute envi-
                     ronment with a lower order integer value is tried for job
                     placement  first.  Compute  environments  must  be in the
                     VALID state before you can  associate  them  with  a  job
                     queue. All of the compute environments must be either EC2
                     (EC2 or SPOT ) or Fargate (FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT ); EC2
                     and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.

                     NOTE:
                        All  compute  environments  that are associated with a
                        job queue must  share  the  same  architecture.  Batch
                        doesn't  support  mixing compute environment architec-
                        ture types in a single job queue.

                     order -> (integer)
                        The order of the compute environment. Compute environ-
                        ments  are  tried  in ascending order. For example, if
                        two compute environments are  associated  with  a  job
                        queue,  the compute environment with a lower order in-
                        teger value is tried for job placement first.

                     computeEnvironment -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the compute environ-
                        ment.

              tags -> (map)
                 The  tags applied to the job queue. For more information, see
                 Tagging your Batch resources in Batch User Guide .

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken value to include in  a  future  DescribeJobQueues  re-
          quest. When the results of a DescribeJobQueues request exceed maxRe-
          sults , this value can be used to retrieve the next page of results.
          This value is null when there are no more results to return.
