DELETE-COMPUTE-ENVIRONMENT()                      DELETE-COMPUTE-ENVIRONMENT()



NAME
       delete-compute-environment -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes an Batch compute environment.

       Before  you can delete a compute environment, you must set its state to
       DISABLED with the  UpdateComputeEnvironment API operation and  disasso-
       ciate  it  from  any job queues with the  UpdateJobQueue API operation.
       Compute environments that use Fargate resources must terminate all  ac-
       tive jobs on that compute environment before deleting the compute envi-
       ronment. If this isn't done, the compute environment enters an  invalid
       state.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-compute-environment
          --compute-environment <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --compute-environment (string)
          The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the compute environment to
          delete.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
