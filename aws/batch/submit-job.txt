SUBMIT-JOB()                                                      SUBMIT-JOB()



NAME
       submit-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Submits  an Batch job from a job definition. Parameters that are speci-
       fied during  SubmitJob override parameters defined in the  job  defini-
       tion.  vCPU  and  memory  requirements  that  are  specified in the re-
       sourceRequirements objects in the job  definition  are  the  exception.
       They  can't  be  overridden this way using the memory and vcpus parame-
       ters. Rather, you must specify updates to job definition parameters  in
       a resourceRequirements object that's included in the containerOverrides
       parameter.

       NOTE:
          Job queues with a scheduling policy are limited to 500  active  fair
          share identifiers at a time.

       WARNING:
          Jobs  that  run  on Fargate resources can't be guaranteed to run for
          more than 14 days. This is because, after 14 days, Fargate resources
          might become unavailable and job might be terminated.

OPTIONS
       --job-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  job. It can be up to 128 letters long. The first
          character must be alphanumeric, can contain uppercase and  lowercase
          letters, numbers, hyphens (-), and underscores (_).

       --job-queue (string)
          The job queue where the job is submitted. You can specify either the
          name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the queue.

       --share-identifier (string)
          The share identifier for the job. If the job queue  doesn't  have  a
          scheduling policy, then this parameter must not be specified. If the
          job queue has a scheduling policy, then this parameter must be spec-
          ified.

       --scheduling-priority-override (integer)
          The  scheduling  priority for the job. This only affects jobs in job
          queues with a fair share policy. Jobs with a higher scheduling  pri-
          ority  are  scheduled  before jobs with a lower scheduling priority.
          This overrides any scheduling priority in the job definition.

          The minimum supported value is 0 and the maximum supported value  is
          9999.

       --array-properties (structure)
          The  array properties for the submitted job, such as the size of the
          array. The array size can be between 2 and 10,000.  If  you  specify
          array properties for a job, it becomes an array job. For more infor-
          mation, see Array Jobs in the Batch User Guide .

          size -> (integer)
              The size of the array job.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          size=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "size": integer
          }

       --depends-on (list)
          A list of dependencies for the job. A job can depend upon a  maximum
          of  20  jobs.  You  can specify a SEQUENTIAL type dependency without
          specifying a job ID for array jobs so that each child array job com-
          pletes  sequentially,  starting  at index 0. You can also specify an
          N_TO_N type dependency with a job ID for array jobs. In  that  case,
          each  index  child of this job must wait for the corresponding index
          child of each dependency to complete before it can begin.

          (structure)
              An object that represents an Batch job dependency.

              jobId -> (string)
                 The job ID of the Batch job that's associated with  this  de-
                 pendency.

              type -> (string)
                 The type of the job dependency.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          jobId=string,type=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "jobId": "string",
              "type": "N_TO_N"|"SEQUENTIAL"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --job-definition (string)
          The job definition used by this job. This value can be one of name ,
          name:revision , or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the job  defi-
          nition.  If name is specified without a revision then the latest ac-
          tive revision is used.

       --parameters (map)
          Additional parameters passed to the job that replace parameter  sub-
          stitution  placeholders  that are set in the job definition. Parame-
          ters are specified as a key and value pair mapping. Parameters in  a
          SubmitJob request override any corresponding parameter defaults from
          the job definition.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --container-overrides (structure)
          An object with various properties that override the defaults for the
          job definition that specify the name of a container in the specified
          job definition and the overrides it should receive. You can override
          the  default  command for a container, which is specified in the job
          definition or the Docker image, with a  command  override.  You  can
          also  override  existing environment variables on a container or add
          new environment variables to it with an environment override.

          vcpus -> (integer)
              This parameter is deprecated, use resourceRequirements to  over-
              ride  the vcpus parameter that's set in the job definition. It's
              not supported for jobs running on Fargate  resources.  For  jobs
              that  run on EC2 resources, it overrides the vcpus parameter set
              in the job definition, but doesn't override any vCPU requirement
              specified in the resourceRequirements structure in the job defi-
              nition. To override vCPU requirements that are specified in  the
              resourceRequirements   structure  in  the  job  definition,  re-
              sourceRequirements must be specified in the  SubmitJob  request,
              with  type  set to VCPU and value set to the new value. For more
              information, see Can't override job definition resource require-
              ments in the Batch User Guide .

          memory -> (integer)
              This  parameter is deprecated, use resourceRequirements to over-
              ride the memory requirements specified in  the  job  definition.
              It's  not  supported  for jobs running on Fargate resources. For
              jobs that run on EC2 resources, it overrides the memory  parame-
              ter  set  in the job definition, but doesn't override any memory
              requirement that's specified in the resourceRequirements  struc-
              ture in the job definition. To override memory requirements that
              are specified in the resourceRequirements structure in  the  job
              definition,  resourceRequirements  must be specified in the Sub-
              mitJob request, with type set to MEMORY and value set to the new
              value.  For  more information, see Can't override job definition
              resource requirements in the Batch User Guide .

          command -> (list)
              The command to send to the container that overrides the  default
              command from the Docker image or the job definition.

              (string)

          instanceType -> (string)
              The instance type to use for a multi-node parallel job.

              NOTE:
                 This parameter isn't applicable to single-node container jobs
                 or jobs that run on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be  pro-
                 vided.

          environment -> (list)
              The  environment variables to send to the container. You can add
              new environment variables, which are added to the  container  at
              launch,  or  you can override the existing environment variables
              from the Docker image or the job definition.

              NOTE:
                 Environment variables cannot start with  "AWS_BATCH  ".  This
                 naming convention is reserved for variables that Batch sets.

              (structure)
                 A key-value pair object.

                 name -> (string)
                     The  name  of  the  key-value pair. For environment vari-
                     ables, this is the name of the environment variable.

                 value -> (string)
                     The value of the key-value pair.  For  environment  vari-
                     ables, this is the value of the environment variable.

          resourceRequirements -> (list)
              The  type and amount of resources to assign to a container. This
              overrides the settings in the job definition. The supported  re-
              sources include GPU , MEMORY , and VCPU .

              (structure)
                 The  type  and amount of a resource to assign to a container.
                 The supported resources include GPU , MEMORY , and VCPU .

                 value -> (string)
                     The quantity of the specified resource to reserve for the
                     container. The values vary based on the type specified.
                        type="GPU"

                     The number of physical GPUs to reserve for the container.
                     Make sure that the number of GPUs reserved for  all  con-
                     tainers  in  a job doesn't exceed the number of available
                     GPUs on the compute resource that the job is launched on.

                     NOTE:
                        GPUs aren't available for jobs  that  are  running  on
                        Fargate resources.

                        type="MEMORY"

                     The  memory hard limit (in MiB) present to the container.
                     This parameter is supported for jobs that are running  on
                     EC2  resources.  If your container attempts to exceed the
                     memory specified, the container is terminated.  This  pa-
                     rameter  maps to Memory in the Create a container section
                     of the Docker Remote  API  and  the  --memory  option  to
                     docker  run  .  You must specify at least 4 MiB of memory
                     for a job. This is required but can be specified in  sev-
                     eral  places  for multi-node parallel (MNP) jobs. It must
                     be specified for each node at least once. This  parameter
                     maps  to  Memory in the Create a container section of the
                     Docker Remote API and the --memory option to docker run .

                     NOTE:
                        If you're trying to maximize your resource utilization
                        by  providing your jobs as much memory as possible for
                        a particular instance type, see Memory  management  in
                        the Batch User Guide .

                     For  jobs  that  are  running  on Fargate resources, then
                     value is the hard limit (in MiB), and must match  one  of
                     the  supported  values and the VCPU values must be one of
                     the values supported for that memory value.
                            value = 512

                     The  number of vCPUs reserved for the container. This pa-
                     rameter maps to CpuShares in the Create a container  sec-
                     tion of the Docker Remote API and the --cpu-shares option
                     to docker run . Each vCPU  is  equivalent  to  1,024  CPU
                     shares.  For EC2 resources, you must specify at least one
                     vCPU. This is required but can be  specified  in  several
                     places; it must be specified for each node at least once.

                     For  jobs  that  are  running  on Fargate resources, then
                     value must match one of the supported values and the MEM-
                     ORY  values  must be one of the values supported for that
                     VCPU value. The supported values are 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and

          NOTE:
              This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Far-
              gate resources; use containerOverrides instead.

          numNodes -> (integer)
              The number of nodes to use with a multi-node parallel job.  This
              value  overrides  the  number of nodes that are specified in the
              job definition. To use this override, you must meet the  follow-
              ing conditions:

              o There  must  be at least one node range in your job definition
                that has an open upper boundary, such as : or n: .

              o The lower boundary of the node range that's specified  in  the
                job  definition  must be fewer than the number of nodes speci-
                fied in the override.

              o The main node index that's specified  in  the  job  definition
                must  be fewer than the number of nodes specified in the over-
                ride.

          nodePropertyOverrides -> (list)
              The node property overrides for the job.

              (structure)
                 The object that represents any node overrides to a job  defi-
                 nition that's used in a  SubmitJob API operation.

                 targetNodes -> (string)
                     The  range of nodes, using node index values, that's used
                     to override. A range of 0:3 indicates  nodes  with  index
                     values  of  0  through 3 . If the starting range value is
                     omitted (:n ), then 0 is used to start the range. If  the
                     ending  range  value  is  omitted (n: ), then the highest
                     possible node index is used to end the range.

                 containerOverrides -> (structure)
                     The overrides that are sent to a node range.

                     vcpus -> (integer)
                        This parameter is deprecated, use resourceRequirements
                        to  override the vcpus parameter that's set in the job
                        definition. It's not supported  for  jobs  running  on
                        Fargate resources. For jobs that run on EC2 resources,
                        it overrides the vcpus parameter set in the job  defi-
                        nition,  but  doesn't  override  any  vCPU requirement
                        specified in the resourceRequirements structure in the
                        job definition. To override vCPU requirements that are
                        specified in the resourceRequirements structure in the
                        job definition, resourceRequirements must be specified
                        in the SubmitJob request, with type set  to  VCPU  and
                        value  set to the new value. For more information, see
                        Can't override job definition resource requirements in
                        the Batch User Guide .

                     memory -> (integer)
                        This parameter is deprecated, use resourceRequirements
                        to override the memory requirements specified  in  the
                        job definition. It's not supported for jobs running on
                        Fargate resources. For jobs that run on EC2 resources,
                        it overrides the memory parameter set in the job defi-
                        nition, but doesn't override  any  memory  requirement
                        that's specified in the resourceRequirements structure
                        in the job definition. To override memory requirements
                        that  are specified in the resourceRequirements struc-
                        ture in the job definition, resourceRequirements  must
                        be  specified  in the SubmitJob request, with type set
                        to MEMORY and value set to the new value. For more in-
                        formation,  see Can't override job definition resource
                        requirements in the Batch User Guide .

                     command -> (list)
                        The command to send to the  container  that  overrides
                        the  default  command from the Docker image or the job
                        definition.

                        (string)

                     instanceType -> (string)
                        The instance type to use  for  a  multi-node  parallel
                        job.

                        NOTE:
                            This  parameter  isn't  applicable  to single-node
                            container jobs or jobs that  run  on  Fargate  re-
                            sources, and shouldn't be provided.

                     environment -> (list)
                        The  environment  variables  to send to the container.
                        You can add new environment variables, which are added
                        to  the  container  at launch, or you can override the
                        existing environment variables from the  Docker  image
                        or the job definition.

                        NOTE:
                            Environment variables cannot start with "AWS_BATCH
                            ". This naming convention is  reserved  for  vari-
                            ables that Batch sets.

                        (structure)
                            A key-value pair object.

                            name -> (string)
                               The name of the key-value pair. For environment
                               variables, this is the name of the  environment
                               variable.

                            value -> (string)
                               The  value  of the key-value pair. For environ-
                               ment variables, this is the value of the  envi-
                               ronment variable.

                     resourceRequirements -> (list)
                        The  type  and amount of resources to assign to a con-
                        tainer. This overrides the settings in the job defini-
                        tion.  The  supported resources include GPU , MEMORY ,
                        and VCPU .

                        (structure)
                            The type and amount of a resource to assign  to  a
                            container.  The  supported resources include GPU ,
                            MEMORY , and VCPU .

                            value -> (string)
                               The quantity of the specified resource  to  re-
                               serve  for the container. The values vary based
                               on the type specified.
                                   type="GPU"

                               The number of physical GPUs to reserve for  the
                               container.  Make  sure  that the number of GPUs
                               reserved for all containers in  a  job  doesn't
                               exceed the number of available GPUs on the com-
                               pute resource that the job is launched on.

                               NOTE:
                                   GPUs aren't available  for  jobs  that  are
                                   running on Fargate resources.

                                   type="MEMORY"

                               The  memory  hard limit (in MiB) present to the
                               container. This parameter is supported for jobs
                               that are running on EC2 resources. If your con-
                               tainer attempts to exceed the memory specified,
                               the  container  is  terminated.  This parameter
                               maps to Memory in the Create a  container  sec-
                               tion  of the Docker Remote API and the --memory
                               option to docker run  .  You  must  specify  at
                               least  4  MiB  of memory for a job. This is re-
                               quired but can be specified in  several  places
                               for  multi-node parallel (MNP) jobs. It must be
                               specified for each node at least once. This pa-
                               rameter  maps  to  Memory  in the Create a con-
                               tainer section of the Docker Remote API and the
                               --memory option to docker run .

                               NOTE:
                                   If  you're trying to maximize your resource
                                   utilization by providing your jobs as  much
                                   memory  as  possible  for  a particular in-
                                   stance type, see Memory management  in  the
                                   Batch User Guide .

                               then value is the hard limit (in MiB), and must
                               match  one of the supported values and the VCPU
                               values must be one of the values supported  for
                               that memory value.

                               The number of vCPUs reserved for the container.
                               This  parameter maps to CpuShares in the Create

                               and  the  --cpu-shares  option  to docker run .
                               Each vCPU is equivalent to  1,024  CPU  shares.
                               For  EC2  resources,  you must specify at least
                               one vCPU. This is required but can be specified
                               in  several  places;  it  must be specified for
                               each node at least once.

                               For jobs that are running on Fargate resources,
                               then value must match one of the supported val-

       --retry-strategy (structure)
          The retry strategy to use for failed jobs from this  SubmitJob oper-
          ation.  When  a  retry  strategy is specified here, it overrides the
          retry strategy defined in the job definition.

          attempts -> (integer)
              The number of times to move a job to the  RUNNABLE  status.  You
              can  specify between 1 and 10 attempts. If the value of attempts
              is greater than one, the job is retried on failure the same num-
              ber of attempts as the value.

          evaluateOnExit -> (list)
              Array  of up to 5 objects that specify the conditions where jobs
              are retried or failed. If this parameter is specified, then  the
              attempts parameter must also be specified. If none of the listed
              conditions match, then the job is retried.

              (structure)
                 Specifies an array of up to 5 conditions to be  met,  and  an
                 action to take (RETRY or EXIT ) if all conditions are met. If
                 none of the  EvaluateOnExit  conditions  in  a  RetryStrategy
                 match, then the job is retried.

                 onStatusReason -> (string)
                     Contains a glob pattern to match against the StatusReason
                     returned for a job. The pattern can  contain  up  to  512
                     characters. It can contain letters, numbers, periods (.),
                     colons (:), and white spaces (including spaces or  tabs).
                     It  can  optionally end with an asterisk (*) so that only
                     the start of the string needs to be an exact match.

                 onReason -> (string)
                     Contains a glob pattern to match against the  Reason  re-
                     turned for a job. The pattern can contain up to 512 char-
                     acters. It can contain  letters,  numbers,  periods  (.),
                     colons  (:), and white space (including spaces and tabs).
                     It can optionally end with an asterisk (*) so  that  only
                     the start of the string needs to be an exact match.

                 onExitCode -> (string)
                     Contains a glob pattern to match against the decimal rep-
                     resentation of the ExitCode returned for a job. The  pat-
                     tern  can  be  up  to 512 characters long. It can contain
                     only numbers, and can end with an asterisk  (*)  so  that
                     only the start of the string needs to be an exact match.

                     The string can contain up to 512 characters.

                 action -> (string)
                     Specifies the action to take if all of the specified con-
                     ditions (onStatusReason , onReason , and onExitCode ) are
                     met. The values aren't case sensitive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attempts=integer,evaluateOnExit=[{onStatusReason=string,onReason=string,onExitCode=string,action=string},{onStatusReason=string,onReason=string,onExitCode=string,action=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attempts": integer,
            "evaluateOnExit": [
              {
                "onStatusReason": "string",

            ]
          }

       --propagate-tags | --no-propagate-tags (boolean)
          Specifies  whether to propagate the tags from the job or job defini-
          tion to the corresponding Amazon ECS task. If no value is specified,
          the tags aren't propagated. Tags can only be propagated to the tasks
          during task creation. For tags with the  same  name,  job  tags  are
          given  priority  over  job  definitions tags. If the total number of
          combined tags from the job and job definition is over 50, the job is
          moved  to  the  FAILED state. When specified, this overrides the tag
          propagation setting in the job definition.

       --timeout (structure)
          The timeout configuration for this   SubmitJob  operation.  You  can
          specify a timeout duration after which Batch terminates your jobs if
          they haven't finished. If a job is terminated due to a  timeout,  it
          isn't retried. The minimum value for the timeout is 60 seconds. This
          configuration overrides any timeout configuration specified  in  the
          job  definition.  For  array  jobs, child jobs have the same timeout
          configuration as the parent job. For more information, see Job Time-
          outs in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

          attemptDurationSeconds -> (integer)
              The  job  timeout time (in seconds) that's measured from the job
              attempt's startedAt timestamp. After  this  time  passes,  Batch
              terminates  your jobs if they aren't finished. The minimum value
              for the timeout is 60 seconds.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attemptDurationSeconds=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attemptDurationSeconds": integer
          }

       --tags (map)
          The tags that you apply to the job request to  help  you  categorize
          and  organize  your resources. Each tag consists of a key and an op-
          tional value. For more information, see Tagging Amazon Web  Services
          Resources in Amazon Web Services General Reference .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

                     image -> (string)
                        The  override of the Docker image that's used to start
                        the container.

                     command -> (list)
                        The command to send to the  container  that  overrides

                        to  the  container at launch. Or, you can override the
                        existing environment variables from the  Docker  image
                        or the job definition.

                        NOTE:
                            Environment variables cannot start with "AWS_BATCH

                        The  type  and amount of resources to assign to a con-
                        tainer. These override the settings in the job defini-
                        tion.  The  supported resources include memory , cpu ,
                        and  nvidia.com/gpu  .  For  more   information,   see
                        Resource management for pods and containers in the Ku-

                            the container is terminated. You must  specify  at
                            least  4  MiB  of  memory for a job. memory can be
                            specified in limits , requests , or both. If  mem-
                            ory  is  specified  in both places, then the value
                            that's specified in limits must be  equal  to  the
                            value that's specified in requests .

                            NOTE:
                               To  maximize your resource utilization, provide
                               your jobs with as much memory as  possible  for
                               the  specific instance type that you are using.

                            container attempts to exceed the memory specified,
                            the  container  is terminated. You must specify at
                            least 4 MiB of memory for a  job.  memory  can  be
                            specified  in limits , requests , or both. If mem-

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
