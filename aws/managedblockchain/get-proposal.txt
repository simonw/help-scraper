GET-PROPOSAL()                                                  GET-PROPOSAL()



NAME
       get-proposal -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns detailed information about a proposal.

       Applies only to Hyperledger Fabric.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-proposal
          --network-id <value>
          --proposal-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --network-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the network for which the proposal is made.

       --proposal-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the proposal.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 (structure)
                     An action to remove a member from  a  Managed  Blockchain
                     network  as  the result of a removal proposal that is AP-
                     PROVED . The member  and  all  associated  resources  are
                     deleted from the network.

                     Applies only to Hyperledger Fabric.

                     MemberId -> (string)
                        The unique identifier of the member to remove.

          ProposedByMemberId -> (string)
              The unique identifier of the member that created the proposal.

          ProposedByMemberName -> (string)
              The name of the member that created the proposal.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the proposal. Values are as follows:

              o IN_PROGRESS  - The proposal is active and open for member vot-
                ing.

              o APPROVED - The proposal was approved with sufficient YES votes
                among  members according to the VotingPolicy specified for the
                Network . The specified proposal actions are carried out.

              o REJECTED - The proposal was  rejected  with  insufficient  YES
                votes  among  members  according to the VotingPolicy specified
                for the Network . The specified ProposalActions are  not  car-
                ried out.

              o EXPIRED - Members did not cast the number of votes required to
                determine the proposal outcome before  the  proposal  expired.
                The specified ProposalActions are not carried out.

              o ACTION_FAILED  -  One or more of the specified ProposalActions
                in a proposal that was approved could not be completed because
                of  an error. The ACTION_FAILED status occurs even if only one
                ProposalAction fails and other actions are successful.

              The date and time that the proposal was created.

          ExpirationDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the proposal expires. This  is  the  Cre-
              ationDate  plus the ProposalDurationInHours that is specified in
              the ProposalThresholdPolicy . After this date and time, if  mem-
              bers have not cast enough votes to determine the outcome accord-
              ing to the voting policy, the proposal is  EXPIRED  and  Actions
              are not carried out.

          OutstandingVoteCount -> (integer)
              The number of votes remaining to be cast on the proposal by mem-
              bers. In other words, the number of members minus the sum of YES
              votes and NO votes.

          Tags -> (map)
