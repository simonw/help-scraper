NAME
       create-proposal -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  proposal  for a change to the network that other members of
       the network can vote on, for example, a proposal to add a new member to
       the network. Any member can create a proposal.

       Applies only to Hyperledger Fabric.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-proposal
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          --network-id <value>
          --member-id <value>
          --actions <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-request-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the operation. An idempotent operation  completes  no
          more  than  one time. This identifier is required only if you make a
          service request directly using an HTTP client. It is generated auto-
          matically if you use an AWS SDK or the AWS CLI.

       --network-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the network for which the proposal is made.

       --member-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier of the member that is creating the proposal.
          This identifier is especially useful for identifying the member mak-
          ing  the  proposal  when  multiple members exist in a single AWS ac-
          count.

       --actions (structure)
          The type of actions proposed, such as inviting a member or  removing
          a member. The types of Actions in a proposal are mutually exclusive.
          For example, a proposal with Invitations actions cannot also contain
          Removals actions.

          Invitations -> (list)
              The actions to perform for an APPROVED proposal to invite an AWS
              account to create a member and join the network.

              (structure)
                 An action to invite a specific AWS account to create a member
                 and  join the network. The InviteAction is carried out when a
                 Proposal is APPROVED .

                 Applies only to Hyperledger Fabric.

                 Principal -> (string)
                     The AWS account ID to invite.

          Removals -> (list)
              The actions to perform for an APPROVED proposal to remove a mem-
              ber  from  the network, which deletes the member and all associ-
              ated member resources from the network.

              (structure)
                 An action to remove a member from a Managed  Blockchain  net-
                 work  as  the result of a removal proposal that is APPROVED .
                 The member and all associated resources are deleted from  the
                 network.

                 Applies only to Hyperledger Fabric.

                 MemberId -> (string)
                     The unique identifier of the member to remove.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Invitations=[{Principal=string},{Principal=string}],Removals=[{MemberId=string},{MemberId=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Invitations": [
              {
                "Principal": "string"
              }
              ...
            ],
            "Removals": [
              {
                "MemberId": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --description (string)
          A  description  for  the proposal that is visible to voting members,
          for example, "Proposal to add Example Corp. as member."

       --tags (map)
          Tags to assign to the proposal. Each tag consists of a key  and  op-
          tional value.

          When  specifying  tags  during  creation,  you  can specify multiple
          key-value pairs in a single request, with an overall maximum  of  50
          tags  added to each resource. If the proposal is for a network invi-
          tation, the invitation inherits the tags added to the proposal.

          For more information about tags, see Tagging Resources in the Amazon
          Managed  Blockchain  Ethereum Developer Guide , or Tagging Resources
          in the Amazon Managed Blockchain Hyperledger Fabric Developer  Guide
          .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ProposalId -> (string)
          The unique identifier of the proposal.
