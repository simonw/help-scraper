OPTIONS
       --client-request-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the operation. An idempotent operation  completes  no
          more  than  one time. This identifier is required only if you make a
          service request directly using an HTTP client. It is generated auto-
          matically if you use an AWS SDK or the AWS CLI.

       --name (string)
          The name of the network.

       --description (string)
          An optional description for the network.

       --framework (string)
          The blockchain framework that the network uses.

          Possible values:

          o HYPERLEDGER_FABRIC

          o ETHEREUM

       --framework-version (string)
          The version of the blockchain framework that the network uses.

       --framework-configuration (structure)
          Configuration properties of the blockchain framework relevant to the
          network configuration.

          Fabric -> (structure)
              Hyperledger  Fabric  configuration  properties  for  a   Managed
              Blockchain network that uses Hyperledger Fabric.

              Edition -> (string)
                 The  edition  of  Amazon  Managed Blockchain that the network
                 uses. For more information,  see  Amazon  Managed  Blockchain
                 Pricing .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Fabric={Edition=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Fabric": {
              "Edition": "STARTER"|"STANDARD"
            }
          }

       --voting-policy (structure)
          The  voting  rules used by the network to determine if a proposal is
          approved.

          ApprovalThresholdPolicy -> (structure)
              Defines the rules for the network for voting on proposals,  such
              as  the  percentage of YES votes required for the proposal to be
              approved and the duration of the proposal. The policy applies to
              all proposals and is specified when the network is created.

              ThresholdPercentage -> (integer)
                 The  percentage  of  votes among all members that must be YES
                 for a proposal to be approved. For example,  a  ThresholdPer-
                 centage  value  of  50 indicates 50%. The ThresholdComparator
                 determines the precise comparison. If  a  ThresholdPercentage
                 value  of 50 is specified on a network with 10 members, along
                 with a ThresholdComparator value of GREATER_THAN , this indi-
                 cates  that  6  YES votes are required for the proposal to be
                 approved.

              ProposalDurationInHours -> (integer)
                 The duration from the time that a proposal is  created  until
                 it  expires.  If  members cast neither the required number of
                 YES votes to approve the proposal nor the number of NO  votes
                 required  to  reject it before the duration expires, the pro-
                 posal is EXPIRED and ProposalActions are not carried out.

              ThresholdComparator -> (string)
                 Determines whether the vote percentage must be  greater  than
                 the  ThresholdPercentage  or must be greater than or equal to
                 the ThreholdPercentage to be approved.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ApprovalThresholdPolicy={ThresholdPercentage=integer,ProposalDurationInHours=integer,ThresholdComparator=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ApprovalThresholdPolicy": {
              "ThresholdPercentage": integer,
              "ProposalDurationInHours": integer,
              "ThresholdComparator": "GREATER_THAN"|"GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL_TO"
            }
          }

       --member-configuration (structure)
          Configuration properties for the first member within the network.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the member.

              An optional description of the member.

          FrameworkConfiguration -> (structure)
              Configuration properties of the blockchain framework relevant to
              the member.

              Fabric -> (structure)
                 Attributes  of  Hyperledger  Fabric for a member on a Managed
                 Blockchain network that uses Hyperledger Fabric.

                 AdminUsername -> (string)
                     The user name for  the  member's  initial  administrative
                     user.

                 AdminPassword -> (string)
                     The  password  for  the  member's  initial administrative

                     long  and  no more than 32 characters. It must contain at
                     least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one
                     digit.  It cannot have a single quotation mark (), a dou-

                 CaLogs -> (structure)
                     Configuration properties for  logging  events  associated
                     with  a member's Certificate Authority (CA). CA logs help
                     you determine when a member in  your  account  joins  the
                     network, or when new peers register with a member CA.

              .

              When  specifying  tags during creation, you can specify multiple
              key-value pairs in a single request, with an overall maximum  of
              50 tags added to each resource.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          KmsKeyArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the customer managed key in
              AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to use  for  encryption  at
              rest  in  the  member.  This parameter is inherited by any nodes
              that this member creates.

              Use one of the following options to specify this parameter:

              o Undefined or empty string - The member uses an AWS  owned  KMS
                key for encryption by default.

              o A  valid  symmetric customer managed KMS key - The member uses
                the specified key for encryption.  Amazon  Managed  Blockchain
                doesn't  support  asymmetric  keys.  For more information, see
                Using symmetric and asymmetric keys in the AWS Key  Management
                Service Developer Guide . The following is an example of a KMS
                key                                                       ARN:

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NetworkId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the network.

       MemberId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the first member within the network.
