NAME
       list-proposals -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of proposals for the network.

       Applies only to Hyperledger Fabric.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-proposals
          --network-id <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --network-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the network.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of proposals to return.

       --next-token (string)
          The  pagination  token that indicates the next set of results to re-
          trieve.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Proposals -> (list)

          (structure)

              ProposalId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the proposal.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the proposal.

              ProposedByMemberId -> (string)
                 The  unique  identifier  of  the member that created the pro-

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the proposal. Values are as follows:

                 o IN_PROGRESS - The proposal is active and  open  for  member
                   voting.

                 o APPROVED  -  The  proposal was approved with sufficient YES
                   votes among members according to the VotingPolicy specified
                   for  the  Network . The specified proposal actions are car-
                   ried out.

                 o REJECTED - The proposal was rejected with insufficient  YES
                   votes among members according to the VotingPolicy specified
                   for the Network . The  specified  ProposalActions  are  not
                   carried out.

                 o EXPIRED - Members did not cast the number of votes required
                   to determine the proposal outcome before the  proposal  ex-
                   pired. The specified ProposalActions are not carried out.

                 o ACTION_FAILED  -  One  or more of the specified ProposalAc-
                   tions in a proposal that was approved  could  not  be  com-

                 The date and time that the proposal was created.

              ExpirationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the proposal expires. This is the Cre-
                 ationDate plus the ProposalDurationInHours that is  specified
                 in the ProposalThresholdPolicy . After this date and time, if
                 members have not cast enough votes to determine  the  outcome
                 according  to  the voting policy, the proposal is EXPIRED and

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the proposal. For more  in-
                 formation  about  ARNs  and their format, see Amazon Resource
                 Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference .

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token that indicates the next set of results  to  re-
          trieve.
