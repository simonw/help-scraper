NAME
       list-nodes -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about the nodes within a network.

       Applies to Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-nodes
          --network-id <value>
          [--member-id <value>]
          [--status <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --network-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the network for which to list nodes.

       --member-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the member who owns the nodes to list.

          Applies  only  to Hyperledger Fabric and is required for Hyperledger
          Fabric.

       --status (string)
          An optional status specifier. If provided, only nodes  currently  in
          this status are listed.

          Possible values:

          o CREATING

          o AVAILABLE

          o UNHEALTHY

          o CREATE_FAILED

          o UPDATING

          o DELETING

          o DELETED

          o FAILED

          o INACCESSIBLE_ENCRYPTION_KEY

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of nodes to list.

       --next-token (string)
          The  pagination  token that indicates the next set of results to re-
          trieve.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Nodes -> (list)
          An  array  of NodeSummary objects that contain configuration proper-
          ties for each node.

          (structure)
              A summary of configuration properties for a node.

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the node.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the node.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the node was created.

              AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                 The Availability Zone in which the node exists.

              InstanceType -> (string)
                 The EC2 instance type for the node.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the node. For more informa-
                 tion  about  ARNs and their format, see Amazon Resource Names
                 (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference .

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token that indicates the next set of results  to  re-
          trieve.
