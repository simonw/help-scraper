DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about the networks in which the current AWS account
       participates.

       Applies to Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-networks
          [--name <value>]
          [--framework <value>]
          [--status <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the network.

       --framework (string)
          An optional framework specifier. If provided, only networks of  this
          framework type are listed.

          Possible values:

          o HYPERLEDGER_FABRIC

          o ETHEREUM

       --status (string)
          An  optional  status specifier. If provided, only networks currently
          in this status are listed.

          Applies only to Hyperledger Fabric.

          Possible values:

          o CREATING

          o AVAILABLE

          o CREATE_FAILED

          o DELETING

          o DELETED

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of networks to list.

       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token that indicates the next set of results  to  re-
          trieve.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Networks -> (list)
          An array of NetworkSummary objects that contain configuration  prop-
          erties for each network.

          (structure)
              A summary of network configuration properties.

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the network.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the network.

              Description -> (string)
                 An optional description of the network.

              Framework -> (string)

              FrameworkVersion -> (string)

                 uses.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status of the network.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the network. For  more  in-
                 formation  about  ARNs  and their format, see Amazon Resource
