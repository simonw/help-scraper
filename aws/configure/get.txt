GET()                                                                    GET()



NAME
       get -

DESCRIPTION
       Get a configuration value from the config file.

       The  aws  configure  get  command  can be used to print a configuration
       value in the AWS config file.  The get command supports  two  types  of
       configuration values, unqualified and qualified config values.

       Note  that aws configure get only looks at values in the AWS configura-
       tion file.  It does not resolve configuration variables specified  any-
       where  else,  including  environment variables, command line arguments,
       etc.

   Unqualified Names
       Every value in the AWS configuration file must be placed in  a  section
       (denoted  by  [section-name]  in the config file).  To retrieve a value
       from the config file, the section name and  the  config  name  must  be
       known.

       An  unqualified  configuration name refers to a name that is not scoped
       to a specific section in the configuration file.  Sections  are  speci-
       fied  by separating parts with the "." character (section.config-name).
       An unqualified name will be scoped to the current profile.   For  exam-
       ple,  aws  configure  get  aws_access_key_id  will retrieve the aws_ac-
       cess_key_id from the current profile,  or the  default  profile  if  no
       profile  is  specified.   You can still provide a --profile argument to
       the aws configure get command.  For example, aws configure  get  region
       --profile testing will print the region value for the testing profile.

   Qualified Names
       A  qualified  name is a name that has at least one "." character in the
       name.  This name provides a way to  specify  the  config  section  from
       which  to  retrieve the config variable.  When a qualified name is pro-
       vided to aws configure get, the currently specified profile is ignored.
       Section names that have the format [profile profile-name] can be speci-
       fied by using the profile.profile-name.config-name syntax, and the  de-
       fault profile can be specified using the default.config-name syntax.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
          aws configure get varname [--profile profile-name]

OPTIONS
       varname (string) The name of the config value to retrieve.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Suppose you had the following config file:

          [default]
          aws_access_key_id=default_access_key
          aws_secret_access_key=default_secret_key

          [profile testing]
          aws_access_key_id=testing_access_key
          aws_secret_access_key=testing_secret_key
          region=us-west-2

       The following commands would have the corresponding output:

          $ aws configure get aws_access_key_id
          default_access_key

          $ aws configure get default.aws_access_key_id
          default_access_key

          $ aws configure get aws_access_key_id --profile testing
          testing_access_key

          $ aws configure get profile.testing.aws_access_key_id
          testing_access_key

          $ aws configure get profile.does-not-exist
          $
          $ echo $?
          1



                                                                         GET()
