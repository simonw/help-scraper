DESCRIBE-EVENTS()                                            DESCRIBE-EVENTS()



NAME
       describe-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  events  related  to DAX clusters and parameter groups. You can
       obtain events specific to a particular DAX cluster or  parameter  group
       by providing the name as a parameter.

       By  default, only the events occurring within the last 24 hours are re-
       turned; however, you can retrieve up to 14 days'  worth  of  events  if
       necessary.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-events is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Events

SYNOPSIS
            describe-events
          [--source-name <value>]
          [--source-type <value>]
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--duration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-name (string)
          The identifier of the event source for  which  events  will  be  re-
          turned.  If  not specified, then all sources are included in the re-
          sponse.

       --source-type (string)
          The event source to retrieve events for. If no value  is  specified,
          all events are returned.

          Possible values:

          o CLUSTER

          o PARAMETER_GROUP

          o SUBNET_GROUP

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The beginning of the time interval to retrieve events for, specified
          in ISO 8601 format.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end of the time interval for which to retrieve events, specified
          in ISO 8601 format.

       --duration (integer)
          The number of minutes' worth of events to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          Provides an identifier to allow retrieval of paginated results.

       Events -> (list)
          An array of events. Each element in the array represents one event.

          (structure)
              Represents a single occurrence of something  interesting  within
              the  system. Some examples of events are creating a DAX cluster,
              adding or removing a node, or rebooting a node.

              SourceName -> (string)
                 The source of the event. For example, if the  event  occurred
                 at the node level, the source would be the node ID.

              SourceType -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  origin of this event - a cluster, a parameter
                 group, a node ID, etc.

              Message -> (string)
                 A user-defined message associated with the event.

              Date -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the event occurred.
