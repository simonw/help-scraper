INCREASE-REPLICATION-FACTOR()                    INCREASE-REPLICATION-FACTOR()



NAME
       increase-replication-factor -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds one or more nodes to a DAX cluster.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            increase-replication-factor
          --cluster-name <value>
          --new-replication-factor <value>
          [--availability-zones <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of the DAX cluster that will receive additional nodes.

       --new-replication-factor (integer)
          The new number of nodes for the DAX cluster.

       --availability-zones (list)
          The Availability Zones (AZs) in which the cluster nodes will be cre-
          ated. All nodes belonging to the cluster are placed in these  Avail-
          ability  Zones.  Use  this  parameter  if you want to distribute the
          nodes across multiple AZs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To increase the replication factor for a DAX cluster

       The following increase-replication-factor example increases the  speci-
       fied DAX cluster's replication factor to 3.

          aws dax increase-replication-factor \
              --cluster-name daxcluster \
              --new-replication-factor 3
