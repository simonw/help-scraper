GET-STATUS()                                                      GET-STATUS()



NAME
       get-status -

DESCRIPTION
       This operation returns information about a job, including where the job
       is in the processing pipeline, the status of the results, and the  sig-
       nature  value  associated with the job. You can only return information
       about jobs you own.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-status
          --job-id <value>
          [--api-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string) A unique identifier which refers to a particular job.

       --api-version (string) Specifies the version of the client tool.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command returns the status the specified job:

          aws importexport get-status  --job-id EX1ID

       The output for the get-status command looks like the following:

       When you ship your device, it will be delivered to a sorting  facility,
       and  then forwarded on to an AWS data center. Note that when you send a
       get-status command, the status of your job will not show as At AWS  un-
       til the shipment has been received at the AWS data center.
