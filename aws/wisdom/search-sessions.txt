SEARCH-SESSIONS()                                            SEARCH-SESSIONS()



NAME
       search-sessions -

DESCRIPTION
       Searches for sessions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       search-sessions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: sessionSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            search-sessions
          --assistant-id <value>
          --search-expression <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --assistant-id (string)
          The identifier of the Wisdom assistant. Can be either the ID or  the
          ARN. URLs cannot contain the ARN.

       --search-expression (structure)
          The search expression to filter results.

          filters -> (list)
              The search expression filters.

              (structure)
                 A search filter.

                 field -> (string)
                     The field on which to filter.

                 operator -> (string)
                     The  operator  to use for comparing the fields value with
                     the provided value.

                 value -> (string)
                     The desired field value on which to filter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          filters=[{field=string,operator=string,value=string},{field=string,operator=string,value=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "filters": [
              {
                "field": "NAME",
                "operator": "EQUALS",
                "value": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          If there are additional results, this is the token for the next  set
          of results.

       sessionSummaries -> (list)
          Summary information about the sessions.

          (structure)
              Summary information about the session.

              assistantArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Wisdom assistant.

              assistantId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the Wisdom assistant.

              sessionArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the session.

              sessionId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the session.
