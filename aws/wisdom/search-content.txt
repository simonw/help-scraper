SEARCH-CONTENT()                                              SEARCH-CONTENT()



NAME
       search-content -

DESCRIPTION
       Searches  for content in a specified knowledge base. Can be used to get
       a specific content resource by its name.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       search-content is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: contentSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            search-content
          --knowledge-base-id <value>
          --search-expression <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --knowledge-base-id (string)
          The  the  identifier  of the knowledge base. Can be either the ID or
          the ARN. URLs cannot contain the ARN.

       --search-expression (structure)
          The search expression to filter results.

          filters -> (list)
              The search expression filters.

              (structure)
                 A search filter.

                 field -> (string)
                     The field on which to filter.

                 operator -> (string)
                     The operator to use for comparing the fields  value  with
                     the provided value.

                 value -> (string)
                     The desired field value on which to filter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          filters=[{field=string,operator=string,value=string},{field=string,operator=string,value=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "filters": [
              {
                "field": "NAME",
                "operator": "EQUALS",
                "value": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       contentSummaries -> (list)
          Summary information about the content.

          (structure)
              Summary information about the content.

              contentArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the content.

              contentId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the content.

              contentType -> (string)
                 The media type of the content.

              knowledgeBaseArn -> (string)

                 A key/value map to store attributes without affecting tagging
                 or recommendations. For example, when synchronizing data  be-
                 tween  an external system and Wisdom, you can store an exter-
                 nal version identifier as metadata to utilize for determining
                 drift.

                 value -> (string)

                 The status of the content.

              tags -> (map)

              title -> (string)
                 The title of the content.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If there are additional results, this is the token for the next  set
          of results.
