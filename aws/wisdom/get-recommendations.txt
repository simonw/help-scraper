GET-RECOMMENDATIONS()                                    GET-RECOMMENDATIONS()



NAME
       get-recommendations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  recommendations for the specified session. To avoid retriev-
       ing   the   same   recommendations    in    subsequent    calls,    use
       NotifyRecommendationsReceived . This API supports long-polling behavior
       with the waitTimeSeconds parameter. Short poll is the default  behavior
       and only returns recommendations already available. To perform a manual
       query against an assistant, use QueryAssistant .

SYNOPSIS
            get-recommendations
          --assistant-id <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          --session-id <value>
          [--wait-time-seconds <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --assistant-id (string)
          The identifier of the Wisdom assistant. Can be either the ID or  the
          ARN. URLs cannot contain the ARN.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return per page.

       --session-id (string)
          The identifier of the session. Can be either the ID or the ARN. URLs
          cannot contain the ARN.

       --wait-time-seconds (integer)
          The duration (in seconds) for which the call waits for a recommenda-
          tion  to  be made available before returning. If a recommendation is
          available, the call returns sooner than WaitTimeSeconds . If no mes-
          sages are available and the wait time expires, the call returns suc-
          cessfully with an empty list.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
