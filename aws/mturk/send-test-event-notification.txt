SEND-TEST-EVENT-NOTIFICATION()                  SEND-TEST-EVENT-NOTIFICATION()



NAME
       send-test-event-notification -

DESCRIPTION
       The  SendTestEventNotification  operation causes Amazon Mechanical Turk
       to send a notification message as if a HIT event occurred, according to
       the  provided notification specification. This allows you to test noti-
       fications without setting up notifications for a real HIT type and try-
       ing  to  trigger  them using the website. When you call this operation,
       the service attempts to send the test notification immediately.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            send-test-event-notification
          --notification <value>
          --test-event-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --notification (structure)
          The notification specification to test. This value is  identical  to
          the value you would provide to the UpdateNotificationSettings opera-
          tion when you establish the notification  specification  for  a  HIT
          type.

          Destination -> (string)
              The target for notification messages. The Destinations format is
              determined by the specified Transport:

              o When Transport is Email, the Destination  is  your  email  ad-
                dress.

              o When Transport is SQS, the Destination is your queue URL.

              o When  Transport  is  SNS,  the  Destination is the ARN of your
                topic.

          Transport -> (string)
              The method Amazon Mechanical Turk uses to send the notification.
              Valid Values: Email | SQS | SNS.

          Version -> (string)
              The  version  of  the  Notification  API  to use. Valid value is
              2006-05-05.

          EventTypes -> (list)
              The list of events that should cause notifications to  be  sent.
              Valid Values: AssignmentAccepted | AssignmentAbandoned | Assign-
              mentReturned | AssignmentSubmitted |  AssignmentRejected  |  As-
              signmentApproved  |  HITCreated  |  HITExtended  | HITDisposed |
              HITReviewable | HITExpired | Ping. The Ping event is only  valid
              for the SendTestEventNotification operation.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Destination=string,Transport=string,Version=string,EventTypes=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Destination": "string",
            "Transport": "Email"|"SQS"|"SNS",
            "Version": "string",
            "EventTypes": ["AssignmentAccepted"|"AssignmentAbandoned"|"AssignmentReturned"|"AssignmentSubmitted"|"AssignmentRejected"|"AssignmentApproved"|"HITCreated"|"HITExpired"|"HITReviewable"|"HITExtended"|"HITDisposed"|"Ping", ...]
          }

       --test-event-type (string)
          The  event  to simulate to test the notification specification. This
          event is included in the test message even if the notification spec-
          ification does not include the event type. The notification specifi-
          cation does not filter out the test event.

          Possible values:

          o AssignmentAccepted

          o AssignmentAbandoned

          o AssignmentReturned

          o AssignmentSubmitted

          o AssignmentRejected

          o AssignmentApproved

          o HITCreated

          o HITExpired

          o HITReviewable

          o HITExtended

          o HITDisposed

          o Ping

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
