UPDATE-NOTIFICATION-SETTINGS()                  UPDATE-NOTIFICATION-SETTINGS()



NAME
       update-notification-settings -

DESCRIPTION
       The  UpdateNotificationSettings operation creates, updates, disables or
       re-enables notifications for a HIT type. If you call the  UpdateNotifi-
       cationSettings operation for a HIT type that already has a notification
       specification, the operation replaces the old specification with a  new
       one. You can call the UpdateNotificationSettings operation to enable or
       disable notifications for the HIT type, without having  to  modify  the
       notification  specification  itself  by providing updates to the Active
       status without specifying a new notification specification.  To  change
       the  Active status of a HIT type's notifications, the HIT type must al-
       ready have a notification specification, or one must be provided in the
       same call to UpdateNotificationSettings .

SYNOPSIS
            update-notification-settings
          --hit-type-id <value>
          [--notification <value>]
          [--active | --no-active]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --hit-type-id (string)
          The ID of the HIT type whose notification specification is being up-
          dated.

       --notification (structure)
          The notification specification for the HIT type.

          Destination -> (string)
              The target for notification messages. The Destinations format is
              determined by the specified Transport:

              o When  Transport  is  Email,  the Destination is your email ad-
                dress.

              o When Transport is SQS, the Destination is your queue URL.

              o When Transport is SNS, the Destination  is  the  ARN  of  your
                topic.

          Transport -> (string)
              The method Amazon Mechanical Turk uses to send the notification.
              Valid Values: Email | SQS | SNS.

          Version -> (string)
              The version of the Notification  API  to  use.  Valid  value  is
              2006-05-05.

          EventTypes -> (list)
              The  list  of events that should cause notifications to be sent.
              Valid Values: AssignmentAccepted | AssignmentAbandoned | Assign-
              mentReturned  |  AssignmentSubmitted  | AssignmentRejected | As-
              signmentApproved | HITCreated  |  HITExtended  |  HITDisposed  |
              HITReviewable  | HITExpired | Ping. The Ping event is only valid
              for the SendTestEventNotification operation.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Destination=string,Transport=string,Version=string,EventTypes=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Destination": "string",
            "Transport": "Email"|"SQS"|"SNS",
            "Version": "string",
            "EventTypes": ["AssignmentAccepted"|"AssignmentAbandoned"|"AssignmentReturned"|"AssignmentSubmitted"|"AssignmentRejected"|"AssignmentApproved"|"HITCreated"|"HITExpired"|"HITReviewable"|"HITExtended"|"HITDisposed"|"Ping", ...]
          }

       --active | --no-active (boolean)
          Specifies whether notifications are sent for HITs of this HIT  type,
          according to the notification specification. You must specify either
          the Notification parameter or the Active parameter for the  call  to
          UpdateNotificationSettings to succeed.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
