LIST-QUALIFICATION-REQUESTS()                    LIST-QUALIFICATION-REQUESTS()



NAME
       list-qualification-requests -

DESCRIPTION
       The ListQualificationRequests operation retrieves requests for Qualifi-
       cations of a particular Qualification type. The owner of the Qualifica-
       tion  type  calls  this operation to poll for pending requests, and ac-
       cepts them using the AcceptQualification operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-qualification-requests is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: QualificationRequests

SYNOPSIS
            list-qualification-requests
          [--qualification-type-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --qualification-type-id (string)
          The ID of the QualificationType.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NumResults -> (integer)
          The number of Qualification requests on this page  in  the  filtered
          results list, equivalent to the number of Qualification requests be-
          ing returned by this call.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the previous response was incomplete (because there is more  data
          to  retrieve),  Amazon Mechanical Turk returns a pagination token in
          the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve the next
          set of results.

       QualificationRequests -> (list)
          The  Qualification request. The response includes one Qualification-
          Request element for  each  Qualification  request  returned  by  the
          query.

          (structure)
              The  QualificationRequest  data structure represents a request a
              Worker has made for a Qualification.

              QualificationRequestId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Qualification request, a unique identifier gen-
                 erated when the request was submitted.

              QualificationTypeId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Qualification type the Worker is requesting, as
                 returned by the CreateQualificationType operation.

              WorkerId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Worker requesting the Qualification.

              Test -> (string)
                 The contents of the Qualification test that was presented  to
                 the Worker, if the type has a test and the Worker has submit-
                 ted answers. This value is identical to the QuestionForm  as-
                 sociated  with  the Qualification type at the time the Worker
                 requests the Qualification.

              Answer -> (string)
                 The Worker's answers for the Qualification type's  test  con-
                 tained  in  a QuestionFormAnswers document, if the type has a
                 test and the Worker has submitted answers. If the Worker does
                 not provide any answers, Answer may be empty.

              SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and time the Qualification request had a status of
                 Submitted. This is either the time the Worker  submitted  an-
                 swers  for  a  Qualification test, or the time the Worker re-
                 quested the Qualification if the Qualification type does  not
                 have a test.
