GET-QUALIFICATION-SCORE()                            GET-QUALIFICATION-SCORE()



NAME
       get-qualification-score -

DESCRIPTION
       The  GetQualificationScore  operation  returns  the value of a Worker's
       Qualification for a given Qualification type.

       To get a Worker's Qualification, you must know  the  Worker's  ID.  The
       Worker's  ID is included in the assignment data returned by the ListAs-
       signmentsForHIT operation.

       Only the owner of a  Qualification  type  can  query  the  value  of  a
       Worker's Qualification of that type.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-qualification-score
          --qualification-type-id <value>
          --worker-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --qualification-type-id (string)
          The ID of the QualificationType.

       --worker-id (string)
          The ID of the Worker whose Qualification is being updated.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
