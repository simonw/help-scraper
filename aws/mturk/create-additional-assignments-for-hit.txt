NAME
       create-additional-assignments-for-hit -

DESCRIPTION
       The  CreateAdditionalAssignmentsForHIT  operation increases the maximum
       number of assignments of an existing HIT.

       To extend the maximum number of assignments, specify the number of  ad-
       ditional assignments.

       NOTE:

          o HITs  created with fewer than 10 assignments cannot be extended to
            have 10 or more assignments. Attempting to add  assignments  in  a
            way  that  brings  the  total number of assignments for a HIT from
            fewer than 10 assignments to 10 or more assignments will result in
            an AWS.MechanicalTurk.InvalidMaximumAssignmentsIncrease exception.

          o HITs  that  were  created before July 22, 2015 cannot be extended.
            Attempting to extend HITs that were created before July  22,  2015
            will  result in an AWS.MechanicalTurk.HITTooOldForExtension excep-
            tion.

SYNOPSIS
            create-additional-assignments-for-hit
          --hit-id <value>
          --number-of-additional-assignments <value>
          [--unique-request-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --hit-id (string)
          The ID of the HIT to extend.

       --number-of-additional-assignments (integer)
          The number of additional assignments to request for this HIT.

       --unique-request-token (string)
          A unique identifier for this request, which allows you to retry  the
          call on error without extending the HIT multiple times. This is use-
          ful in cases such as network timeouts where it is unclear whether or
          not  the call succeeded on the server. If the extend HIT already ex-
          ists in the  system  from  a  previous  call  using  the  same  Uni-
          queRequestToken  , subsequent calls will return an error with a mes-
          sage containing the request ID.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
