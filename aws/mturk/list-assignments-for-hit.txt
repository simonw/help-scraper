LIST-ASSIGNMENTS-FOR-HIT()                          LIST-ASSIGNMENTS-FOR-HIT()



NAME
       list-assignments-for-hit -

DESCRIPTION
       The ListAssignmentsForHIT operation retrieves completed assignments for
       a HIT. You can use this operation to retrieve the results for a HIT.

       You can get assignments for a HIT at any time, even if the HIT  is  not
       yet  Reviewable.  If  a HIT requested multiple assignments, and has re-
       ceived some results but has not yet become Reviewable,  you  can  still
       retrieve the partial results with this operation.

       Use  the AssignmentStatus parameter to control which set of assignments
       for a HIT are returned. The ListAssignmentsForHIT operation can  return
       submitted  assignments  awaiting approval, or it can return assignments
       that have already been approved or rejected. You can set AssignmentSta-
       tus=Approved,Rejected  to  get  assignments  that have already been ap-
       proved and rejected together in one result set.

       Only the Requester who created the HIT can retrieve the assignments for
       that HIT.

       Results  are  sorted  and divided into numbered pages and the operation
       returns a single page of results. You can use the parameters of the op-
       eration to control sorting and pagination.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-assignments-for-hit  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: Assignments

SYNOPSIS
            list-assignments-for-hit
          --hit-id <value>
          [--assignment-statuses <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --hit-id (string)
          The ID of the HIT.

       --assignment-statuses (list)
          The status of the assignments to return: Submitted | Approved |  Re-
          jected

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            Submitted
            Approved
            Rejected

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the previous response was incomplete (because there is more data
          to retrieve), Amazon Mechanical Turk returns a pagination  token  in
          the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve the next
          set of results.

       NumResults -> (integer)
          The number of assignments on the page in the filtered results  list,
          equivalent to the number of assignments returned by this call.

       Assignments -> (list)
          The collection of Assignment data structures returned by this call.

          (structure)
              The  Assignment data structure represents a single assignment of
              a HIT to a Worker. The assignment tracks the Worker's efforts to
              complete the HIT, and contains the results for later retrieval.

              AssignmentId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the assignment.

              WorkerId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Worker who accepted the HIT.

              HITId -> (string)
                 The ID of the HIT.

              AssignmentStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the assignment.

              AutoApprovalTime -> (timestamp)
                 If  results have been submitted, AutoApprovalTime is the date
                 and time the results of the assignment results are considered
                 Approved  automatically if they have not already been explic-
                 itly approved or rejected by the Requester. This value is de-
                 rived from the auto-approval delay specified by the Requester
                 in the HIT. This value is omitted from the assignment if  the
                 Worker has not yet submitted results.

              AcceptTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the Worker accepted the assignment.

              SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
                 If  the  Worker has submitted results, SubmitTime is the date
                 and time the assignment was submitted. This value is  omitted
                 from  the  assignment if the Worker has not yet submitted re-
                 sults.

              ApprovalTime -> (timestamp)
                 If the Worker has submitted results and the Requester has ap-
                 proved the results, ApprovalTime is the date and time the Re-
                 quester approved the results. This value is omitted from  the
                 assignment if the Requester has not yet approved the results.

              RejectionTime -> (timestamp)
                 If the Worker has submitted results and the Requester has re-
                 jected the results, RejectionTime is the date  and  time  the
                 Requester rejected the results.

              Deadline -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time of the deadline for the assignment. This
                 value is derived from the deadline specification for the  HIT
                 and the date and time the Worker accepted the HIT.

              Answer -> (string)
                 The  Worker's  answers  submitted  for the HIT contained in a
                 QuestionFormAnswers document, if the Worker provides  an  an-
                 swer.  If the Worker does not provide any answers, Answer may
                 contain a QuestionFormAnswers  document,  or  Answer  may  be
                 empty.

              RequesterFeedback -> (string)
                 The  feedback string included with the call to the ApproveAs-
                 signment operation or the RejectAssignment operation, if  the
                 Requester  approved  or rejected the assignment and specified
                 feedback.
