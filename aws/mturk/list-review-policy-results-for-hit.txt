NAME
       list-review-policy-results-for-hit -

DESCRIPTION
       The  ListReviewPolicyResultsForHIT operation retrieves the computed re-
       sults and the actions taken in the  course  of  executing  your  Review
       Policies  for  a given HIT. For information about how to specify Review
       Policies when you call CreateHIT, see Review Policies. The  ListReview-
       PolicyResultsForHIT  operation  can  return  results  for  both Assign-
       ment-level and HIT-level review results.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-review-policy-results-for-hit
          --hit-id <value>
          [--policy-levels <value>]
          [--retrieve-actions | --no-retrieve-actions]
          [--retrieve-results | --no-retrieve-results]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --hit-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the HIT to retrieve review results for.

       --policy-levels (list)
          The Policy Level(s) to retrieve review results for - HIT or  Assign-
          ment.  If  omitted, the default behavior is to retrieve all data for
          both policy levels. For a list of all the  described  policies,  see
          Review Policies.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            Assignment
            HIT

       --retrieve-actions | --no-retrieve-actions (boolean)
          Specify if the operation should retrieve a list of the actions taken
          executing the Review Policies and their outcomes.

       --retrieve-results | --no-retrieve-results (boolean)
          Specify if the operation should retrieve a list of the results  com-
          puted by the Review Policies.

       --next-token (string)
          Pagination token

       --max-results (integer)
          Limit the number of results returned.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
