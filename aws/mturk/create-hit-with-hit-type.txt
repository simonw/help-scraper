CREATE-HIT-WITH-HIT-TYPE()                          CREATE-HIT-WITH-HIT-TYPE()



NAME
       create-hit-with-hit-type -

DESCRIPTION
       The  CreateHITWithHITType  operation  creates  a new Human Intelligence
       Task (HIT) using an existing HITTypeID generated by  the  CreateHITType
       operation.

       This is an alternative way to create HITs from the CreateHIT operation.
       This is the recommended best practice for Requesters who  are  creating
       large numbers of HITs.

       CreateHITWithHITType  also  supports  several  ways to provide question
       data: by providing a value for the Question parameter that fully speci-
       fies the contents of the HIT, or by providing a HitLayoutId and associ-
       ated HitLayoutParameters .

       NOTE:
          If a HIT is created with 10 or more maximum assignments, there is an
          additional  fee.  For  more  information, see Amazon Mechanical Turk
          Pricing .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --hit-type-id (string)
          The HIT type ID you want to create this HIT with.

       --max-assignments (integer)
          The number of times the HIT can be accepted and completed before the
          HIT becomes unavailable.

       --lifetime-in-seconds (long)
          An  amount  of  time,  in  seconds, after which the HIT is no longer
          available for users  to  accept.  After  the  lifetime  of  the  HIT
          elapses,  the HIT no longer appears in HIT searches, even if not all
          of the assignments for the HIT have been accepted.

       --question (string)
          The data the person completing the HIT uses to produce the results.

          Constraints: Must be a QuestionForm data structure, an ExternalQues-
          tion  data  structure,  or  an  HTMLQuestion data structure. The XML
          question data must not be larger than 64 kilobytes (65,535 bytes) in
          size, including whitespace.

          Either  a Question parameter or a HITLayoutId parameter must be pro-
          vided.

       --requester-annotation (string)
          An arbitrary data field. The RequesterAnnotation parameter lets your
          application  attach arbitrary data to the HIT for tracking purposes.
          For example, this parameter could be an identifier internal  to  the
          Requester's application that corresponds with the HIT.

          The  RequesterAnnotation  parameter for a HIT is only visible to the
          Requester who created the HIT. It is not shown to the Worker, or any
          other Requester.

          The  RequesterAnnotation parameter may be different for each HIT you
          submit. It does not affect how your HITs are grouped.

       --unique-request-token (string)
          A unique identifier for this request which allows you to  retry  the
          call  on  error  without  creating duplicate HITs. This is useful in
          cases such as network timeouts where it is unclear  whether  or  not
          the  call  succeeded on the server. If the HIT already exists in the
          system from a previous call using the same UniqueRequestToken,  sub-
          sequent  calls will return a AWS.MechanicalTurk.HitAlreadyExists er-
          ror with a message containing the HITId.

          NOTE:
              Note: It is your responsibility to ensure uniqueness of the  to-
              ken.  The  unique token expires after 24 hours. Subsequent calls
              using the same UniqueRequestToken made after the 24  hour  limit
              could create duplicate HITs.

       --assignment-review-policy (structure)
          The  Assignment-level Review Policy applies to the assignments under
          the HIT. You can specify for Mechanical Turk to take various actions

            ]
          }

       --hit-layout-id (string)
          The HITLayoutId allows you to use a  pre-existing  HIT  design  with
          placeholder  values  and create an additional HIT by providing those
          values as HITLayoutParameters.

          Constraints: Either a Question parameter or a HITLayoutId  parameter
          must be provided.

       --hit-layout-parameters (list)
          If  the  HITLayoutId  is  provided,  any  placeholder values must be
          filled in with values using the  HITLayoutParameter  structure.  For
          more information, see HITLayout.

          (structure)
              The  HITLayoutParameter  data structure defines parameter values
              used with a HITLayout. A HITLayout is a reusable Amazon Mechani-
              cal  Turk  project  template  used to provide Human Intelligence
              Task (HIT) question data for CreateHIT.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the parameter in the HITLayout.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value substituted for the  parameter  referenced  in  the
                 HITLayout.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [

              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              A general description of the HIT.

          Question -> (string)
              The data the Worker completing the HIT uses produce the results.
              This  is either either a QuestionForm, HTMLQuestion or an Exter-
              nalQuestion data structure.

          Keywords -> (string)
              One or more words or phrases that describe the HIT, separated by
              commas.  Search  terms similar to the keywords of a HIT are more
              likely to have the HIT in the search results.

          HITStatus -> (string)
              The status of the HIT and its assignments. Valid Values are  As-
              signable | Unassignable | Reviewable | Reviewing | Disposed.

              The amount of time, in seconds, after the Worker submits an  as-
              signment for the HIT that the results are automatically approved
              by Amazon Mechanical Turk. This is the amount of  time  the  Re-
              quester has to reject an assignment submitted by a Worker before
              the assignment is auto-approved and the Worker is paid.

          Expiration -> (timestamp)
              The date and time the HIT expires.

          AssignmentDurationInSeconds -> (long)

              the HIT after accepting it.

          RequesterAnnotation -> (string)
              An  arbitrary  data  field the Requester who created the HIT can
              use. This field is visible only to the creator of the HIT.

          QualificationRequirements -> (list)
              Conditions that a Worker's Qualifications must meet in order  to
              accept  the  HIT. A HIT can have between zero and ten Qualifica-
              tion requirements. All requirements must be met in order  for  a
              Worker to accept the HIT. Additionally, other actions can be re-
              stricted using the ActionsGuarded field on each QualificationRe-
              quirement structure.

              (structure)
                 The QualificationRequirement data structure describes a Qual-
                 ification that a Worker must have before the  Worker  is  al-
                 lowed  to  accept  a  HIT. A requirement may optionally state
                 that a Worker must have the Qualification in order to preview
                 the HIT, or see the HIT in search results.

                 QualificationTypeId -> (string)
                     The ID of the Qualification type for the requirement.

                 Comparator -> (string)
                     The  kind of comparison to make against a Qualification's
                     value. You can compare a Qualification's value to an  In-
                     tegerValue  to  see if it is LessThan, LessThanOrEqualTo,
                     GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqualTo, EqualTo, or NotEqualTo
                     the  IntegerValue. You can compare it to a LocaleValue to
                     see if it is EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the LocaleValue.  You
                     can check to see if the value is In or NotIn a set of In-
                     tegerValue or LocaleValue values. Lastly, a Qualification
                     requirement  can  also  test if a Qualification Exists or
                     DoesNotExist in the user's  profile,  regardless  of  its
                     value.

                 IntegerValues -> (list)
                     The  integer value to compare against the Qualification's
                     value. IntegerValue must not be present if Comparator  is
                     Exists  or DoesNotExist. IntegerValue can only be used if
                     the Qualification type has an integer value; it cannot be
                     used  with  the  Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. When
                     performing a set comparison by using the In or the  NotIn
                     comparator, you can use up to 15 IntegerValue elements in
                     a QualificationRequirement data structure.

                     (integer)

                 LocaleValues -> (list)
                     The locale value to compare against  the  Qualification's
                     value.  The  local value must be a valid ISO 3166 country
                     code or supports ISO 3166-2 subdivisions. LocaleValue can
                     only  be  used with a Worker_Locale QualificationType ID.
                     LocaleValue can only be  used  with  the  EqualTo,  NotE-
                     qualTo,  In,  and  NotIn comparators. You must only use a
                     single LocaleValue element  when  using  the  EqualTo  or
                     NotEqualTo  comparators. When performing a set comparison
                     by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can  use  up
                     to  30 LocaleValue elements in a QualificationRequirement
                     data structure.

                     (structure)
                        The Locale data structure  represents  a  geographical
                        region or location.

                        Country -> (string)
                            The  country  of  the  locale. Must be a valid ISO
                            3166 country code. For example, the code US refers
                            to the United States of America.

                        Subdivision -> (string)
                            The  state  or  subdivision of the locale. A valid
                            ISO 3166-2 subdivision code. For example, the code
                            WA refers to the state of Washington.

                 RequiredToPreview -> (boolean)
                     DEPRECATED:  Use the ActionsGuarded field instead. If Re-
                     quiredToPreview is true, the question data  for  the  HIT
                     will  not  be shown when a Worker whose Qualifications do
                     not meet this requirement tries to preview the HIT.  That
                     is,  a  Worker's  Qualifications must meet all of the re-
                     quirements for which RequiredToPreview is true  in  order
                     to preview the HIT. If a Worker meets all of the require-
                     ments where RequiredToPreview is true (or if there are no
                     such requirements), but does not meet all of the require-
                     ments for the HIT, the Worker will be allowed to  preview
                     the  HIT's  question data, but will not be allowed to ac-
                     cept and complete the HIT. The  default  is  false.  This
                     should not be used in combination with the ActionsGuarded
                     field.

                 ActionsGuarded -> (string)
                     Setting this attribute prevents Workers whose  Qualifica-
                     tions do not meet this QualificationRequirement from tak-
                     ing the specified action. Valid  arguments  include  "Ac-
                     cept"  (Worker cannot accept the HIT, but can preview the
                     HIT and see it in their search  results),  "PreviewAndAc-
                     cept"  (Worker  cannot accept or preview the HIT, but can
                     see the HIT in their search results),  and  "DiscoverPre-
                     viewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept, preview, or see the
                     HIT in their search results). It's possible  for  you  to
                     create  a  HIT  with  multiple  QualificationRequirements
                     (which can have different values  for  the  ActionGuarded
                     attribute). In this case, the Worker is only permitted to
                     perform an action when they have met all QualificationRe-
                     quirements  guarding the action. The actions in the order
                     of least restrictive to most  restrictive  are  Discover,
                     Preview  and  Accept.  For example, if a Worker meets all
                     QualificationRequirements that are  set  to  DiscoverPre-
                     viewAndAccept,  but do not meet all requirements that are
                     set with PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will  be  able
                     to Discover, i.e. see the HIT in their search result, but
                     will not be able to Preview or Accept the  HIT.  Actions-
                     Guarded  should  not  be used in combination with the Re-
                     quiredToPreview field.

          HITReviewStatus -> (string)
              Indicates the review status of the HIT. Valid Values are  NotRe-
              viewed  |  MarkedForReview | ReviewedAppropriate | ReviewedInap-
              propriate.

          NumberOfAssignmentsPending -> (integer)
              The number of assignments for this HIT that are being  previewed
              or  have been accepted by Workers, but have not yet been submit-
              ted, returned, or abandoned.

          NumberOfAssignmentsAvailable -> (integer)
              The number of assignments for this HIT that  are  available  for
              Workers to accept.

          NumberOfAssignmentsCompleted -> (integer)
              The  number  of assignments for this HIT that have been approved
              or rejected.
