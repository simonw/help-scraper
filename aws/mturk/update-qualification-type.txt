UPDATE-QUALIFICATION-TYPE()                        UPDATE-QUALIFICATION-TYPE()



NAME
       update-qualification-type -

DESCRIPTION
       The UpdateQualificationType operation modifies the attributes of an ex-
       isting Qualification type, which is represented by a  QualificationType
       data  structure.  Only the owner of a Qualification type can modify its
       attributes.

       Most attributes of a Qualification type can be changed after  the  type
       has been created. However, the Name and Keywords fields cannot be modi-
       fied. The RetryDelayInSeconds parameter can be  modified  or  added  to
       change  the  delay or to enable retries, but RetryDelayInSeconds cannot
       be used to disable retries.

       You can use this operation to update the test for a Qualification type.
       The test is updated based on the values specified for the Test, TestDu-
       rationInSeconds and AnswerKey parameters. All three parameters  specify
       the  updated  test.  If  you are updating the test for a type, you must
       specify the Test and TestDurationInSeconds  parameters.  The  AnswerKey
       parameter is optional; omitting it specifies that the updated test does
       not have an answer key.

       If you omit the Test parameter, the test for the Qualification type  is
       unchanged.  There  is no way to remove a test from a Qualification type
       that has one. If the type already has a test, you cannot update  it  to
       be  AutoGranted. If the Qualification type does not have a test and one
       is provided by an update, the type will henceforth have a test.

       If you want to update the test duration or answer key for  an  existing
       test  without changing the questions, you must specify a Test parameter
       with the original questions, along with the updated values.

       If you provide an updated Test but no AnswerKey, the new test will  not
       have  an  answer  key. Requests for such Qualifications must be granted
       manually.

       You can also update the AutoGranted and AutoGrantedValue attributes  of
       the Qualification type.

OPTIONS
       --qualification-type-id (string)
          The ID of the Qualification type to update.

       --description (string)
          The new description of the Qualification type.

       --qualification-type-status (string)
          The new status of the Qualification type - Active | Inactive

          Possible values:

          o Active

          o Inactive

       --test (string)
          The  questions  for the Qualification test a Worker must answer cor-
          rectly to obtain a Qualification of this type. If this parameter  is
          specified, TestDurationInSeconds must also be specified.

          Constraints:  Must  not  be longer than 65535 bytes. Must be a Ques-
          tionForm data structure. This parameter cannot be specified if Auto-
          Granted is true.

          Constraints:  None.  If  not  specified,  the Worker may request the
          Qualification without answering any questions.

       --answer-key (string)
          The answers to the Qualification test specified in the Test  parame-
          ter, in the form of an AnswerKey data structure.

       --test-duration-in-seconds (long)
          The  number  of seconds the Worker has to complete the Qualification
          test, starting from the time the Worker requests the Qualification.

       --retry-delay-in-seconds (long)
          The amount of time, in seconds, that Workers  must  wait  after  re-
          questing  a Qualification of the specified Qualification type before
          they can retry the Qualification request. It is not possible to dis-
          able retries for a Qualification type after it has been created with
          retries enabled. If you want to disable retries, you must dispose of
          the  existing retry-enabled Qualification type using DisposeQualifi-
          cationType and then create a new  Qualification  type  with  retries
          disabled using CreateQualificationType.

       --auto-granted | --no-auto-granted (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  requests  for the Qualification type are granted
          immediately, without prompting the Worker with a Qualification test.

          Constraints: If the Test parameter is specified, this parameter can-
          not be true.

       --auto-granted-value (integer)
          The  Qualification value to use for automatically granted Qualifica-
          tions. This parameter is used only if the AutoGranted  parameter  is
          true.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       QualificationType -> (structure)
          Contains a QualificationType data structure.

          QualificationTypeId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the Qualification type. A  Qualification
              type  is given a Qualification type ID when you call the Create-
              QualificationType operation.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time the Qualification type was created.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the Qualification type. The type  name  is  used  to
              identify  the  type,  and to find the type using a Qualification
              type search.

          Description -> (string)
              A long description for the Qualification type.

          Keywords -> (string)
              One or more words  or  phrases  that  describe  theQualification
              type,  separated by commas. The Keywords make the type easier to
              find using a search.

          QualificationTypeStatus -> (string)
              The status of the Qualification  type.  A  Qualification  type's
              status  determines if users can apply to receive a Qualification
              of this type, and if HITs can be created with requirements based
              on this type. Valid values are Active | Inactive.

          Test -> (string)
              The  questions  for  a  Qualification  test associated with this
              Qualification type that a user can take to obtain  a  Qualifica-
              tion of this type. This parameter must be specified if AnswerKey
              is present. A Qualification type cannot have  both  a  specified
              Test parameter and an AutoGranted value of true.

          TestDurationInSeconds -> (long)
              The  amount  of  time, in seconds, given to a Worker to complete
              the Qualification test, beginning from the time the  Worker  re-
              quests the Qualification.

          AnswerKey -> (string)
              The  answers to the Qualification test specified in the Test pa-
              rameter.

          RetryDelayInSeconds -> (long)
              The amount of time, in seconds, Workers must wait  after  taking
              the  Qualification  test  before they can take it again. Workers
              can take a Qualification test multiple times if  they  were  not
              granted  the  Qualification  from  a previous attempt, or if the
              test offers a gradient score and they want a  better  score.  If
              not  specified,  retries  are disabled and Workers can request a
              Qualification only once.

          IsRequestable -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the Qualification type is one that a user  can
              request  through the Amazon Mechanical Turk web site, such as by
              taking a Qualification test. This value is False for  Qualifica-
              tions  assigned  automatically  by  the system. Valid values are
              True | False.

          AutoGranted -> (boolean)
              Specifies that requests for the Qualification type  are  granted
              immediately,  without  prompting the Worker with a Qualification
              test. Valid values are True | False.

          AutoGrantedValue -> (integer)
              The Qualification integer value to use for automatically granted
              Qualifications, if AutoGranted is true. This is 1 by default.
