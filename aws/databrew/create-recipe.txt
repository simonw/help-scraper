SYNOPSIS
            create-recipe
          [--description <value>]
          --name <value>
          --steps <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          A description for the recipe.

       --name (string)
          A  unique  name  for  the  recipe. Valid characters are alphanumeric
          (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), hyphen (-), period (.), and space.

       --steps (list)
          An array containing the steps to be performed by  the  recipe.  Each
          recipe  step consists of one recipe action and (optionally) an array
          of condition expressions.

          (structure)
              Represents a single step from a DataBrew recipe to be performed.

              Action -> (structure)
                 The particular action to be performed in the recipe step.

                 Operation -> (string)
                     The name of a valid DataBrew transformation  to  be  per-
                     formed on the data.

                 Parameters -> (map)
                     Contextual parameters for the transformation.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

              ConditionExpressions -> (list)
                 One  or  more conditions that must be met for the recipe step
                 to succeed.

                 NOTE:
                     All of the conditions in the array must be met. In  other
                     words,  all  of  the  conditions must be combined using a
                     logical AND operation.

                 (structure)
                     Represents an individual condition that evaluates to true
                     or false.

                     Conditions  are  used  with recipe actions. The action is
                     only performed for  column  values  where  the  condition
                     evaluates to true.

                     If  a  recipe  requires more than one condition, then the
                     recipe must  specify  multiple  ConditionExpression  ele-
                     ments. Each condition is applied to the rows in a dataset
                     first, before the recipe action is performed.

                     Condition -> (string)
                        A specific condition to apply to a recipe action.  For
                        more  information,  see  Recipe  structure in the Glue
                        DataBrew Developer Guide .

                     Value -> (string)
                        A value that the condition must evaluate  to  for  the
                        condition to succeed.

                     TargetColumn -> (string)
                        A column to apply this condition to.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Action={Operation=string,Parameters={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string}},ConditionExpressions=[{Condition=string,Value=string,TargetColumn=string},{Condition=string,Value=string,TargetColumn=string}] ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Action": {
                "Operation": "string",
                "Parameters": {"string": "string"
                  ...}
              },
              "ConditionExpressions": [
                {
                  "Condition": "string",
                  "Value": "string",
                  "TargetColumn": "string"
                }
                ...
              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --tags (map)
          Metadata tags to apply to this recipe.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Name -> (string)
          The name of the recipe that you created.
