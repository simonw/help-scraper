              columns  from the dataset. When ProfileColumns is undefined, the
              profile job will profile all supported columns.

              (structure)
                 Selector of a column from a dataset for profile job  configu-
                 ration. One selector includes either a column name or a regu-

                specified in the Size parameter.

          Size -> (long)
              The Size parameter is  only  required  when  the  mode  is  CUS-
              TOM_ROWS.  The  profile  job  is  run on the specified number of
              rows. The maximum value for size is Long.MAX_VALUE.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
