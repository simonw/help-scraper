DESCRIBE-RECIPE()                                            DESCRIBE-RECIPE()



NAME
       describe-recipe -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the definition of a specific DataBrew recipe corresponding to a
       particular version.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-recipe
          --name <value>
          [--recipe-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the recipe to be described.

       --recipe-version (string)
          The recipe version identifier. If this  parameter  isn't  specified,
          then the latest published version is returned.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CreatedBy -> (string)
          The identifier (user name) of the user who created the recipe.

       CreateDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that the recipe was created.

       LastModifiedBy -> (string)
          The identifier (user name) of the user who last modified the recipe.

       LastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that the recipe was last modified.

       ProjectName -> (string)
          The name of the project associated with this recipe.

       PublishedBy -> (string)
          The  identifier  (user  name)  of  the  user  who last published the
          recipe.

       PublishedDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time when the recipe was last published.

       Description -> (string)
          The description of the recipe.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the recipe.

       Steps -> (list)
          One or more steps to be performed by the recipe. Each step  consists
          of  an action, and the conditions under which the action should suc-
          ceed.

          (structure)
              Represents a single step from a DataBrew recipe to be performed.

              Action -> (structure)
                 The particular action to be performed in the recipe step.

                 Operation -> (string)
                     The name of a valid DataBrew transformation  to  be  per-
                     formed on the data.

                 Parameters -> (map)
                     Contextual parameters for the transformation.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

              ConditionExpressions -> (list)
                 One  or  more conditions that must be met for the recipe step
                 to succeed.

                 NOTE:
                     All of the conditions in the array must be met. In  other
                     words,  all  of  the  conditions must be combined using a
                     logical AND operation.

                 (structure)
                     Represents an individual condition that evaluates to true
                     or false.

                     Conditions  are  used  with recipe actions. The action is
                     only performed for  column  values  where  the  condition
                     evaluates to true.

                     If  a  recipe  requires more than one condition, then the
                     recipe must  specify  multiple  ConditionExpression  ele-
                     ments. Each condition is applied to the rows in a dataset
                     first, before the recipe action is performed.

                     Condition -> (string)
                        A specific condition to apply to a recipe action.  For
                        more  information,  see  Recipe  structure in the Glue
                        DataBrew Developer Guide .

                     Value -> (string)
                        A value that the condition must evaluate  to  for  the
                        condition to succeed.

                     TargetColumn -> (string)
                        A column to apply this condition to.

       Tags -> (map)
          Metadata tags associated with this project.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       ResourceArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the recipe.

       RecipeVersion -> (string)
          The recipe version identifier.
