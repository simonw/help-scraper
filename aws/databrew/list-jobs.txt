LIST-JOBS()                                                        LIST-JOBS()



NAME
       list-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all of the DataBrew jobs that are defined.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation  by  providing  the --no-paginate argument.  When using --output
       text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query  ar-
       gument  must  extract  data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Jobs

OPTIONS
       --dataset-name (string)
          The name of a dataset. Using this parameter indicates to return only
          those jobs that act on the specified dataset.

       --project-name (string)
          The name of a project. Using this parameter indicates to return only
          those jobs that are associated with the specified project.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,

                 20,000 for the size parameter.

                 Mode -> (string)
                     A value that determines whether the profile job is run on
                     the entire dataset or a specified number  of  rows.  This
                     value must be one of the following:

                     o FULL_DATASET  -  The  profile  job is run on the entire
                       dataset.

                     o CUSTOM_ROWS - The profile job is run on the  number  of
                       rows specified in the Size parameter.

                 Size -> (long)
                     The Size parameter is only required when the mode is CUS-
                     TOM_ROWS. The profile job is run on the specified  number
                     of rows. The maximum value for size is Long.MAX_VALUE.

                     Long.MAX_VALUE = 9223372036854775807

              ValidationConfigurations -> (list)
                 List  of  validation  configurations  that are applied to the
                 profile job.

                 (structure)
                     Configuration for data quality validation. Used to select
                     the  Rulesets  and Validation Mode to be used in the pro-
                     file job. When ValidationConfiguration is null, the  pro-
                     file job will run without data quality validation.

                     RulesetArn -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) for the ruleset to be
                        validated in the profile job. The TargetArn of the se-
                        lected  ruleset  should  be the same as the Amazon Re-
                        source Name (ARN) of the dataset  that  is  associated
                        with the profile job.

                     ValidationMode -> (string)
                        Mode  of  data  quality  validation.  Default  mode is
                        CHECK_ALL which verifies all rules defined in the  se-
                        lected ruleset.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that you can use in a subsequent call to retrieve the next
          set of results.



                                                                   LIST-JOBS()
