LIST-RECIPES()                                                  LIST-RECIPES()



NAME
       list-recipes -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all of the DataBrew recipes that are defined.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-recipes is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Recipes

SYNOPSIS
            list-recipes
          [--recipe-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --recipe-version (string)
          Return only those recipes with a version identifier of  LATEST_WORK-
          ING  or  LATEST_PUBLISHED . If RecipeVersion is omitted, ListRecipes
          returns all of the LATEST_PUBLISHED recipe versions.

          Valid values: LATEST_WORKING | LATEST_PUBLISHED

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              Steps -> (list)
                 A list of steps that are defined by the recipe.

                 (structure)
                     Represents a single step from a  DataBrew  recipe  to  be
                     performed.

                     Action -> (structure)
                        The  particular  action  to be performed in the recipe
                        step.

                        Operation -> (string)
                            The name of a valid DataBrew transformation to  be
                            performed on the data.

                            value -> (string)

                     ConditionExpressions -> (list)
                        One or more conditions that must be met for the recipe
                        step to succeed.

                        NOTE:
                            All of the conditions in the array must be met. In
                            other  words,  all  of the conditions must be com-
                            bined using a logical AND operation.

                        (structure)
                            Represents an individual condition that  evaluates
                            to true or false.

                            Conditions  are  used with recipe actions. The ac-
                            tion is only performed for column values where the
                            condition evaluates to true.

                            If a recipe requires more than one condition, then
                            the recipe must specify multiple  ConditionExpres-
                            sion  elements.  Each  condition is applied to the
                            rows in a dataset first, before the recipe  action
                            is performed.

                            Condition -> (string)
                               A  specific  condition to apply to a recipe ac-
                               tion. For more information, see  Recipe  struc-
                               ture in the Glue DataBrew Developer Guide .

                            Value -> (string)
                               A value that the condition must evaluate to for
                               the condition to succeed.

                            TargetColumn -> (string)
                               A column to apply this condition to.

              Tags -> (map)
                 Metadata tags that have been applied to the recipe.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              RecipeVersion -> (string)
                 The identifier for the version for the recipe. Must be one of
                 the following:

                 o Numeric  version (X.Y ) - X and Y stand for major and minor
                   version numbers. The maximum length of each  is  6  digits,
                   and  neither  can  be negative values. Both X and Y are re-
                   quired, and "0.0" isn't a valid version.

                 o LATEST_WORKING - the most recent valid version being devel-
                   oped in a DataBrew project.

                 o LATEST_PUBLISHED - the most recent published version.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that you can use in a subsequent call to retrieve the next
          set of results.
