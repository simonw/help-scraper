OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the job to be described.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

                 Configuration  of  statistics  that  are allowed to be run on
                 columns that contain detected entities.  When  undefined,  no
                 statistics  will be computed on columns that contain detected
                 entities.

                 (structure)
                     Configuration of statistics that are allowed to be run on
                     columns  that  contain detected entities. When undefined,
                     no statistics will be computed on  columns  that  contain
                     detected entities.

                     Statistics -> (list)
                        One  or  more  column  statistics to allow for columns
                        that contain detected entities.

                        (string)

       ValidationConfigurations -> (list)
          List of validation configurations that are applied  to  the  profile
          job.

          (structure)
              Configuration  for  data  quality validation. Used to select the
              Rulesets and Validation Mode to be used in the profile job. When
              ValidationConfiguration  is null, the profile job will run with-
              out data quality validation.

              RulesetArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the ruleset  to  be  vali-
                 dated in the profile job. The TargetArn of the selected rule-
                 set should be the same as the Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of
                 the dataset that is associated with the profile job.

              ValidationMode -> (string)
                 Mode  of  data  quality validation. Default mode is CHECK_ALL
                 which verifies all rules defined in the selected ruleset.

       RecipeReference -> (structure)
          Represents the name and version of a DataBrew recipe.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the recipe.

          RecipeVersion -> (string)
              The identifier for the version for the recipe.

       ResourceArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job.

       RoleArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role to  be  as-
          sumed when DataBrew runs the job.

       Tags -> (map)
          Metadata tags associated with this job.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Timeout -> (integer)
          The job's timeout in minutes. A job that attempts to run longer than
          this timeout period ends with a status of TIMEOUT .

       JobSample -> (structure)
          Sample configuration for profile jobs only. Determines the number of
          rows on which the profile job will be executed.

          Mode -> (string)
              A  value  that  determines whether the profile job is run on the
              entire dataset or a specified number of rows. This value must be
              one of the following:

              o FULL_DATASET - The profile job is run on the entire dataset.

              o CUSTOM_ROWS  -  The  profile  job is run on the number of rows
                specified in the Size parameter.

          Size -> (long)
              The Size parameter is  only  required  when  the  mode  is  CUS-
              TOM_ROWS.  The  profile  job  is  run on the specified number of
              rows. The maximum value for size is Long.MAX_VALUE.

              Long.MAX_VALUE = 9223372036854775807



                                                                DESCRIBE-JOB()
