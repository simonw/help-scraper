GET-CLIENT-CERTIFICATES()                            GET-CLIENT-CERTIFICATES()



NAME
       get-client-certificates -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a collection of  ClientCertificate resources.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-client-certificates  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: items

SYNOPSIS
            get-client-certificates
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a list of client certificates

       Command:

          aws apigateway get-client-certificates

       Output:

          {
              "items": [
                  {
                      "pemEncodedCertificate": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- <certificate content> -----END CERTIFICATE-----",
                      "clientCertificateId": "a1b2c3",
                      "expirationDate": 1483556561,
                      "description": "My Client Certificate",
                      "createdDate": 1452020561
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       position -> (string)

       items -> (list)
          The current page of elements from this collection.

          (structure)
              Represents a client certificate used  to  configure  client-side
              SSL  authentication  while  sending  requests to the integration
              endpoint.
                 Client certificates are used to authenticate an  API  by  the
                 backend  server. To authenticate an API client (or user), use
                 IAM roles and policies, a custom   Authorizer  or  an  Amazon
                 Cognito user pool.  Use Client-Side Certificate

              clientCertificateId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the client certificate.

              description -> (string)
                 The description of the client certificate.

              pemEncodedCertificate -> (string)
                 The  PEM-encoded  public key of the client certificate, which
                 can be used to configure certificate  authentication  in  the
                 integration endpoint .

              createdDate -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp when the client certificate was created.

              expirationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp when the client certificate will expire.

              tags -> (map)
                 The collection of tags. Each tag element is associated with a
                 given resource.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)
