GET-USAGE-PLAN-KEYS()                                    GET-USAGE-PLAN-KEYS()



NAME
       get-usage-plan-keys -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets all the usage plan keys representing the API keys added to a spec-
       ified usage plan.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-usage-plan-keys is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: items

SYNOPSIS
            get-usage-plan-keys
          --usage-plan-id <value>
          [--name-query <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --usage-plan-id (string)
          [Required]  The Id of the  UsagePlan resource representing the usage
          plan containing the to-be-retrieved   UsagePlanKey  resource  repre-
          senting a plan customer.

       --name-query (string)
          A  query  parameter  specifying the name of the to-be-returned usage
          plan keys.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the list of API keys associated with a Usage Plan

       Command:

          aws apigateway get-usage-plan-keys --usage-plan-id a1b2c3

OUTPUT
       position -> (string)

       items -> (list)
          The current page of elements from this collection.

          (structure)
              Represents a usage plan key to identify a plan customer.

              To associate an API stage with a selected API  key  in  a  usage
              plan,  you  must create a UsagePlanKey resource to represent the
              selected  ApiKey .

              id -> (string)

              type -> (string)
                 The type of a usage plan key. Currently, the valid  key  type
                 is API_KEY .

              value -> (string)
                 The value of a usage plan key.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of a usage plan key.
