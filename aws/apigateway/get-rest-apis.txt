GET-REST-APIS()                                                GET-REST-APIS()



NAME
       get-rest-apis -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the  RestApis resources for your collection.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-rest-apis  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: items

SYNOPSIS
            get-rest-apis
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a list of REST APIs

       Command:

          aws apigateway get-rest-apis

       Output:

          {
              "items": [
                  {
                      "createdDate": 1438884790,
                      "id": "12s44z21rb",
                      "name": "My First API"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       position -> (string)

       items -> (list)
          The current page of elements from this collection.

          (structure)
              Represents a REST API.
                 Create an API

              id -> (string)
                 The API's identifier. This identifier is unique across all of
                 your APIs in API Gateway.

              name -> (string)
                 The API's name.

              description -> (string)
                 The API's description.

              createdDate -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp when the API was created.

              version -> (string)
                 A version identifier for the API.

              warnings -> (list)
                 The  warning  messages reported when failonwarnings is turned
                 on during API import.

                 (string)

              binaryMediaTypes -> (list)
                 The list of binary media types supported by the  RestApi . By
                 default,  the   RestApi supports only UTF-8-encoded text pay-
                 loads.

                 (string)

              minimumCompressionSize -> (integer)
                 A nullable integer that is used to enable  compression  (with
                 non-negative  between  0 and 10485760 (10M) bytes, inclusive)
                 or disable compression (with a null value) on  an  API.  When
                 compression  is  enabled, compression or decompression is not
                 applied on the payload if the payload size  is  smaller  than
                 this  value.  Setting  it  to zero allows compression for any
                 payload size.

              apiKeySource -> (string)
                 The source of the API key for metering requests according  to
                 a usage plan. Valid values are:

                 o HEADER  to  read the API key from the X-API-Key header of a
                   request.

                 o AUTHORIZER to read the API key from the  UsageIdentifierKey
                   from a custom authorizer.

              endpointConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The  endpoint configuration of this  RestApi showing the end-
                 point types of the API.

                 types -> (list)
                     A list of endpoint types of an API (  RestApi  )  or  its
                     custom  domain name ( DomainName ). For an edge-optimized
                     API and its custom domain  name,  the  endpoint  type  is
                     "EDGE"  .  For a regional API and its custom domain name,
                     the endpoint type is REGIONAL . For a  private  API,  the
                     endpoint type is PRIVATE .

                     (string)
                        The  endpoint  type.  The  valid  values  are EDGE for
                        edge-optimized API setup, most suitable for mobile ap-
                        plications;  REGIONAL for regional API endpoint setup,
                        most suitable for calling from AWS Region; and PRIVATE
                        for private APIs.

                 vpcEndpointIds -> (list)
                     A  list  of  VpcEndpointIds of an API ( RestApi ) against
                     which to create Route53 ALIASes. It is only supported for
                     PRIVATE endpoint type.

                     (string)

              policy -> (string)
                 A  stringified  JSON  policy  document  that  applies to this
                 RestApi regardless of the caller and  Method configuration.

              tags -> (map)
                 The collection of tags. Each tag element is associated with a
                 given resource.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              disableExecuteApiEndpoint -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  clients  can invoke your API by using the
                 default execute-api endpoint. By default, clients can  invoke
                 your          API          with          the          default
                 https://{api_id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com endpoint.
                 To  require  that  clients use a custom domain name to invoke
                 your API, disable the default endpoint.
