GET-DOMAIN-NAMES()                                          GET-DOMAIN-NAMES()



NAME
       get-domain-names -

DESCRIPTION
       Represents a collection of  DomainName resources.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-domain-names  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: items

SYNOPSIS
            get-domain-names
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a list of custom domain names

       Command:

          aws apigateway get-domain-names

       Output:

          {
              "items": [
                  {
                      "distributionDomainName": "d9511k3l09bkd.cloudfront.net",
                      "certificateUploadDate": 1452812505,
                      "certificateName": "my_custom_domain-certificate",
                      "domainName": "subdomain.domain.tld"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       position -> (string)

       items -> (list)
          The current page of elements from this collection.

          (structure)
              Represents  a custom domain name as a user-friendly host name of
              an API ( RestApi ).

              When you deploy an API, API Gateway creates a default host  name
              for   the   API.   This   default   API  host  name  is  of  the
              {restapi-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com format. With the
              default  host  name, you can access the API's root resource with
              the  URL  of   https://{restapi-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazon-
              aws.com/{stage}/  .  When  you  set  up  a custom domain name of
              apis.example.com for this API, you can then access the same  re-
              source  using  the  URL of the https://apis.examples.com/myApi ,
              where myApi is the base path mapping ( BasePathMapping ) of your
              API under the custom domain name.

              certificateName -> (string)
                 The name of the certificate that will be used  by  edge-opti-
                 mized endpoint for this domain name.

              certificateArn -> (string)
                 The reference to an AWS-managed certificate that will be used
                 by edge-optimized endpoint for this domain name. AWS Certifi-
                 cate Manager is the only supported source.

              certificateUploadDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp when the certificate that was used by edge-op-
                 timized endpoint for this domain name was uploaded.

              regionalDomainName -> (string)
                 The domain name associated with  the  regional  endpoint  for
                 this  custom  domain  name.  You  set  up this association by
                 adding a DNS record that points the  custom  domain  name  to
                 this  regional  domain  name. The regional domain name is re-
                 turned by API Gateway when you create a regional endpoint.

              regionalHostedZoneId -> (string)
                 The region-specific Amazon Route 53 Hosted Zone ID of the re-
                 gional  endpoint. For more information, see Set up a Regional
                 Custom Domain Name and AWS  Regions  and  Endpoints  for  API
                 Gateway .

              regionalCertificateName -> (string)
                 The  name of the certificate that will be used for validating
                 the regional domain name.

              regionalCertificateArn -> (string)
                 The reference to an AWS-managed certificate that will be used
                 for validating the regional domain name. AWS Certificate Man-
                 ager is the only supported source.

              distributionDomainName -> (string)
                 The domain name of the Amazon CloudFront distribution associ-
                 ated  with this custom domain name for an edge-optimized end-
                 point. You set up this association when adding a  DNS  record
                 pointing  the  custom  domain name to this distribution name.
                 For more information about CloudFront distributions, see  the
                 Amazon CloudFront documentation .

              distributionHostedZoneId -> (string)
                 The  region-agnostic  Amazon  Route  53 Hosted Zone ID of the
                 edge-optimized endpoint. The valid  value  is  Z2FDTNDATAQYW2
                 for  all  the regions. For more information, see Set up a Re-
                 gional Custom Domain Name and AWS Regions and  Endpoints  for
                 API Gateway .

              endpointConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The  endpoint  configuration  of this  DomainName showing the
                 endpoint types of the domain name.

                 types -> (list)
                     A list of endpoint types of an API (  RestApi  )  or  its
                     custom  domain name ( DomainName ). For an edge-optimized
                     API and its custom domain  name,  the  endpoint  type  is
                     "EDGE"  .  For a regional API and its custom domain name,
                     the endpoint type is REGIONAL . For a  private  API,  the
                     endpoint type is PRIVATE .

                     (string)
                        The  endpoint  type.  The  valid  values  are EDGE for
                        edge-optimized API setup, most suitable for mobile ap-
                        plications;  REGIONAL for regional API endpoint setup,
                        most suitable for calling from AWS Region; and PRIVATE
                        for private APIs.

                 vpcEndpointIds -> (list)
                     A  list  of  VpcEndpointIds of an API ( RestApi ) against
                     which to create Route53 ALIASes. It is only supported for
                     PRIVATE endpoint type.

                     (string)

              domainNameStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the  DomainName migration. The valid values are
                 AVAILABLE , UPDATING  ,  PENDING_CERTIFICATE_REIMPORT  ,  and
                 PENDING_OWNERSHIP_VERIFICATION  . If the status is UPDATING ,
                 the domain cannot be modified further until the existing  op-
                 eration  is  complete. If it is AVAILABLE , the domain can be
                 updated.

              domainNameStatusMessage -> (string)
                 An optional  text  message  containing  detailed  information
                 about status of the  DomainName migration.

              securityPolicy -> (string)
                 The Transport Layer Security (TLS) version + cipher suite for
                 this  DomainName . The valid values are TLS_1_0 and TLS_1_2 .

              tags -> (map)
                 The collection of tags. Each tag element is associated with a
                 given resource.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              mutualTlsAuthentication -> (structure)
                 The  mutual TLS authentication configuration for a custom do-
                 main name. If specified, API Gateway performs two-way authen-
                 tication  between  the  client  and  the server. Clients must
                 present a trusted certificate to access your API.

                 truststoreUri -> (string)
                     An Amazon S3 URL that specifies the truststore for mutual
                     TLS authentication, for example s3://bucket-name/key-name
                     . The truststore can contain certificates from public  or
                     private  certificate  authorities.  To  update the trust-
                     store, upload a new version to S3, and then  update  your
                     custom  domain name to use the new version. To update the
                     truststore, you must have permissions to  access  the  S3
                     object.

                 truststoreVersion -> (string)
                     The  version  of  the S3 object that contains your trust-
                     store. To specify a version, you must have versioning en-
                     abled for the S3 bucket.

                 truststoreWarnings -> (list)
                     A  list  of  warnings that API Gateway returns while pro-
                     cessing your  truststore.  Invalid  certificates  produce
                     warnings.  Mutual  TLS is still enabled, but some clients
                     might not be able to access your API.  To  resolve  warn-
                     ings,  upload a new truststore to S3, and then update you
                     domain name to use the new version.

                     (string)

              ownershipVerificationCertificateArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the public certificate issued by ACM  to  validate
                 ownership of your custom domain. Only required when configur-
                 ing mutual TLS and using an ACM imported or private  CA  cer-
                 tificate ARN as the regionalCertificateArn.
