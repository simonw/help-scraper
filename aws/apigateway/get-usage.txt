GET-USAGE()                                                        GET-USAGE()



NAME
       get-usage -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the usage data of a usage plan in a specified time interval.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-usage is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation  by  providing  the --no-paginate argument.  When using --output
       text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query  ar-
       gument  must  extract  data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: items

SYNOPSIS
            get-usage
          --usage-plan-id <value>
          [--key-id <value>]
          --start-date <value>
          --end-date <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --usage-plan-id (string)
          The Id of the usage plan associated with the usage data.

       --key-id (string)
          The Id of the API key associated with the resultant usage data.

       --start-date (string)
          The starting date (e.g., 2016-01-01) of the usage data.

       --end-date (string)
          The ending date (e.g., 2016-12-31) of the usage data.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the usage details for a Usage Plan

       Command:

          aws apigateway get-usage --usage-plan-id a1b2c3 --start-date "2016-08-16" --end-date "2016-08-17"

OUTPUT
       usagePlanId -> (string)
          The plan Id associated with this usage data.

       startDate -> (string)
          The starting date of the usage data.

       endDate -> (string)
          The ending date of the usage data.

       position -> (string)

       items -> (map)
          The usage data, as daily logs of used and remaining quotas, over the
          specified  time  interval indexed over the API keys in a usage plan.
          For example, {..., "values" : { "{api_key}" : [ [0, 100], [10,  90],
          [100,  10]]}  ,  where {api_key} stands for an API key value and the
          daily log entry is of the format [used quota, remaining quota] .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (list)
                 (long)



                                                                   GET-USAGE()
