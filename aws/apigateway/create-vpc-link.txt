NAME
       create-vpc-link -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a VPC link, under the caller's account in a selected region, in
       an asynchronous operation that typically takes 2-4 minutes to  complete
       and  become operational. The caller must have permissions to create and
       update VPC Endpoint services.

SYNOPSIS
            create-vpc-link
          --name <value>
          [--description <value>]
          --target-arns <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          [Required] The name used to label and identify the VPC link.

       --description (string)
          The description of the VPC link.

       --target-arns (list)
          [Required] The ARN of the network load balancer of the VPC  targeted
          by the VPC link. The network load balancer must be owned by the same
          AWS account of the API owner.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (map)
          The  key-value  map  of  strings.  The  valid   character   set   is
          [a-zA-Z+-=._:/].  The  tag  key can be up to 128 characters and must
          not start with aws: . The tag value can be up to 256 characters.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       id -> (string)
          The  identifier  of  the  VpcLink . It is used in an  Integration to
          reference this  VpcLink .

       name -> (string)
          The name used to label and identify the VPC link.

       description -> (string)
          The description of the VPC link.

       targetArns -> (list)
          The ARN of the network load balancer of the VPC targeted by the  VPC
