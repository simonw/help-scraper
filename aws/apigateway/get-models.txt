GET-MODELS()                                                      GET-MODELS()



NAME
       get-models -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes existing  Models defined for a  RestApi resource.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-models  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: items

SYNOPSIS
            get-models
          --rest-api-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          [Required] The string identifier of the associated  RestApi .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a list of models for a REST API

       Command:

          aws apigateway get-models --rest-api-id 1234123412

       Output:

          {
              "items": [
                  {
                      "description": "This is a default error schema model",
                      "schema": "{\n  \"$schema\" : \"http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#\",\n  \"title\" : \"Error Schema\",\n  \"type\" : \"object\",\n  \"properties\" : {\n    \"message\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" }\n  }\n}",
                      "contentType": "application/json",
                      "id": "7tpbze",
                      "name": "Error"
                  },
                  {
                      "description": "This is a default empty schema model",
                      "schema": "{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#\",\n  \"title\" : \"Empty Schema\",\n  \"type\" : \"object\"\n}",
                      "contentType": "application/json",
                      "id": "etd5w5",
                      "name": "Empty"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       position -> (string)

       items -> (list)
          The current page of elements from this collection.

          (structure)
              Represents  the data structure of a method's request or response
              payload.

              A request model defines the data structure  of  the  client-sup-
              plied  request payload. A response model defines the data struc-
              ture of the response payload returned by the back end.  Although
              not required, models are useful for mapping payloads between the
              front end and back end.

              A model is used for generating an API's SDK, validating the  in-
              put request body, and creating a skeletal mapping template.

              id -> (string)
                 The identifier for the model resource.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the model. Must be an alphanumeric string.

              description -> (string)
                 The description of the model.

              schema -> (string)
                 The  schema  for the model. For application/json models, this
                 should be JSON schema draft 4  model.  Do  not  include  "*/"
                 characters  in the description of any properties because such
                 "*/" characters may be interpreted as the closing marker  for
                 comments in some languages, such as Java or JavaScript, caus-
                 ing the installation of your API's SDK generated by API Gate-
                 way to fail.

              contentType -> (string)
                 The content-type for the model.
