NAME
       get-deployment -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about a  Deployment resource.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-deployment
          --rest-api-id <value>
          --deployment-id <value>
          [--embed <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          [Required] The string identifier of the associated  RestApi .

       --deployment-id (string)
          [Required]  The identifier of the  Deployment resource to get infor-
          mation about.

       --embed (list)
          A query parameter to retrieve the specified  embedded  resources  of
          the  returned   Deployment  resource  in the response. In a REST API
          call, this embed  parameter  value  is  a  list  of  comma-separated
          strings,   as   in  GET  /restapis/{restapi_id}/deployments/{deploy-
          ment_id}?embed=var1,var2 . The SDK and other platform-dependent  li-
          braries  might  use a different format for the list. Currently, this
          request supports only retrieval of the  embedded  API  summary  this
          way.  Hence,  the  parameter value must be a single-valued list con-
          taining   only   the   "apisummary"   string.   For   example,   GET
          /restapis/{restapi_id}/deployments/{deployment_id}?embed=apisummary
          .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
