DESCRIPTION

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-documentation-part
          --rest-api-id <value>
          --documentation-part-id <value>
          [--patch-operations <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          [Required] The string identifier of the associated  RestApi .

       --documentation-part-id (string)
          [Required] The identifier of the to-be-updated documentation part.

       --patch-operations (list)
          A  list of update operations to be applied to the specified resource
          and in the order specified in this list.

          (structure)
              A single patch operation to apply  to  the  specified  resource.
              Please refer to http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902#section-4 for
              an explanation of how each operation is used.

              op -> (string)
                 An update operation to be performed with this PATCH  request.
                 The  valid  value can be add , remove , replace or copy . Not
                 all valid operations are supported for a given resource. Sup-
                 port  of  the operations depends on specific operational con-
                 texts. Attempts to apply an unsupported operation  on  a  re-
                 source will return an error message.

              path -> (string)
                 The  op  operation's  target, as identified by a JSON Pointer
                 value that references a  location  within  the  targeted  re-
                 source. For example, if the target resource has an updateable
                 property of {"name":"value"} , the path for this property  is
                 /name  .  If  the name property value is a JSON object (e.g.,
                 {"name": {"child/name": "child-value"}} ), the path  for  the
                 child/name  property  will  be  /name/child~1name . Any slash
                 ("/") character appearing in path names must be escaped  with
                 "~1",  as  shown  in the example above. Each op operation can
                 have only one path associated with it.

              value -> (string)
                 The new target value of the update operation. It is  applica-
                 ble  for  the add or replace operation. When using AWS CLI to
                 update a property of a JSON value, enclose  the  JSON  object
                 with  a  pair of single quotes in a Linux shell, e.g., '{"a":
                 ...}'. In a Windows shell, see Using JSON for Parameters .

              from -> (string)
                 The  copy  update  operation's  source  as  identified  by  a
                 JSON-Pointer  value  referencing the location within the tar-
                 geted resource to copy the value from. For example,  to  pro-
                 mote  a  canary deployment, you copy the canary deployment ID
                 to the affiliated deployment ID by calling a PATCH request on
                 a   Stage  resource  with  "op":"copy"  , "from":"/canarySet-
                 tings/deploymentId" and "path":"/deploymentId" .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          op=string,path=string,value=string,from=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "op": "add"|"remove"|"replace"|"move"|"copy"|"test",
              "path": "string",
              "value": "string",
              "from": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       id -> (string)
          The  DocumentationPart identifier, generated by API Gateway when the
          DocumentationPart is created.

       location -> (structure)
          The  location  of the API entity to which the documentation applies.
          Valid fields depend on the targeted API entity type. All  the  valid
          location  fields  are  not  required. If not explicitly specified, a
          valid location field is treated as a wildcard and  associated  docu-
          mentation  content  may  be  inherited  by matching entities, unless
          overridden.

          type -> (string)
              [Required] The type of API entity  to  which  the  documentation
              content applies. Valid values are API , AUTHORIZER , MODEL , RE-
              SOURCE  ,  METHOD  ,  PATH_PARAMETER  ,  QUERY_PARAMETER  ,  RE-
              QUEST_HEADER  ,  REQUEST_BODY , RESPONSE , RESPONSE_HEADER , and
              RESPONSE_BODY . Content inheritance does not apply to any entity
              of the API , AUTHORIZER , METHOD , MODEL , REQUEST_BODY , or RE-
              SOURCE type.

          path -> (string)
              The URL path of the target. It is a valid field for the API  en-
              tity types of RESOURCE , METHOD , PATH_PARAMETER , QUERY_PARAME-
              TER , REQUEST_HEADER , REQUEST_BODY , RESPONSE , RESPONSE_HEADER
              ,  and  RESPONSE_BODY  . The default value is / for the root re-
              source. When an applicable child entity inherits the content  of
              another entity of the same type with more general specifications
              of the other location attributes, the child entity's path attri-
              bute must match that of the parent entity as a prefix.

          method -> (string)
              The  HTTP  verb of a method. It is a valid field for the API en-
              tity types of METHOD , PATH_PARAMETER ,  QUERY_PARAMETER  ,  RE-
              QUEST_HEADER  ,  REQUEST_BODY , RESPONSE , RESPONSE_HEADER , and
              RESPONSE_BODY . The default value is * for any method.  When  an
              applicable child entity inherits the content of an entity of the
              same type with more general specifications of the other location
              attributes,  the child entity's method attribute must match that
              of the parent entity exactly.

          statusCode -> (string)
              The HTTP status code of a response. It is a valid field for  the
              API  entity  types  of  RESPONSE  ,  RESPONSE_HEADER  ,  and RE-
              SPONSE_BODY . The default value is * for any status  code.  When
              an  applicable child entity inherits the content of an entity of
              the same type with more general specifications of the other  lo-
              cation  attributes, the child entity's statusCode attribute must
              match that of the parent entity exactly.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the targeted API entity. It is a valid and  required
              field  for the API entity types of AUTHORIZER , MODEL , PATH_PA-
              RAMETER , QUERY_PARAMETER , REQUEST_HEADER  ,  REQUEST_BODY  and
              RESPONSE_HEADER  .  It  is an invalid field for any other entity
              type.

       properties -> (string)
          A content map of API-specific key-value pairs  describing  the  tar-
          geted API entity. The map must be encoded as a JSON string, e.g., "{
          \"description\": \"The API does ...\" }"  .  Only  OpenAPI-compliant
          documentation-related  fields  from  the  propertiesmap are exported
          and, hence, published as part of the API entity  definitions,  while
          the original documentation parts are exported in a OpenAPI extension
          of x-amazon-apigateway-documentation .
