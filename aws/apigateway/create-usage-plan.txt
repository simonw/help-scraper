SYNOPSIS
            create-usage-plan
          --name <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--api-stages <value>]
          [--throttle <value>]
          [--quota <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          [Required] The name of the usage plan.

       --description (string)
          The description of the usage plan.

       --api-stages (list)
          The associated API stages of the usage plan.

          (structure)
              API stage name of the associated API stage in a usage plan.

              apiId -> (string)
                 API Id of the associated API stage in a usage plan.

              stage -> (string)
                 API stage name of the associated API stage in a usage plan.

              throttle -> (map)
                 Map containing method level throttling  information  for  API
                 stage in a usage plan.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     The API request rate limits.

                     burstLimit -> (integer)
                        The  API  target request burst rate limit. This allows
                        more requests through for a period of  time  than  the
                        target rate limit.

                     rateLimit -> (double)
                        The API target request rate limit.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          apiId=string,stage=string,throttle={KeyName1={burstLimit=integer,rateLimit=double},KeyName2={burstLimit=integer,rateLimit=double}} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "apiId": "string",
              "stage": "string",
              "throttle": {"string": {
                    "burstLimit": integer,
                    "rateLimit": double
                  }
                ...}
            }
            ...
          ]

       --throttle (structure)
          The throttling limits of the usage plan.

          burstLimit -> (integer)
              The  API  target  request burst rate limit. This allows more re-
              quests through for a period of time than the target rate limit.

          rateLimit -> (double)
              The API target request rate limit.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          burstLimit=integer,rateLimit=double

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "burstLimit": integer,
            "rateLimit": double
          }

       --quota (structure)
          The quota of the usage plan.

          limit -> (integer)
              The target maximum number of requests that  can  be  made  in  a
              given time period.

          offset -> (integer)
              The  day that a time period starts. For example, with a time pe-
              riod of WEEK , an offset of 0 starts on Sunday, and an offset of
              1 starts on Monday.

          period -> (string)
              The  time  period  in  which the limit applies. Valid values are
              "DAY", "WEEK" or "MONTH".

       Shorthand Syntax:

          limit=integer,offset=integer,period=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "limit": integer,
            "offset": integer,
            "period": "DAY"|"WEEK"|"MONTH"
          }

       --tags (map)
          The  key-value  map  of  strings.  The  valid   character   set   is
          [a-zA-Z+-=._:/].  The  tag  key can be up to 128 characters and must
          not start with aws: . The tag value can be up to 256 characters.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
