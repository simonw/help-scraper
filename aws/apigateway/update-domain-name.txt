OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The name of the DomainName resource to be changed.

       --patch-operations (list)
          For more information about supported patch operations, see Patch Op-
          erations .

          (structure)
              For more information about supported patch operations, see Patch
              Operations .

              op -> (string)
                 An  update operation to be performed with this PATCH request.
                 The valid value can be add, remove, replace or copy. Not  all
                 valid  operations are supported for a given resource. Support
                 of the operations depends on specific  operational  contexts.
                 Attempts to apply an unsupported operation on a resource will
                 return an error message..

              path -> (string)
                 The op operation's target, as identified by  a  JSON  Pointer
                 value  that  references  a  location  within the targeted re-
                 source. For example, if the target resource has an updateable
                 property  of  {"name":"value"}, the path for this property is
                 /name. If the name property value is  a  JSON  object  (e.g.,
                 {"name":  {"child/name":  "child-value"}}),  the path for the
                 child/name property  will  be  /name/child~1name.  Any  slash
                 ("/")  character appearing in path names must be escaped with
                 "~1", as shown in the example above. Each  op  operation  can
                 have only one path associated with it.

              value -> (string)
                 The  new target value of the update operation. It is applica-
                 ble for the add or replace operation. When using AWS  CLI  to
                 update  a  property  of a JSON value, enclose the JSON object
                 with a pair of single quotes in a Linux shell,  e.g.,  '{"a":
                 ...}'.

              from -> (string)
                 The  copy  update  operation's  source  as  identified  by  a
                 JSON-Pointer value referencing the location within  the  tar-
                 geted  resource  to copy the value from. For example, to pro-
                 mote a canary deployment, you copy the canary  deployment  ID
                 to the affiliated deployment ID by calling a PATCH request on
                 a  Stage  resource  with   "op":"copy",   "from":"/canarySet-
                 tings/deploymentId" and "path":"/deploymentId".

       Shorthand Syntax:

          op=string,path=string,value=string,from=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "op": "add"|"remove"|"replace"|"move"|"copy"|"test",
              "path": "string",
              "value": "string",
              "from": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To change the certificate name for a custom domain name

       The following update-domain-name example changes the  certificate  name
       for a custom domain.

          aws apigateway update-domain-name \
              --domain-name api.domain.tld \
              --patch-operations op='replace',path='/certificateArn',value='arn:aws:acm:us-west-2:111122223333:certificate/CERTEXAMPLE123EXAMPLE'

       Output:

          {
              "domainName": "api.domain.tld",
              "distributionDomainName": "d123456789012.cloudfront.net",
              "certificateArn": "arn:aws:acm:us-west-2:111122223333:certificate/CERTEXAMPLE123EXAMPLE",
              "certificateUploadDate": 1462565487
          }

          ample.com .

       certificateName -> (string)
          The name of the certificate that will be used by edge-optimized end-
          point for this domain name.

       certificateArn -> (string)
          The reference to an Amazon  Web  Services-managed  certificate  that

          The  domain name associated with the regional endpoint for this cus-
          tom domain name. You set up this association by adding a DNS  record
          that points the custom domain name to this regional domain name. The
          regional domain name is returned by API Gateway when  you  create  a
          regional endpoint.

       distributionDomainName -> (string)
          The domain name of the  Amazon  CloudFront  distribution  associated
          with this custom domain name for an edge-optimized endpoint. You set
          up this association when adding a DNS record pointing the custom do-
          main  name  to  this  distribution  name. For more information about
          CloudFront distributions, see the Amazon CloudFront documentation.

       distributionHostedZoneId -> (string)
          The region-agnostic Amazon Route 53 Hosted Zone ID of the edge-opti-
          mized  endpoint.  The  valid value is Z2FDTNDATAQYW2 for all the re-
          gions. For more information, see Set up  a  Regional  Custom  Domain
          Name and AWS Regions and Endpoints for API Gateway.

       endpointConfiguration -> (structure)
          The  endpoint  configuration of this DomainName showing the endpoint
          types of the domain name.

              A list of endpoint types of an API (RestApi) or its  custom  do-
              main name (DomainName). For an edge-optimized API and its custom
              domain name, the endpoint type is "EDGE" . For  a  regional  API
              and  its custom domain name, the endpoint type is REGIONAL . For
              a private API, the endpoint type is PRIVATE .

              (string)
                 The endpoint type. The valid values are EDGE  for  edge-opti-
                 mized  API  setup, most suitable for mobile applications; RE-
                 GIONAL for regional API endpoint  setup,  most  suitable  for
                 calling from AWS Region; and PRIVATE for private APIs.

          vpcEndpointIds -> (list)
              A  list  of  VpcEndpointIds of an API (RestApi) against which to
              create Route53 ALIASes. It is only supported  for  PRIVATE  end-
              point type.

              (string)

       domainNameStatus -> (string)
          The  status of the DomainName migration. The valid values are AVAIL-
          ABLE and UPDATING . If the status is UPDATING , the domain cannot be
          modified  further until the existing operation is complete. If it is
          AVAILABLE , the domain can be updated.

       domainNameStatusMessage -> (string)
          An optional text message containing detailed information about  sta-
          tus of the DomainName migration.

       securityPolicy -> (string)
          The  Transport  Layer Security (TLS) version + cipher suite for this
          DomainName. The valid values are TLS_1_0 and TLS_1_2 .

       tags -> (map)
          The collection of tags. Each tag element is associated with a  given
          resource.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       mutualTlsAuthentication -> (structure)
          The  mutual  TLS  authentication  configuration  for a custom domain
          name. If specified, API Gateway performs two-way authentication  be-
          tween the client and the server. Clients must present a trusted cer-
          tificate to access your API.

          truststoreUri -> (string)
              An Amazon S3 URL that specifies the truststore  for  mutual  TLS
              authentication,  for  example  s3://bucket-name/key-name  .  The
              truststore can contain certificates from public or private  cer-
              tificate  authorities.  To  update  the truststore, upload a new
              version to S3, and then update your custom domain  name  to  use
              the new version. To update the truststore, you must have permis-
              sions to access the S3 object.

          truststoreVersion -> (string)
              The version of the S3 object that contains your  truststore.  To
              specify  a  version, you must have versioning enabled for the S3
              bucket.

          truststoreWarnings -> (list)
              A list of warnings that API  Gateway  returns  while  processing
              your  truststore.  Invalid certificates produce warnings. Mutual
              TLS is still enabled, but some clients might not be able to  ac-
              cess  your  API. To resolve warnings, upload a new truststore to
              S3, and then update you domain name to use the new version.

              (string)

       ownershipVerificationCertificateArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the public certificate issued by ACM to  validate  owner-
          ship  of  your  custom domain. Only required when configuring mutual
          TLS and using an ACM imported or private CA certificate ARN  as  the
          regionalCertificateArn.
