SYNOPSIS
            create-documentation-part
          --rest-api-id <value>
          --location <value>
          --properties <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          [Required] The string identifier of the associated  RestApi .

       --location (structure)
          [Required] The location of the targeted API entity of the to-be-cre-
          ated documentation part.

          type -> (string)
              [Required] The type of API entity  to  which  the  documentation
              content applies. Valid values are API , AUTHORIZER , MODEL , RE-
              SOURCE  ,  METHOD  ,  PATH_PARAMETER  ,  QUERY_PARAMETER  ,  RE-
              QUEST_HEADER  ,  REQUEST_BODY , RESPONSE , RESPONSE_HEADER , and
              RESPONSE_BODY . Content inheritance does not apply to any entity
              of the API , AUTHORIZER , METHOD , MODEL , REQUEST_BODY , or RE-
              SOURCE type.

          path -> (string)
              The URL path of the target. It is a valid field for the API  en-
              tity types of RESOURCE , METHOD , PATH_PARAMETER , QUERY_PARAME-
              TER , REQUEST_HEADER , REQUEST_BODY , RESPONSE , RESPONSE_HEADER
              ,  and  RESPONSE_BODY  . The default value is / for the root re-
              source. When an applicable child entity inherits the content  of
              another entity of the same type with more general specifications
              of the other location attributes, the child entity's path attri-
              bute must match that of the parent entity as a prefix.

          method -> (string)
              The  HTTP  verb of a method. It is a valid field for the API en-
              tity types of METHOD , PATH_PARAMETER ,  QUERY_PARAMETER  ,  RE-
              QUEST_HEADER  ,  REQUEST_BODY , RESPONSE , RESPONSE_HEADER , and
              RESPONSE_BODY . The default value is * for any method.  When  an
              applicable child entity inherits the content of an entity of the
              same type with more general specifications of the other location
              attributes,  the child entity's method attribute must match that
              of the parent entity exactly.

          statusCode -> (string)
              The HTTP status code of a response. It is a valid field for  the
              API  entity  types  of  RESPONSE  ,  RESPONSE_HEADER  ,  and RE-
              SPONSE_BODY . The default value is * for any status  code.  When
              an  applicable child entity inherits the content of an entity of
              the same type with more general specifications of the other  lo-
              cation  attributes, the child entity's statusCode attribute must
              match that of the parent entity exactly.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the targeted API entity. It is a valid and  required
              field  for the API entity types of AUTHORIZER , MODEL , PATH_PA-
              RAMETER , QUERY_PARAMETER , REQUEST_HEADER  ,  REQUEST_BODY  and
              RESPONSE_HEADER  .  It  is an invalid field for any other entity
              type.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          type=string,path=string,method=string,statusCode=string,name=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "type": "API"|"AUTHORIZER"|"MODEL"|"RESOURCE"|"METHOD"|"PATH_PARAMETER"|"QUERY_PARAMETER"|"REQUEST_HEADER"|"REQUEST_BODY"|"RESPONSE"|"RESPONSE_HEADER"|"RESPONSE_BODY",
            "path": "string",
            "method": "string",
            "statusCode": "string",
            "name": "string"
          }

       --properties (string)
          [Required] The new documentation content map of the targeted API en-
          tity.  Enclosed  key-value  pairs  are  API-specific,  but only Ope-
          nAPI-compliant key-value pairs can  be  exported  and,  hence,  pub-
          lished.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       id -> (string)
          The  DocumentationPart identifier, generated by API Gateway when the
          DocumentationPart is created.

       location -> (structure)
          The location of the API entity to which the  documentation  applies.
          Valid  fields  depend on the targeted API entity type. All the valid
          location fields are not required. If  not  explicitly  specified,  a
          valid  location  field is treated as a wildcard and associated docu-
          mentation content may be  inherited  by  matching  entities,  unless
          overridden.

          type -> (string)
              [Required]  The  type  of  API entity to which the documentation
              content applies. Valid values are API , AUTHORIZER , MODEL , RE-
              SOURCE  ,  METHOD  ,  PATH_PARAMETER  ,  QUERY_PARAMETER  ,  RE-
              QUEST_HEADER , REQUEST_BODY , RESPONSE , RESPONSE_HEADER  ,  and
              RESPONSE_BODY . Content inheritance does not apply to any entity
              of the API , AUTHORIZER , METHOD , MODEL , REQUEST_BODY , or RE-
              SOURCE type.

          path -> (string)
              The  URL path of the target. It is a valid field for the API en-
              tity types of RESOURCE , METHOD , PATH_PARAMETER , QUERY_PARAME-
              TER , REQUEST_HEADER , REQUEST_BODY , RESPONSE , RESPONSE_HEADER
              , and RESPONSE_BODY . The default value is / for  the  root  re-
              source.  When an applicable child entity inherits the content of
              another entity of the same type with more general specifications
              of the other location attributes, the child entity's path attri-
              bute must match that of the parent entity as a prefix.

          method -> (string)
              The HTTP verb of a method. It is a valid field for the  API  en-
              tity  types  of  METHOD , PATH_PARAMETER , QUERY_PARAMETER , RE-
              QUEST_HEADER , REQUEST_BODY , RESPONSE , RESPONSE_HEADER  ,  and
              RESPONSE_BODY  .  The default value is * for any method. When an
              applicable child entity inherits the content of an entity of the
              same type with more general specifications of the other location
              attributes, the child entity's method attribute must match  that
              of the parent entity exactly.

          statusCode -> (string)
              The  HTTP status code of a response. It is a valid field for the
              API entity  types  of  RESPONSE  ,  RESPONSE_HEADER  ,  and  RE-
              SPONSE_BODY  .  The default value is * for any status code. When
              an applicable child entity inherits the content of an entity  of
              the  same type with more general specifications of the other lo-
              cation attributes, the child entity's statusCode attribute  must
              match that of the parent entity exactly.

          name -> (string)
              The  name of the targeted API entity. It is a valid and required
              field for the API entity types of AUTHORIZER , MODEL ,  PATH_PA-
              RAMETER  ,  QUERY_PARAMETER  , REQUEST_HEADER , REQUEST_BODY and
              RESPONSE_HEADER . It is an invalid field for  any  other  entity
              type.

       properties -> (string)
          A  content  map  of API-specific key-value pairs describing the tar-
          geted API entity. The map must be encoded as a JSON string, e.g., "{
          \"description\":  \"The  API  does ...\" }" . Only OpenAPI-compliant
          documentation-related fields from  the  propertiesmap  are  exported
          and,  hence,  published as part of the API entity definitions, while
          the original documentation parts are exported in a OpenAPI extension
          of x-amazon-apigateway-documentation .
