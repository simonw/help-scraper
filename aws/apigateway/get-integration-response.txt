NAME
       get-integration-response -

DESCRIPTION
       Represents a get integration response.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-integration-response
          --rest-api-id <value>
          --resource-id <value>
          --http-method <value>
          --status-code <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          [Required] The string identifier of the associated  RestApi .

       --resource-id (string)
          [Required]  Specifies  a get integration response request's resource
          identifier.

       --http-method (string)
          [Required] Specifies  a  get  integration  response  request's  HTTP
          method.

       --status-code (string)
          [Required]  Specifies  a  get  integration response request's status
          code.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the integration response configuration for a HTTP method defined
       under a REST API's resource

       Command:

          aws apigateway get-integration-response --rest-api-id 1234123412 --resource-id y9h6rt --http-method GET --status-code 200

       Output:

          {
              "statusCode": "200",
              "responseTemplates": {
                  "application/json": null
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       statusCode -> (string)
          Specifies  the  status  code that is used to map the integration re-
          sponse to an existing  MethodResponse .

       selectionPattern -> (string)
          Specifies the regular expression (regex) pattern used to  choose  an
          integration  response  based  on the response from the back end. For
          example, if the success response returns nothing and the  error  re-
          sponse  returns some string, you could use the .+ regex to match er-
          ror response. However, make sure that the error  response  does  not
          contain  any  newline (\n ) character in such cases. If the back end
          is an AWS Lambda function, the AWS Lambda function error  header  is
          matched.  For all other HTTP and AWS back ends, the HTTP status code
          is matched.

       responseParameters -> (map)
          A key-value map specifying response parameters that  are  passed  to
          the  method response from the back end. The key is a method response
          header parameter name and the mapped value  is  an  integration  re-
          sponse header value, a static value enclosed within a pair of single
          quotes, or a JSON expression from the integration response body. The
          mapping  key must match the pattern of method.response.header.{name}
          , where  name  is  a  valid  and  unique  header  name.  The  mapped
          non-static   value   must   match  the  pattern  of  integration.re-
          sponse.header.{name} or  integration.response.body.{JSON-expression}
          , where name is a valid and unique response header name and JSON-ex-
          pression is a valid JSON expression without the $ prefix.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       responseTemplates -> (map)
          Specifies the templates used to transform the  integration  response
          body.  Response templates are represented as a key/value map, with a
          content-type as the key and a template as the value.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       contentHandling -> (string)
          Specifies how to handle response payload content  type  conversions.
          Supported  values  are  CONVERT_TO_BINARY and CONVERT_TO_TEXT , with
          the following behaviors:

          o CONVERT_TO_BINARY : Converts a response payload from a  Base64-en-
            coded string to the corresponding binary blob.

          o CONVERT_TO_TEXT  :  Converts a response payload from a binary blob
            to a Base64-encoded string.

          If this property is not defined, the response payload will be passed
          through from the integration response to the method response without
          modification.
