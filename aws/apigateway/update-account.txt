SYNOPSIS
            update-account
          [--patch-operations <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --patch-operations (list)
          A  list of update operations to be applied to the specified resource
          and in the order specified in this list.

          (structure)
              A single patch operation to apply  to  the  specified  resource.
              Please refer to http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902#section-4 for
              an explanation of how each operation is used.

              op -> (string)
                 An update operation to be performed with this PATCH  request.
                 The  valid  value can be add , remove , replace or copy . Not
                 all valid operations are supported for a given resource. Sup-
                 port  of  the operations depends on specific operational con-
                 texts. Attempts to apply an unsupported operation  on  a  re-
                 source will return an error message.

              path -> (string)
                 The  op  operation's  target, as identified by a JSON Pointer
                 value that references a  location  within  the  targeted  re-
                 source. For example, if the target resource has an updateable
                 property of {"name":"value"} , the path for this property  is
                 /name  .  If  the name property value is a JSON object (e.g.,
                 {"name": {"child/name": "child-value"}} ), the path  for  the
                 child/name  property  will  be  /name/child~1name . Any slash
                 ("/") character appearing in path names must be escaped  with
                 "~1",  as  shown  in the example above. Each op operation can
                 have only one path associated with it.

              value -> (string)
                 The new target value of the update operation. It is  applica-
                 ble  for  the add or replace operation. When using AWS CLI to
                 update a property of a JSON value, enclose  the  JSON  object
                 with  a  pair of single quotes in a Linux shell, e.g., '{"a":
                 ...}'. In a Windows shell, see Using JSON for Parameters .

              from -> (string)
                 The  copy  update  operation's  source  as  identified  by  a
                 JSON-Pointer  value  referencing the location within the tar-
                 geted resource to copy the value from. For example,  to  pro-
                 mote  a  canary deployment, you copy the canary deployment ID
                 to the affiliated deployment ID by calling a PATCH request on
                 a   Stage  resource  with  "op":"copy"  , "from":"/canarySet-
                 tings/deploymentId" and "path":"/deploymentId" .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          op=string,path=string,value=string,from=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "op": "add"|"remove"|"replace"|"move"|"copy"|"test",
              "path": "string",
              "value": "string",
              "from": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To change the IAM Role ARN for logging to CloudWatch Logs

       Command:

          aws apigateway update-account --patch-operations op='replace',path='/cloudwatchRoleArn',value='arn:aws:iam::123412341234:role/APIGatewayToCloudWatchLogs'

       Output:

          {
              "cloudwatchRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123412341234:role/APIGatewayToCloudWatchLogs",
              "throttleSettings": {
                  "rateLimit": 1000.0,
                  "burstLimit": 2000
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       cloudwatchRoleArn -> (string)
          The ARN of an Amazon CloudWatch role for the current  Account .

       throttleSettings -> (structure)
          Specifies the API request limits configured for the current  Account
          .

          burstLimit -> (integer)
              The API target request burst rate limit. This  allows  more  re-
              quests through for a period of time than the target rate limit.

          rateLimit -> (double)
              The API target request rate limit.

       features -> (list)
          A  list  of features supported for the account. When usage plans are
          enabled, the features list will include an entry of "UsagePlans" .

          (string)

       apiKeyVersion -> (string)
          The version of the API keys used for the account.
