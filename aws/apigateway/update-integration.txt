SYNOPSIS
            update-integration
          --rest-api-id <value>
          --resource-id <value>
          --http-method <value>
          [--patch-operations <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          The string identifier of the associated RestApi.

       --resource-id (string)
          Represents an update integration request's resource identifier.

       --http-method (string)
          Represents an update integration request's HTTP method.

       --patch-operations (list)
          For more information about supported patch operations, see Patch Op-
          erations .

          (structure)
              For more information about supported patch operations, see Patch
              Operations .

              op -> (string)
                 An  update operation to be performed with this PATCH request.
                 The valid value can be add, remove, replace or copy. Not  all
                 valid  operations are supported for a given resource. Support
                 of the operations depends on specific  operational  contexts.
                 Attempts to apply an unsupported operation on a resource will
                 return an error message..

              path -> (string)
                 The op operation's target, as identified by  a  JSON  Pointer
                 value  that  references  a  location  within the targeted re-
                 source. For example, if the target resource has an updateable
                 property  of  {"name":"value"}, the path for this property is
                 /name. If the name property value is  a  JSON  object  (e.g.,
                 {"name":  {"child/name":  "child-value"}}),  the path for the
                 child/name property  will  be  /name/child~1name.  Any  slash
                 ("/")  character appearing in path names must be escaped with
                 "~1", as shown in the example above. Each  op  operation  can
                 have only one path associated with it.

              value -> (string)
                 The  new target value of the update operation. It is applica-
                 ble for the add or replace operation. When using AWS  CLI  to
                 update  a  property  of a JSON value, enclose the JSON object
                 with a pair of single quotes in a Linux shell,  e.g.,  '{"a":
                 ...}'.

              from -> (string)
                 The  copy  update  operation's  source  as  identified  by  a
                 JSON-Pointer value referencing the location within  the  tar-
                 geted  resource  to copy the value from. For example, to pro-
                 mote a canary deployment, you copy the canary  deployment  ID
                 to the affiliated deployment ID by calling a PATCH request on
                 a  Stage  resource  with   "op":"copy",   "from":"/canarySet-
                 tings/deploymentId" and "path":"/deploymentId".

       Shorthand Syntax:

          op=string,path=string,value=string,from=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "op": "add"|"remove"|"replace"|"move"|"copy"|"test",
              "path": "string",
              "value": "string",
              "from": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       type -> (string)
          Specifies  an API method integration type. The valid value is one of
          the following:

          For the HTTP and HTTP proxy integrations, each integration can spec-
          ify  a  protocol  (http/https  ), port and path. Standard 80 and 443
          ports are supported as well as custom ports above 1024. An  HTTP  or
          HTTP proxy integration with a connectionType of VPC_LINK is referred
          to as a private integration and uses a VpcLink to connect API  Gate-
          way to a network load balancer of a VPC.

       httpMethod -> (string)
          Specifies the integration's HTTP method type.

       uri -> (string)
          Specifies  Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of the integration end-
          point.

          For HTTP or HTTP_PROXY integrations, the URI must be a fully formed,
          encoded HTTP(S) URL according to the RFC-3986 specification, for ei-
          ther standard integration, where connectionType is not VPC_LINK , or
          private  integration,  where connectionType is VPC_LINK . For a pri-
          vate HTTP integration, the URI is not used for routing. For  AWS  or
          AWS_PROXY  integrations,  the  URI  is  of the form arn:aws:apigate-
          way:{region}:{subdomain.service|service}:path|action/{service_api} .
          Here,  {Region}  is  the API Gateway region (e.g., us-east-1); {ser-
          vice} is the name of the  integrated  Amazon  Web  Services  service
          (e.g.,  s3);  and {subdomain} is a designated subdomain supported by
          certain Amazon Web Services service for fast host-name  lookup.  ac-
          tion  can  be  used  for an Amazon Web Services service action-based
          API, using an Action={name}&{p1}={v1}&p2={v2}... query  string.  The
          ensuing  {service_api}  refers to a supported action {name} plus any
          required input parameters. Alternatively, path can be  used  for  an
          AWS  service  path-based  API. The ensuing service_api refers to the
          path to an Amazon Web Services service resource, including  the  re-
          gion  of  the integrated Amazon Web Services service, if applicable.
          For example, for integration with the S3 API of GetObject,  the  uri
          can    be    either    arn:aws:apigateway:us-west-2:s3:action/GetOb-
          ject&Bucket={bucket}&Key={key}          or          arn:aws:apigate-
          way:us-west-2:s3:path/{bucket}/{key}

       connectionType -> (string)
          The  type of the network connection to the integration endpoint. The
          valid value is INTERNET for connections through the public  routable
          internet or VPC_LINK for private connections between API Gateway and
          a network load balancer in a VPC. The default value is INTERNET .

       connectionId -> (string)
          The ID of the VpcLink used  for  the  integration  when  connection-
          Type=VPC_LINK and undefined, otherwise.

       credentials -> (string)
          Specifies  the credentials required for the integration, if any. For
          AWS integrations, three options are available.  To  specify  an  IAM
          Role  for API Gateway to assume, use the role's Amazon Resource Name
          (ARN). To require that the caller's identity be passed through  from
          the request, specify the string arn:aws:iam::\*:user/\* . To use re-
          source-based permissions on supported AWS services, specify null.

       requestParameters -> (map)
          A key-value map specifying request parameters that are  passed  from
          the  method  request  to the back end. The key is an integration re-
          quest parameter name and the associated value is  a  method  request
          parameter  value or static value that must be enclosed within single
          quotes and pre-encoded as required by the back end. The  method  re-
          quest  parameter value must match the pattern of method.request.{lo-
          cation}.{name} , where location is querystring , path  ,  or  header
          and name must be a valid and unique method request parameter name.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       requestTemplates -> (map)
          Represents  a  map of Velocity templates that are applied on the re-
          quest payload based on the value of the Content-Type header sent  by
          the  client.  The content type value is the key in this map, and the
          template (as a String) is the value.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       passthroughBehavior -> (string)
          Specifies how the method request body of an  unmapped  content  type
          will be passed through the integration request to the back end with-
          out transformation. A content type is unmapped if  no  mapping  tem-
          plate  is  defined  in  the integration or the content type does not
          match any of the mapped content types, as specified  in  requestTem-
          plates  .  The  valid value is one of the following: WHEN_NO_MATCH :
          passes the method request body through the  integration  request  to
          the  back end without transformation when the method request content
          type does not match any content type  associated  with  the  mapping
          templates  defined  in  the integration request. WHEN_NO_TEMPLATES :
          passes the method request body through the  integration  request  to
          the  back end without transformation when no mapping template is de-
          fined in the integration request. If a template is defined when this
          option  is  selected, the method request of an unmapped content-type
          will be rejected with an HTTP 415 Unsupported Media  Type  response.
          NEVER  : rejects the method request with an HTTP 415 Unsupported Me-
          dia Type response when either the method request content  type  does
          not match any content type associated with the mapping templates de-
          fined in the integration request or no mapping template  is  defined
          in the integration request.

       contentHandling -> (string)
          Specifies  how  to  handle request payload content type conversions.
          Supported values are CONVERT_TO_BINARY and  CONVERT_TO_TEXT  ,  with
          the following behaviors:

          If  this property is not defined, the request payload will be passed
          through from the method request to integration request without modi-
          fication,  provided  that  the  passthroughBehavior is configured to
          support payload pass-through.

       timeoutInMillis -> (integer)
          Custom timeout between 50 and 29,000 milliseconds. The default value
          is 29,000 milliseconds or 29 seconds.

       cacheNamespace -> (string)
          Specifies  a  group  of  related  cached parameters. By default, API
          Gateway uses the resource ID as the cacheNamespace . You can specify
          the  same  cacheNamespace across resources to return the same cached
          data for requests to different resources.

       cacheKeyParameters -> (list)
          A list of request parameters whose values API Gateway caches. To  be
          valid  values for cacheKeyParameters , these parameters must also be
          specified for Method requestParameters .

          (string)

       integrationResponses -> (map)
          Specifies the integration's responses.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Represents an integration response. The status code must map  to
              an  existing MethodResponse, and parameters and templates can be
              used to transform the back-end response.

              statusCode -> (string)
                 Specifies the status code that is used to map the integration
                 response to an existing MethodResponse.

              selectionPattern -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  regular  expression  (regex)  pattern used to
                 choose an integration response based on the response from the
                 back  end. For example, if the success response returns noth-
                 ing and the error response returns some string, you could use
                 the .+ regex to match error response. However, make sure that
                 the error response does not contain any newline (\n ) charac-
                 ter in such cases. If the back end is an AWS Lambda function,
                 the AWS Lambda function error  header  is  matched.  For  all
                 other  HTTP  and  AWS  back  ends,  the  HTTP  status code is
                 matched.

              responseParameters -> (map)
                 A key-value  map  specifying  response  parameters  that  are
                 passed to the method response from the back end. The key is a
                 method response header parameter name and the mapped value is
                 an integration response header value, a static value enclosed
                 within a pair of single quotes, or a JSON expression from the
                 integration  response  body.  The  mapping key must match the
                 pattern of method.response.header.{name} , where  name  is  a
                 valid  and  unique  header  name. The mapped non-static value
                 must match the pattern of  integration.response.header.{name}
                 or  integration.response.body.{JSON-expression}  , where name
                 is a valid and unique response header name  and  JSON-expres-
                 sion is a valid JSON expression without the $ prefix.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              responseTemplates -> (map)
                 Specifies the templates used to transform the integration re-
                 sponse  body.  Response  templates  are  represented   as   a
                 key/value  map, with a content-type as the key and a template
                 as the value.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              contentHandling -> (string)
                 Specifies how to handle response payload content type conver-
                 sions.   Supported  values  are  CONVERT_TO_BINARY  and  CON-
                 VERT_TO_TEXT , with the following behaviors:

                 If this property is not defined, the response payload will be
                 passed  through  from  the integration response to the method
                 response without modification.

       tlsConfig -> (structure)
          Specifies the TLS configuration for an integration.

          insecureSkipVerification -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether or not API Gateway skips verification that the
              certificate for an integration endpoint is issued by a supported
              certificate authority. This isnt recommended, but it enables you
              to  use  certificates that are signed by private certificate au-
              thorities, or certificates that are self-signed. If enabled, API
              Gateway  still  performs basic certificate validation, which in-
              cludes checking the certificate's expiration date, hostname, and
              presence  of  a  root  certificate authority. Supported only for
              HTTP and HTTP_PROXY integrations.

              WARNING:
                 Enabling insecureSkipVerification  isn't  recommended,  espe-
                 cially  for  integrations with public HTTPS endpoints. If you
                 enable insecureSkipVerification , you increase  the  risk  of
                 man-in-the-middle attacks.
