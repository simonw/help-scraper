GET-API-KEYS()                                                  GET-API-KEYS()



NAME
       get-api-keys -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about the current  ApiKeys resource.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-api-keys is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: items

SYNOPSIS
            get-api-keys
          [--name-query <value>]
          [--customer-id <value>]
          [--include-values | --no-include-values]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name-query (string)
          The name of queried API keys.

       --customer-id (string)
          The identifier of a customer in AWS Marketplace or an external  sys-
          tem, such as a developer portal.

       --include-values | --no-include-values (boolean)
          A boolean flag to specify whether (true ) or not (false ) the result
          contains key values.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       Command:

          aws apigateway get-api-keys

       Output:

OUTPUT
       warnings -> (list)
          A list of warning messages logged during the import of API keys when
          the failOnWarnings option is set to true.

          (string)

       position -> (string)

       items -> (list)
          The current page of elements from this collection.

          (structure)
              A resource that can be  distributed  to  callers  for  executing

              to any  Stage on any  RestApi , which indicates that the callers
              with the API key can make requests to that stage.
