OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          [Required] The string identifier of the associated  RestApi .

       --resource-id (string)
          [Required] Specifies a put integration request's resource ID.

       --http-method (string)
          [Required] Specifies a put integration request's HTTP method.

       --type (string)
          [Required] Specifies a put integration input's type.

          Possible values:

          o HTTP

          o AWS

          o MOCK

          o HTTP_PROXY

          o AWS_PROXY

       --integration-http-method (string)
          Specifies  a  put integration HTTP method. When the integration type
          is HTTP or AWS, this field is required.

       --uri (string)
          Specifies Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of the integration  end-
          point.

          o For  HTTP  or  HTTP_PROXY  integrations,  the  URI must be a fully
            formed, encoded HTTP(S) URL according to the  RFC-3986  specifica-
            tion  ,  for  either standard integration, where connectionType is
            not VPC_LINK , or private  integration,  where  connectionType  is
            VPC_LINK . For a private HTTP integration, the URI is not used for
            routing.

          o For AWS  or  AWS_PROXY  integrations,  the  URI  is  of  the  form
            arn:aws:apigateway:{region}:{subdomain.service|service}:path|ac-
            tion/{service_api} . Here, {Region}  is  the  API  Gateway  region
            (e.g.,  us-east-1  );  {service} is the name of the integrated AWS
            service (e.g., s3 ); and {subdomain}  is  a  designated  subdomain
            supported by certain AWS service for fast host-name lookup. action
            can be used for an AWS service  action-based  API,  using  an  Ac-
            tion={name}&{p1}={v1}&p2={v2}...  query  string. The ensuing {ser-
            vice_api} refers to a supported action {name}  plus  any  required
            input  parameters. Alternatively, path can be used for an AWS ser-
            vice path-based API. The ensuing service_api refers to the path to
            an  AWS  service  resource, including the region of the integrated
            AWS service, if applicable. For example, for integration with  the
            S3  API  of  `GetObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/lat-
            est/API/RESTObjectGET.html>`__   ,   the   uri   can   be   either
            arn:aws:apigateway:us-west-2:s3:action/GetOb-
            ject&Bucket={bucket}&Key={key}         or         arn:aws:apigate-
            way:us-west-2:s3:path/{bucket}/{key}

       --connection-type (string)
          The  type of the network connection to the integration endpoint. The
          valid value is INTERNET for connections through the public  routable
          internet or VPC_LINK for private connections between API Gateway and
          a network load balancer in a VPC. The default value is INTERNET .

          Possible values:

          o INTERNET

          o VPC_LINK

       --connection-id (string)
          The                             (`id                              <-
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/re-
          source/vpc-link/#id>`__ ) of the  VpcLink used for  the  integration
          when connectionType=VPC_LINK and undefined, otherwise.

       --credentials (string)
          Specifies whether credentials are required for a put integration.

       --request-parameters (map)
          A  key-value  map specifying request parameters that are passed from
          the method request to the back end. The key is  an  integration  re-
          quest  parameter  name  and the associated value is a method request
          parameter value or static value that must be enclosed within  single
          quotes  and  pre-encoded as required by the back end. The method re-
          quest parameter value must match the pattern of  method.request.{lo-
          cation}.{name}  ,  where  location is querystring , path , or header
          and name must be a valid and unique method request parameter name.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --request-templates (map)
          Represents a map of Velocity templates that are applied on  the  re-
          quest  payload based on the value of the Content-Type header sent by
          the client. The content type value is the key in this map,  and  the
          template (as a String) is the value.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --passthrough-behavior (string)
          Specifies  the  pass-through behavior for incoming requests based on
          the Content-Type header in the request, and  the  available  mapping
          templates specified as the requestTemplates property on the Integra-
          tion  resource.  There  are  three  valid  values:  WHEN_NO_MATCH  ,
          WHEN_NO_TEMPLATES , and NEVER .

          o WHEN_NO_MATCH  passes  the request body for unmapped content types
            through to the integration back end without transformation.

          o NEVER rejects unmapped content types with an HTTP 415 'Unsupported
            Media Type' response.

          o WHEN_NO_TEMPLATES  allows pass-through when the integration has NO
            content types mapped to templates. However if there  is  at  least
            one  content type defined, unmapped content types will be rejected
            with the same 415 response.

       --cache-namespace (string)
          Specifies a group of related  cached  parameters.  By  default,  API
          Gateway uses the resource ID as the cacheNamespace . You can specify
          the same cacheNamespace across resources to return the  same  cached
          data for requests to different resources.

       --cache-key-parameters (list)
          A  list of request parameters whose values API Gateway caches. To be
          valid values for cacheKeyParameters , these parameters must also  be
          specified for  Method  requestParameters .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --content-handling (string)
          Specifies  how  to  handle request payload content type conversions.
          Supported values are CONVERT_TO_BINARY and  CONVERT_TO_TEXT  ,  with
          the following behaviors:

          o CONVERT_TO_BINARY  :  Converts a request payload from a Base64-en-
            coded string to the corresponding binary blob.

          o CONVERT_TO_TEXT : Converts a request payload from a binary blob to
            a Base64-encoded string.

          If  this property is not defined, the request payload will be passed
          through from the method request to integration request without modi-
          fication,  provided  that  the  passthroughBehavior is configured to
          support payload pass-through.

          Possible values:

          o CONVERT_TO_BINARY

          o CONVERT_TO_TEXT

       --timeout-in-millis (integer)
          Custom timeout between 50 and 29,000 milliseconds. The default value
          is 29,000 milliseconds or 29 seconds.

       --tls-config (structure) insecureSkipVerification -> (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  or  not  API Gateway skips verification that the
          certificate for an integration endpoint is  issued  by  a  supported
          certificate authority . This isnt recommended, but it enables you to
          use certificates that are signed by private certificate authorities,
          or  certificates that are self-signed. If enabled, API Gateway still
          performs basic certificate validation, which includes  checking  the
          certificate's expiration date, hostname, and presence of a root cer-
          tificate authority. Supported only for HTTP and HTTP_PROXY  integra-
          tions.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          insecureSkipVerification=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "insecureSkipVerification": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       type -> (string)
          Specifies an API method integration type. The valid value is one  of
          the following:

          o AWS  :  for integrating the API method request with an AWS service
            action, including the Lambda function-invoking  action.  With  the
            Lambda function-invoking action, this is referred to as the Lambda
            custom integration. With any other AWS  service  action,  this  is
            known as AWS integration.

          o AWS_PROXY : for integrating the API method request with the Lambda
            function-invoking action with the client  request  passed  through
            as-is.  This  integration  is also referred to as the Lambda proxy
            integration.

          o HTTP : for integrating the API method request with  an  HTTP  end-
            point,  including a private HTTP endpoint within a VPC. This inte-
            gration is also referred to as the HTTP custom integration.

          o HTTP_PROXY : for integrating the API method request with  an  HTTP
            endpoint, including a private HTTP endpoint within a VPC, with the
            client request passed through as-is. This is also referred  to  as
            the HTTP proxy integration.

          o MOCK  : for integrating the API method request with API Gateway as
            a "loop-back" endpoint without invoking any backend.

          For the HTTP and HTTP proxy integrations, each integration can spec-
          ify  a  protocol  (http/https  ), port and path. Standard 80 and 443
          ports are supported as well as custom ports above 1024. An  HTTP  or
          HTTP proxy integration with a connectionType of VPC_LINK is referred
          to as a private integration and uses a  VpcLink to connect API Gate-
          way to a network load balancer of a VPC.

       httpMethod -> (string)
          Specifies the integration's HTTP method type.

       uri -> (string)
          Specifies  Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of the integration end-
          point.

          o For HTTP or HTTP_PROXY integrations,  the  URI  must  be  a  fully
            formed,  encoded  HTTP(S) URL according to the RFC-3986 specifica-
            tion , for either standard integration,  where  connectionType  is
            not  VPC_LINK  ,  or  private integration, where connectionType is
            VPC_LINK . For a private HTTP integration, the URI is not used for
            routing.

          o For  AWS  or  AWS_PROXY  integrations,  the  URI  is  of  the form
            arn:aws:apigateway:{region}:{subdomain.service|service}:path|ac-
            tion/{service_api}  .  Here,  {Region}  is  the API Gateway region
            (e.g., us-east-1 ); {service} is the name of  the  integrated  AWS
            service  (e.g.,  s3  );  and {subdomain} is a designated subdomain
            supported by certain AWS service for fast host-name lookup. action
            can  be  used  for  an  AWS service action-based API, using an Ac-
            tion={name}&{p1}={v1}&p2={v2}... query string. The  ensuing  {ser-
            vice_api}  refers  to  a supported action {name} plus any required
            input parameters. Alternatively, path can be used for an AWS  ser-
            vice path-based API. The ensuing service_api refers to the path to
            an AWS service resource, including the region  of  the  integrated
            AWS  service, if applicable. For example, for integration with the
            S3 API  of  `GetObject  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/lat-
            est/API/RESTObjectGET.html>`__   ,   the   uri   can   be   either
            arn:aws:apigateway:us-west-2:s3:action/GetOb-
            ject&Bucket={bucket}&Key={key}         or         arn:aws:apigate-
            way:us-west-2:s3:path/{bucket}/{key}

       connectionType -> (string)
          The type of the network connection to the integration endpoint.  The
          valid  value is INTERNET for connections through the public routable
          internet or VPC_LINK for private connections between API Gateway and
          a network load balancer in a VPC. The default value is INTERNET .

       connectionId -> (string)
          The                              (`id                             <-
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/re-
          source/vpc-link/#id>`__  )  of the  VpcLink used for the integration
          when connectionType=VPC_LINK and undefined, otherwise.

       credentials -> (string)
          Specifies the credentials required for the integration, if any.  For
          AWS  integrations,  three  options  are available. To specify an IAM
          Role for API Gateway to assume, use the role's Amazon Resource  Name
          (ARN).  To require that the caller's identity be passed through from
          the request, specify the string arn:aws:iam::\*:user/\* . To use re-
          source-based permissions on supported AWS services, specify null.

       requestParameters -> (map)
          A  key-value  map specifying request parameters that are passed from
          the method request to the back end. The key is  an  integration  re-
          quest  parameter  name  and the associated value is a method request
          parameter value or static value that must be enclosed within  single
          quotes  and  pre-encoded as required by the back end. The method re-
          quest parameter value must match the pattern of  method.request.{lo-
          cation}.{name}  ,  where  location is querystring , path , or header
          and name must be a valid and unique method request parameter name.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       requestTemplates -> (map)
          Represents a map of Velocity templates that are applied on  the  re-
          quest  payload based on the value of the Content-Type header sent by
          the client. The content type value is the key in this map,  and  the
          template (as a String) is the value.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       passthroughBehavior -> (string)
          Specifies  how  the  method request body of an unmapped content type
          will be passed through the integration request to the back end with-
          out  transformation.  A  content type is unmapped if no mapping tem-
          plate is defined in the integration or the  content  type  does  not
          match  any  of the mapped content types, as specified in requestTem-
          plates . The valid value is one of the following:

          o WHEN_NO_MATCH : passes the method request body through  the  inte-
            gration  request  to  the back end without transformation when the
            method request content type does not match any content type  asso-
            ciated  with  the mapping templates defined in the integration re-
            quest.

          o WHEN_NO_TEMPLATES : passes the method request body through the in-
            tegration  request  to the back end without transformation when no
            mapping template is defined in the integration request. If a  tem-
            plate  is defined when this option is selected, the method request
            of an unmapped content-type will be rejected with an HTTP 415  Un-
            supported Media Type response.

          o NEVER  :  rejects  the method request with an HTTP 415 Unsupported
            Media Type response when either the method  request  content  type
            does  not  match any content type associated with the mapping tem-
            plates defined in the integration request or no  mapping  template
            is defined in the integration request.

       contentHandling -> (string)
          Specifies  how  to  handle request payload content type conversions.
          Supported values are CONVERT_TO_BINARY and  CONVERT_TO_TEXT  ,  with
          the following behaviors:

          o CONVERT_TO_BINARY  :  Converts a request payload from a Base64-en-
            coded string to the corresponding binary blob.

          o CONVERT_TO_TEXT : Converts a request payload from a binary blob to
            a Base64-encoded string.

          If  this property is not defined, the request payload will be passed
          through from the method request to integration request without modi-
          fication,  provided  that  the  passthroughBehavior is configured to
          support payload pass-through.

       timeoutInMillis -> (integer)
          Custom timeout between 50 and 29,000 milliseconds. The default value
          is 29,000 milliseconds or 29 seconds.

       cacheNamespace -> (string)
          Specifies  a  group  of  related  cached parameters. By default, API
          Gateway uses the resource ID as the cacheNamespace . You can specify
          the  same  cacheNamespace across resources to return the same cached
          data for requests to different resources.

       cacheKeyParameters -> (list)
          A list of request parameters whose values API Gateway caches. To  be
          valid  values for cacheKeyParameters , these parameters must also be
          specified for  Method  requestParameters .

          (string)

       integrationResponses -> (map)
          Specifies the integration's responses.
              Example: Get integration responses of a method Request

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Represents  an integration response. The status code must map to
              an existing  MethodResponse , and parameters and  templates  can
              be used to transform the back-end response.
                 Creating an API

              statusCode -> (string)
                 Specifies the status code that is used to map the integration
                 response to an existing  MethodResponse .

              selectionPattern -> (string)
                 Specifies the regular  expression  (regex)  pattern  used  to
                 choose an integration response based on the response from the
                 back end. For example, if the success response returns  noth-
                 ing and the error response returns some string, you could use
                 the .+ regex to match error response. However, make sure that
                 the error response does not contain any newline (\n ) charac-
                 ter in such cases. If the back end is an AWS Lambda function,
                 the  AWS  Lambda  function  error  header is matched. For all
                 other HTTP and  AWS  back  ends,  the  HTTP  status  code  is
                 matched.

              responseParameters -> (map)
                 A  key-value  map  specifying  response  parameters  that are
                 passed to the method response from the back end. The key is a
                 method response header parameter name and the mapped value is
                 an integration response header value, a static value enclosed
                 within a pair of single quotes, or a JSON expression from the
                 integration response body. The mapping  key  must  match  the
                 pattern  of  method.response.header.{name}  , where name is a
                 valid and unique header name.  The  mapped  non-static  value
                 must  match the pattern of integration.response.header.{name}
                 or integration.response.body.{JSON-expression} ,  where  name
                 is  a  valid and unique response header name and JSON-expres-
                 sion is a valid JSON expression without the $ prefix.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              responseTemplates -> (map)
                 Specifies the templates used to transform the integration re-
                 sponse   body.   Response  templates  are  represented  as  a
                 key/value map, with a content-type as the key and a  template
                 as the value.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              contentHandling -> (string)
                 Specifies how to handle response payload content type conver-
                 sions.  Supported  values  are  CONVERT_TO_BINARY  and   CON-
                 VERT_TO_TEXT , with the following behaviors:

                 o CONVERT_TO_BINARY  :  Converts  a  response  payload from a
                   Base64-encoded string to the corresponding binary blob.

                 o CONVERT_TO_TEXT : Converts a response payload from a binary
                   blob to a Base64-encoded string.

                 If this property is not defined, the response payload will be
                 passed through from the integration response  to  the  method
                 response without modification.

       tlsConfig -> (structure)
          Specifies the TLS configuration for an integration.

          insecureSkipVerification -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether or not API Gateway skips verification that the
              certificate for an integration endpoint is issued by a supported
              certificate  authority  .  This isnt recommended, but it enables
              you to use certificates that are signed by  private  certificate
              authorities,  or  certificates that are self-signed. If enabled,
              API Gateway still performs basic certificate  validation,  which
              includes  checking  the certificate's expiration date, hostname,
              and presence of a root certificate authority. Supported only for
              HTTP and HTTP_PROXY integrations.
