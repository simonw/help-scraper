GET-DEPLOYMENTS()                                            GET-DEPLOYMENTS()



NAME
       get-deployments -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about a Deployments collection.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-deployments is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: items

SYNOPSIS
            get-deployments
          --rest-api-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          The string identifier of the associated RestApi.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a list of deployments for a REST API

       Command:

          aws apigateway get-deployments --rest-api-id 1234123412

       Output:

          {
              "items": [
                  {
                      "createdDate": 1453797217,
                      "id": "0a2b4c",
                      "description": "Deployed my API for the first time"
                  }
              ]
          }

          (structure)
              An immutable representation of a RestApi resource  that  can  be

              id -> (string)
                 The identifier for the deployment resource.

              description -> (string)
                 The description for the deployment resource.

              createdDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the deployment resource was created.

              apiSummary -> (map)
                 A summary of the RestApi at the date and time  that  the  de-
                 ployment resource was created.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (map)
                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Represents  a  summary  of  a Method resource, given a
                        particular date and time.

                        authorizationType -> (string)

                            NONE  for  open  access, AWS_IAM for using AWS IAM
                            permissions, CUSTOM for using a custom authorizer,
                            or  COGNITO_USER_POOLS  for  using  a Cognito user
                            pool.
