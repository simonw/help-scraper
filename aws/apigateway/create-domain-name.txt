       --domain-name (string)
          [Required] The name of the  DomainName resource.

       --certificate-name (string)
          The  user-friendly  name  of  the  certificate  that will be used by
          edge-optimized endpoint for this domain name.

       --certificate-body (string)
          [Deprecated] The body of the server certificate that will be used by
          edge-optimized  endpoint  for this domain name provided by your cer-
          tificate authority.

       --certificate-private-key (string)
          [Deprecated] Your edge-optimized  endpoint's  domain  name  certifi-
          cate's private key.

       --certificate-chain (string)
          [Deprecated]  The  intermediate certificates and optionally the root
          certificate, one after the other without any blank lines, used by an
          edge-optimized  endpoint  for  this  domain name. If you include the
          root certificate, your certificate chain must start with  intermedi-
          ate certificates and end with the root certificate. Use the interme-
          diate certificates that were provided by your certificate authority.
          Do not include any intermediaries that are not in the chain of trust
          path.

       --certificate-arn (string)
          The reference to an AWS-managed certificate that  will  be  used  by
          edge-optimized  endpoint  for this domain name. AWS Certificate Man-
          ager is the only supported source.

       --regional-certificate-name (string)
          The user-friendly name of the certificate that will be used  by  re-
          gional endpoint for this domain name.

       --regional-certificate-arn (string)
          The reference to an AWS-managed certificate that will be used by re-
          gional endpoint for this domain name. AWS Certificate Manager is the
          only supported source.

       --endpoint-configuration (structure)
          The  endpoint configuration of this  DomainName showing the endpoint
          types of the domain name.

          types -> (list)
              A list of endpoint types of an API ( RestApi ) or its custom do-
              main name ( DomainName ). For an edge-optimized API and its cus-
              tom domain name, the endpoint type is "EDGE" .  For  a  regional
              API  and its custom domain name, the endpoint type is REGIONAL .
              For a private API, the endpoint type is PRIVATE .

              (string)
                 The endpoint type. The valid values are EDGE  for  edge-opti-
                 mized  API  setup, most suitable for mobile applications; RE-
                 GIONAL for regional API endpoint  setup,  most  suitable  for
                 calling from AWS Region; and PRIVATE for private APIs.

          vpcEndpointIds -> (list)
              A  list of VpcEndpointIds of an API ( RestApi ) against which to
              create Route53 ALIASes. It is only supported  for  PRIVATE  end-
              point type.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          types=string,string,vpcEndpointIds=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "types": ["REGIONAL"|"EDGE"|"PRIVATE", ...],
            "vpcEndpointIds": ["string", ...]
          }

       --tags (map)
          The   key-value   map   of  strings.  The  valid  character  set  is
          [a-zA-Z+-=._:/]. The tag key can be up to 128  characters  and  must
          not start with aws: . The tag value can be up to 256 characters.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --security-policy (string)
          The  Transport  Layer Security (TLS) version + cipher suite for this
          DomainName . The valid values are TLS_1_0 and TLS_1_2 .

          Possible values:

          o TLS_1_0

          o TLS_1_2

       --mutual-tls-authentication (structure)
          If specified, API Gateway performs  two-way  authentication  between
          the  client  and the server. Clients must present a trusted certifi-
          cate to access your custom domain name.

          truststoreUri -> (string)
              An Amazon S3 resource ARN that specifies the truststore for  mu-
              tual  TLS authentication, for example, s3://bucket-name/key-name
              . The truststore can contain certificates from public or private
              certificate  authorities. To update the truststore, upload a new
              version to S3, and then update your custom domain  name  to  use
              the new version. To update the truststore, you must have permis-
              sions to access the S3 object.

          truststoreVersion -> (string)
              The version of the S3 object that contains your  truststore.  To
              specify  a  version, you must have versioning enabled for the S3
              bucket.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          truststoreUri=string,truststoreVersion=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "truststoreUri": "string",
            "truststoreVersion": "string"
          }

       --ownership-verification-certificate-arn (string)
          The ARN of the public certificate issued by ACM to  validate  owner-
          ship  of  your  custom domain. Only required when configuring mutual
          TLS and using an ACM imported or private CA certificate ARN  as  the
          regionalCertificateArn.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       mutualTlsAuthentication -> (structure)
          The  mutual  TLS  authentication  configuration  for a custom domain
          name. If specified, API Gateway performs two-way authentication  be-
          tween the client and the server. Clients must present a trusted cer-
          tificate to access your API.

          truststoreUri -> (string)
              An Amazon S3 URL that specifies the truststore  for  mutual  TLS

              truststore can contain certificates from public or private  cer-
              tificate  authorities.  To  update  the truststore, upload a new
              version to S3, and then update your custom domain  name  to  use
              the new version. To update the truststore, you must have permis-
              sions to access the S3 object.

          truststoreVersion -> (string)
              The version of the S3 object that contains your  truststore.  To

              bucket.

          truststoreWarnings -> (list)
              A list of warnings that API  Gateway  returns  while  processing
              your  truststore.  Invalid certificates produce warnings. Mutual
              TLS is still enabled, but some clients might not be able to  ac-
              cess  your  API. To resolve warnings, upload a new truststore to
              S3, and then update you domain name to use the new version.

              (string)

       ownershipVerificationCertificateArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the public certificate issued by ACM to  validate  owner-
          ship  of  your  custom domain. Only required when configuring mutual

          regionalCertificateArn.
