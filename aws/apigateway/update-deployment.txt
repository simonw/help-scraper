DESCRIPTION
       Changes information about a  Deployment resource.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-deployment
          --rest-api-id <value>
          --deployment-id <value>
          [--patch-operations <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          [Required] The string identifier of the associated  RestApi .

       --deployment-id (string)
          The  replacement  identifier  for the  Deployment resource to change
          information about.

       --patch-operations (list)
          A list of update operations to be applied to the specified  resource
          and in the order specified in this list.

          (structure)
              A  single  patch  operation  to apply to the specified resource.
              Please refer to http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902#section-4 for
              an explanation of how each operation is used.

              op -> (string)
                 An  update operation to be performed with this PATCH request.
                 The valid value can be add , remove , replace or copy  .  Not
                 all valid operations are supported for a given resource. Sup-
                 port of the operations depends on specific  operational  con-
                 texts.  Attempts  to  apply an unsupported operation on a re-
                 source will return an error message.

              path -> (string)
                 The op operation's target, as identified by  a  JSON  Pointer
                 value  that  references  a  location  within the targeted re-
                 source. For example, if the target resource has an updateable
                 property  of {"name":"value"} , the path for this property is
                 /name . If the name property value is a  JSON  object  (e.g.,
                 {"name":  {"child/name":  "child-value"}} ), the path for the
                 child/name property will be  /name/child~1name  .  Any  slash
                 ("/")  character appearing in path names must be escaped with
                 "~1", as shown in the example above. Each  op  operation  can
                 have only one path associated with it.

              value -> (string)
                 The  new target value of the update operation. It is applica-
                 ble for the add or replace operation. When using AWS  CLI  to
                 update  a  property  of a JSON value, enclose the JSON object
                 with a pair of single quotes in a Linux shell,  e.g.,  '{"a":
                 ...}'. In a Windows shell, see Using JSON for Parameters .

              from -> (string)
                 The  copy  update  operation's  source  as  identified  by  a
                 JSON-Pointer value referencing the location within  the  tar-
                 geted  resource  to copy the value from. For example, to pro-
                 mote a canary deployment, you copy the canary  deployment  ID
                 to the affiliated deployment ID by calling a PATCH request on
                 a  Stage  resource  with  "op":"copy"  ,  "from":"/canarySet-
                 tings/deploymentId" and "path":"/deploymentId" .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          op=string,path=string,value=string,from=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "op": "add"|"remove"|"replace"|"move"|"copy"|"test",
              "path": "string",
              "value": "string",
              "from": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
