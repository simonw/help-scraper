NAME
       get-documentation-part -

DESCRIPTION
       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-documentation-part
          --rest-api-id <value>
          --documentation-part-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          [Required] The string identifier of the associated  RestApi .

       --documentation-part-id (string)
          [Required] The string identifier of the associated  RestApi .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       id -> (string)
          The  DocumentationPart identifier, generated by API Gateway when the
          DocumentationPart is created.

       location -> (structure)
          The  location  of the API entity to which the documentation applies.
          Valid fields depend on the targeted API entity type. All  the  valid
          location  fields  are  not  required. If not explicitly specified, a
          valid location field is treated as a wildcard and  associated  docu-
          mentation  content  may  be  inherited  by matching entities, unless
          overridden.

          type -> (string)
              [Required] The type of API entity  to  which  the  documentation
              content applies. Valid values are API , AUTHORIZER , MODEL , RE-
              SOURCE  ,  METHOD  ,  PATH_PARAMETER  ,  QUERY_PARAMETER  ,  RE-
              QUEST_HEADER  ,  REQUEST_BODY , RESPONSE , RESPONSE_HEADER , and
              RESPONSE_BODY . Content inheritance does not apply to any entity
              of the API , AUTHORIZER , METHOD , MODEL , REQUEST_BODY , or RE-
              SOURCE type.

          path -> (string)
              The URL path of the target. It is a valid field for the API  en-
              tity types of RESOURCE , METHOD , PATH_PARAMETER , QUERY_PARAME-
              TER , REQUEST_HEADER , REQUEST_BODY , RESPONSE , RESPONSE_HEADER
              ,  and  RESPONSE_BODY  . The default value is / for the root re-
              source. When an applicable child entity inherits the content  of
              another entity of the same type with more general specifications
              of the other location attributes, the child entity's path attri-
              bute must match that of the parent entity as a prefix.

          method -> (string)
              The  HTTP  verb of a method. It is a valid field for the API en-
              tity types of METHOD , PATH_PARAMETER ,  QUERY_PARAMETER  ,  RE-
              QUEST_HEADER  ,  REQUEST_BODY , RESPONSE , RESPONSE_HEADER , and
              RESPONSE_BODY . The default value is * for any method.  When  an
              applicable child entity inherits the content of an entity of the
              same type with more general specifications of the other location
              attributes,  the child entity's method attribute must match that
              of the parent entity exactly.

          statusCode -> (string)
              The HTTP status code of a response. It is a valid field for  the
              API  entity  types  of  RESPONSE  ,  RESPONSE_HEADER  ,  and RE-
              SPONSE_BODY . The default value is * for any status  code.  When
              an  applicable child entity inherits the content of an entity of
              the same type with more general specifications of the other  lo-
              cation  attributes, the child entity's statusCode attribute must
              match that of the parent entity exactly.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the targeted API entity. It is a valid and  required
              field  for the API entity types of AUTHORIZER , MODEL , PATH_PA-
              RAMETER , QUERY_PARAMETER , REQUEST_HEADER  ,  REQUEST_BODY  and
              RESPONSE_HEADER  .  It  is an invalid field for any other entity
              type.

       properties -> (string)
          A content map of API-specific key-value pairs  describing  the  tar-
          geted API entity. The map must be encoded as a JSON string, e.g., "{
          \"description\": \"The API does ...\" }"  .  Only  OpenAPI-compliant
          documentation-related  fields  from  the  propertiesmap are exported
          and, hence, published as part of the API entity  definitions,  while
          the original documentation parts are exported in a OpenAPI extension
          of x-amazon-apigateway-documentation .
