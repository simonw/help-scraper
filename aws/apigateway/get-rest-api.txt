GET-REST-API()                                                  GET-REST-API()



NAME
       get-rest-api -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the RestApi resource in the collection.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-rest-api
          --rest-api-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          The string identifier of the associated RestApi.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about an API

       Command:

          aws apigateway get-rest-api --rest-api-id 1234123412

       Output:

          {
              "name": "myAPI",
              "id": "o1y243m4f5",
              "createdDate": 1453416433
          }

OUTPUT
       id -> (string)
          The API's identifier. This identifier is unique across all  of  your
          APIs in API Gateway.

       name -> (string)
          The API's name.

       description -> (string)
          The API's description.

       createdDate -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp when the API was created.

       version -> (string)
          A version identifier for the API.

       warnings -> (list)
          The  warning messages reported when failonwarnings is turned on dur-
          ing API import.

          (string)

       binaryMediaTypes -> (list)
          The list of binary media types supported by the RestApi. By default,
          the RestApi supports only UTF-8-encoded text payloads.

          (string)

       minimumCompressionSize -> (integer)
          A nullable integer that is used to enable compression (with non-neg-
          ative between 0 and 10485760 (10M) bytes, inclusive) or disable com-
          pression (with a null value) on an API. When compression is enabled,
          compression or decompression is not applied on the  payload  if  the
          payload  size  is smaller than this value. Setting it to zero allows
          compression for any payload size.

       apiKeySource -> (string)
          The source of the API key for metering requests according to a usage
          plan.  Valid  values  are:  >``HEADER`` to read the API key from the
          X-API-Key header of a request. AUTHORIZER to read the API  key  from
          the UsageIdentifierKey from a custom authorizer.

       endpointConfiguration -> (structure)
          The  endpoint  configuration  of  this  RestApi showing the endpoint
          types of the API.

          types -> (list)
              A list of endpoint types of an API (RestApi) or its  custom  do-
              main name (DomainName). For an edge-optimized API and its custom
              domain name, the endpoint type is "EDGE" . For  a  regional  API
              and  its custom domain name, the endpoint type is REGIONAL . For
              a private API, the endpoint type is PRIVATE .

              (string)
                 The endpoint type. The valid values are EDGE  for  edge-opti-
                 mized  API  setup, most suitable for mobile applications; RE-
                 GIONAL for regional API endpoint  setup,  most  suitable  for
                 calling from AWS Region; and PRIVATE for private APIs.

          vpcEndpointIds -> (list)
              A  list  of  VpcEndpointIds of an API (RestApi) against which to
              create Route53 ALIASes. It is only supported  for  PRIVATE  end-
              point type.

              (string)

       policy -> (string)
          A  stringified JSON policy document that applies to this RestApi re-
          gardless of the caller and Method configuration.

       tags -> (map)
          The collection of tags. Each tag element is associated with a  given
          resource.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       disableExecuteApiEndpoint -> (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  clients can invoke your API by using the default
          execute-api endpoint. By default, clients can invoke your  API  with
          the default https://{api_id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com end-
          point. To require that clients use a custom domain  name  to  invoke
          your API, disable the default endpoint.
