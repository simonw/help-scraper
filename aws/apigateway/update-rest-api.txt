NAME
       update-rest-api -

DESCRIPTION
       Changes information about the specified API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-rest-api
          --rest-api-id <value>
          [--patch-operations <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rest-api-id (string)
          [Required] The string identifier of the associated  RestApi .

       --patch-operations (list)
          A  list of update operations to be applied to the specified resource
          and in the order specified in this list.

          (structure)
              A single patch operation to apply  to  the  specified  resource.
              Please refer to http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902#section-4 for
              an explanation of how each operation is used.

              op -> (string)
                 An update operation to be performed with this PATCH  request.
                 The  valid  value can be add , remove , replace or copy . Not
                 all valid operations are supported for a given resource. Sup-
                 port  of  the operations depends on specific operational con-
                 texts. Attempts to apply an unsupported operation  on  a  re-
                 source will return an error message.

              path -> (string)
                 The  op  operation's  target, as identified by a JSON Pointer
                 value that references a  location  within  the  targeted  re-
                 source. For example, if the target resource has an updateable
                 property of {"name":"value"} , the path for this property  is
                 /name  .  If  the name property value is a JSON object (e.g.,
                 {"name": {"child/name": "child-value"}} ), the path  for  the
                 child/name  property  will  be  /name/child~1name . Any slash
                 ("/") character appearing in path names must be escaped  with
                 "~1",  as  shown  in the example above. Each op operation can
                 have only one path associated with it.

              value -> (string)
                 The new target value of the update operation. It is  applica-
                 ble  for  the add or replace operation. When using AWS CLI to
                 update a property of a JSON value, enclose  the  JSON  object
                 with  a  pair of single quotes in a Linux shell, e.g., '{"a":
                 ...}'. In a Windows shell, see Using JSON for Parameters .

              from -> (string)
                 The  copy  update  operation's  source  as  identified  by  a
                 JSON-Pointer  value  referencing the location within the tar-
                 geted resource to copy the value from. For example,  to  pro-
                 mote  a  canary deployment, you copy the canary deployment ID
                 to the affiliated deployment ID by calling a PATCH request on
                 a   Stage  resource  with  "op":"copy"  , "from":"/canarySet-
                 tings/deploymentId" and "path":"/deploymentId" .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          op=string,path=string,value=string,from=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "op": "add"|"remove"|"replace"|"move"|"copy"|"test",
              "path": "string",
              "value": "string",
              "from": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To change the name of an API

       Command:

          aws apigateway update-rest-api --rest-api-id 1234123412 --patch-operations op=replace,path=/name,value='New Name'

       To change the description of an API

       Command:

          aws apigateway update-rest-api --rest-api-id 1234123412 --patch-operations op=replace,path=/description,value='New Description'

OUTPUT
       id -> (string)
          The  API's  identifier. This identifier is unique across all of your
          APIs in API Gateway.

       name -> (string)
          The API's name.

       description -> (string)
          The API's description.

       createdDate -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp when the API was created.

       version -> (string)
          A version identifier for the API.

       warnings -> (list)
          The warning messages reported when failonwarnings is turned on  dur-
          ing API import.

          (string)

       binaryMediaTypes -> (list)
          The  list  of  binary media types supported by the  RestApi . By de-
          fault, the  RestApi supports only UTF-8-encoded text payloads.

          (string)

       minimumCompressionSize -> (integer)
          A nullable integer that is used to enable compression (with non-neg-
          ative between 0 and 10485760 (10M) bytes, inclusive) or disable com-
          pression (with a null value) on an API. When compression is enabled,
          compression  or  decompression  is not applied on the payload if the
          payload size is smaller than this value. Setting it to  zero  allows
          compression for any payload size.

       apiKeySource -> (string)
          The source of the API key for metering requests according to a usage
          plan. Valid values are:

          o HEADER to read the API key from the X-API-Key header of a request.

          o AUTHORIZER to read the API key from the UsageIdentifierKey from  a
            custom authorizer.

       endpointConfiguration -> (structure)
          The  endpoint  configuration  of  this  RestApi showing the endpoint
          types of the API.

          types -> (list)
              A list of endpoint types of an API ( RestApi ) or its custom do-
              main name ( DomainName ). For an edge-optimized API and its cus-
              tom domain name, the endpoint type is "EDGE" .  For  a  regional
              API  and its custom domain name, the endpoint type is REGIONAL .
              For a private API, the endpoint type is PRIVATE .

              (string)
                 The endpoint type. The valid values are EDGE  for  edge-opti-
                 mized  API  setup, most suitable for mobile applications; RE-
                 GIONAL for regional API endpoint  setup,  most  suitable  for
                 calling from AWS Region; and PRIVATE for private APIs.

          vpcEndpointIds -> (list)
              A  list of VpcEndpointIds of an API ( RestApi ) against which to
              create Route53 ALIASes. It is only supported  for  PRIVATE  end-
              point type.

              (string)

       policy -> (string)
          A  stringified JSON policy document that applies to this RestApi re-
          gardless of the caller and  Method configuration.

       tags -> (map)
          The collection of tags. Each tag element is associated with a  given
          resource.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       disableExecuteApiEndpoint -> (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  clients can invoke your API by using the default
          execute-api endpoint. By default, clients can invoke your  API  with
          the default https://{api_id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com end-
          point. To require that clients use a custom domain  name  to  invoke
          your API, disable the default endpoint.
