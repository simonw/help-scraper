GET-DOMAIN-NAME()                                            GET-DOMAIN-NAME()



NAME
       get-domain-name -

DESCRIPTION
       Represents a domain name that is contained in a simpler, more intuitive
       URL that can be called.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-domain-name
          --domain-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          [Required] The name of the  DomainName resource.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a custom domain name

       Command:

          aws apigateway get-domain-name --domain-name api.domain.tld

       Output:

          {
              "domainName": "api.domain.tld",
              "distributionDomainName": "d1a2f3a4c5o6d.cloudfront.net",
              "certificateName": "uploadedCertificate",
              "certificateUploadDate": 1462565487
          }

OUTPUT
       domainName -> (string)
          The  custom domain name as an API host name, for example, my-api.ex-
          ample.com .

       certificateName -> (string)
          The name of the certificate that will be used by edge-optimized end-
          point for this domain name.

       certificateArn -> (string)
          The  reference  to  an  AWS-managed certificate that will be used by
          edge-optimized endpoint for this domain name. AWS  Certificate  Man-
          ager is the only supported source.

       certificateUploadDate -> (timestamp)
          The  timestamp  when the certificate that was used by edge-optimized
          endpoint for this domain name was uploaded.

       regionalDomainName -> (string)
          The domain name associated with the regional endpoint for this  cus-
          tom  domain name. You set up this association by adding a DNS record
          that points the custom domain name to this regional domain name. The
          regional  domain  name  is returned by API Gateway when you create a
          regional endpoint.

       regionalHostedZoneId -> (string)
          The region-specific Amazon Route 53 Hosted Zone ID of  the  regional
          endpoint.  For more information, see Set up a Regional Custom Domain
          Name and AWS Regions and Endpoints for API Gateway .

       regionalCertificateName -> (string)
          The name of the certificate that will be used for validating the re-
          gional domain name.

       regionalCertificateArn -> (string)
          The  reference  to  an AWS-managed certificate that will be used for
          validating the regional domain name. AWS Certificate Manager is  the
          only supported source.

       distributionDomainName -> (string)
          The  domain  name  of  the Amazon CloudFront distribution associated
          with this custom domain name for an edge-optimized endpoint. You set
          up this association when adding a DNS record pointing the custom do-
          main name to this distribution  name.  For  more  information  about
          CloudFront distributions, see the Amazon CloudFront documentation .

       distributionHostedZoneId -> (string)
          The region-agnostic Amazon Route 53 Hosted Zone ID of the edge-opti-
          mized endpoint. The valid value is Z2FDTNDATAQYW2 for  all  the  re-
          gions.  For  more  information,  see Set up a Regional Custom Domain
          Name and AWS Regions and Endpoints for API Gateway .

       endpointConfiguration -> (structure)
          The endpoint configuration of this  DomainName showing the  endpoint
          types of the domain name.

          types -> (list)
              A list of endpoint types of an API ( RestApi ) or its custom do-
              main name ( DomainName ). For an edge-optimized API and its cus-
              tom  domain  name,  the endpoint type is "EDGE" . For a regional
              API and its custom domain name, the endpoint type is REGIONAL  .
              For a private API, the endpoint type is PRIVATE .

              (string)
                 The  endpoint  type. The valid values are EDGE for edge-opti-
                 mized API setup, most suitable for mobile  applications;  RE-
                 GIONAL  for  regional  API  endpoint setup, most suitable for
                 calling from AWS Region; and PRIVATE for private APIs.

          vpcEndpointIds -> (list)
              A list of VpcEndpointIds of an API ( RestApi ) against which  to
              create  Route53  ALIASes.  It is only supported for PRIVATE end-
              point type.

              (string)

       domainNameStatus -> (string)
          The status of the  DomainName migration. The valid values are AVAIL-
          ABLE  , UPDATING , PENDING_CERTIFICATE_REIMPORT , and PENDING_OWNER-
          SHIP_VERIFICATION . If the status is UPDATING , the domain cannot be
          modified  further until the existing operation is complete. If it is
          AVAILABLE , the domain can be updated.

       domainNameStatusMessage -> (string)
          An optional text message containing detailed information about  sta-
          tus of the  DomainName migration.

       securityPolicy -> (string)
          The  Transport  Layer Security (TLS) version + cipher suite for this
          DomainName . The valid values are TLS_1_0 and TLS_1_2 .

       tags -> (map)
          The collection of tags. Each tag element is associated with a  given
          resource.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       mutualTlsAuthentication -> (structure)
          The  mutual  TLS  authentication  configuration  for a custom domain
          name. If specified, API Gateway performs two-way authentication  be-
          tween the client and the server. Clients must present a trusted cer-
          tificate to access your API.

          truststoreUri -> (string)
              An Amazon S3 URL that specifies the truststore  for  mutual  TLS
              authentication,  for  example  s3://bucket-name/key-name  .  The
              truststore can contain certificates from public or private  cer-
              tificate  authorities.  To  update  the truststore, upload a new
              version to S3, and then update your custom domain  name  to  use
              the new version. To update the truststore, you must have permis-
              sions to access the S3 object.

          truststoreVersion -> (string)
              The version of the S3 object that contains your  truststore.  To
              specify  a  version, you must have versioning enabled for the S3
              bucket.

          truststoreWarnings -> (list)
              A list of warnings that API  Gateway  returns  while  processing
              your  truststore.  Invalid certificates produce warnings. Mutual
              TLS is still enabled, but some clients might not be able to  ac-
              cess  your  API. To resolve warnings, upload a new truststore to
              S3, and then update you domain name to use the new version.

              (string)

       ownershipVerificationCertificateArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the public certificate issued by ACM to  validate  owner-
          ship  of  your  custom domain. Only required when configuring mutual
          TLS and using an ACM imported or private CA certificate ARN  as  the
          regionalCertificateArn.
