START-CHANGE-SET()                                          START-CHANGE-SET()



NAME
       start-change-set -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation allows you to request changes for your entities. Within
       a single ChangeSet, you cannot start the same change type  against  the
       same  entity multiple times. Additionally, when a ChangeSet is running,
       all the entities targeted by the different changes are locked until the
       ChangeSet  has  completed  (either succeeded, cancelled, or failed). If
       you try to start a ChangeSet containing a change against an entity that
       is already locked, you will receive a ResourceInUseException .

       For  example,  you  cannot start the ChangeSet described in the example
       later in this topic, because it contains two  changes  to  execute  the
       same  change type (AddRevisions ) against the same entity (entity-id@1)
       .

       For more information about working with change sets, see  Working  with
       change sets .

          --change-set <value>
          [--change-set-name <value>]
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog (string)
          The catalog related to the request. Fixed value: AWSMarketplace

       --change-set (list)
          Array of change object.

          (structure)

              ChangeType -> (string)
                 Change  types are single string values that describe your in-
                 tention for the change. Each change type is unique  for  each
                 EntityType provided in the change's scope.

              Entity -> (structure)
                 The entity to be changed.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of entity.

                 Identifier -> (string)
                     The identifier for the entity.

              Details -> (string)
                 This  object  contains details specific to the change type of
                 the requested change.

              ChangeName -> (string)
                 Optional name for the change.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ChangeType=string,Entity={Type=string,Identifier=string},Details=string,ChangeName=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ChangeType": "string",
              "Entity": {
                "Type": "string",
                "Identifier": "string"
              },
              "Details": "string",
              "ChangeName": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --change-set-name (string)
          Optional case sensitive string of up to 100  ASCII  characters.  The
          change set name can be used to filter the list of change sets.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique token to identify the request to ensure idempotency.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ChangeSetId -> (string)
          Unique identifier generated for the request.

       ChangeSetArn -> (string)
          The ARN associated to the unique identifier generated  for  the  re-
          quest.
