OPTIONS
       --catalog (string)
          The catalog related to the request. Fixed value: AWSMarketplace

       --entity-type (string)
          The type of entities to retrieve.

       --filter-list (list)
          An  array  of  filter  objects.  Each filter object contains two at-
          tributes, filterName and filterValues .

          (structure)
              A filter object, used to optionally filter results from calls to
              the ListEntities and ListChangeSets actions.

              Name -> (string)
                 For  ListEntities  , the supported value for this is an Enti-
                 tyId .

                 For ListChangeSets , the supported values are as follows:

              ValueList -> (list)
                     ListEntities - This is a list of unique EntityId s.

                     ListChangeSets - The supported filter names  and  associ-
                     ated ValueList s is as follows:

                 o ChangeSetName  -  The  supported  ValueList  is  a  list of
                   non-unique ChangeSetName s. These are defined when you call
                   the StartChangeSet action.

                 o Status  - The supported ValueList is a list of statuses for
                   all change set requests.

                 o EntityId - The supported ValueList is a list of unique  En-
                   tityId s.

                 o BeforeStartTime  - The supported ValueList is a list of all
                   change sets that started before the filter value.

                 o AfterStartTime - The supported ValueList is a list  of  all
                   change sets that started after the filter value.

                 o BeforeEndTime  -  The  supported ValueList is a list of all
                   change sets that ended before the filter value.

                 o AfterEndTime - The supported ValueList is  a  list  of  all
                   change sets that ended after the filter value.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,ValueList=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "ValueList": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --sort (structure)
          An object that contains two attributes, SortBy and SortOrder .

          SortBy -> (string)
              For ListEntities , supported attributes include LastModifiedDate
              (default), Visibility , EntityId , and Name .

              For ListChangeSets , supported attributes include StartTime  and
              EndTime .

          SortOrder -> (string)
              The  sorting order. Can be ASCENDING or DESCENDING . The default
              value is DESCENDING .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SortBy=string,SortOrder=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SortBy": "string",
            "SortOrder": "ASCENDING"|"DESCENDING"
          }

       --next-token (string)
          The value of the next token, if it exists. Null if there are no more
          results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies  the  upper  limit  of the elements on a single page. If a
          value isn't provided, the default value is 20.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          (structure)

              the entity. The summary doesn't contain the whole entity  struc-

              ties.

              Name -> (string)

              EntityType -> (string)

              EntityId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the entity.

              EntityArn -> (string)
                 The ARN associated with the unique identifier for the entity.

              LastModifiedDate -> (string)
                 The last time the entity was published, using ISO 8601 format
                 (2018-02-27T13:45:22Z).

              Visibility -> (string)
                 The visibility status of the entity to buyers. This value can
                 be Public (everyone can view the entity), Limited (the entity
                 is visible to limited accounts only), or Restricted (the  en-
                 tity  was  published  and  then unpublished and only existing
                 buyers can view it).

       NextToken -> (string)
          The value of the next token if it exists. Null if there is  no  more
