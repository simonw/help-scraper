LIST-NOTIFICATION-RULES()                            LIST-NOTIFICATION-RULES()



NAME
       list-notification-rules -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of the notification rules for an AWS account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-notification-rules  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: NotificationRules

SYNOPSIS
            list-notification-rules
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          The filters to use to return  information  by  service  or  resource
          type. For valid values, see  ListNotificationRulesFilter .

          NOTE:
              A  filter with the same name can appear more than once when used
              with OR statements. Filters with different names should  be  ap-
              plied with AND statements.

          (structure)
              Information  about a filter to apply to the list of returned no-
              tification rules. You can filter by event type, owner, resource,
              or target.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name  of the attribute you want to use to filter the re-
                 turned notification rules.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the attribute you want to use to filter the  re-
                 turned  notification  rules. For example, if you specify fil-
                 tering by RESOURCE in Name, you might specify the  ARN  of  a
                 pipeline in AWS CodePipeline for the value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "EVENT_TYPE_ID"|"CREATED_BY"|"RESOURCE"|"TARGET_ADDRESS",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve a list of notification rules

       The following list-notification-rules example retrieves a list  of  all
       notification rules in the specified AWS Region.

          aws codestar-notifications list-notification-rules --region us-east-1

       Output:

          {
              "NotificationRules": [
                  {
                      "Id": "dc82df7a-EXAMPLE",
                      "Arn": "arn:aws:codestar-notifications:us-east-1:123456789012:notificationrule/dc82df7a-EXAMPLE"
                  },
                  {
                      "Id": "8d1f0983-EXAMPLE",
                      "Arn": "arn:aws:codestar-notifications:us-east-1:123456789012:notificationrule/8d1f0983-EXAMPLE"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Tools Console User Guide.
