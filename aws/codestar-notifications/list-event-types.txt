LIST-EVENT-TYPES()                                          LIST-EVENT-TYPES()



NAME
       list-event-types -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about the event types available for configuring no-
       tifications.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-event-types is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: EventTypes

SYNOPSIS
            list-event-types
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          The  filters  to  use  to  return information by service or resource
          type.

          (structure)
              Information about a filter to apply  to  the  list  of  returned
              event types. You can filter by resource type or service name.

              Name -> (string)
                 The system-generated name of the filter type you want to fil-
                 ter by.

              Value -> (string)
                 The name of the resource type (for example, pipeline) or ser-
                 vice name (for example, CodePipeline) that you want to filter
                 by.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "RESOURCE_TYPE"|"SERVICE_NAME",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a list of event types for a notification rule

       The following list-event-types example retrieves a filtered list of all
       available  notification event types for CodeDeploy applications. If in-
       stead you use no filter, the command  returns  all  notification  event
       types for all resource types.

          aws codestar-notifications list-event-types \
              --filters Name=SERVICE_NAME,Value=CodeDeploy

       Output:

          {
              "EventTypes": [
                  {
                      "EventTypeId": "codedeploy-application-deployment-succeeded",
                      "ServiceName": "CodeDeploy",
                      "EventTypeName": "Deployment: Succeeded",
                      "ResourceType": "Application"
                  },
                  {
                      "EventTypeId": "codedeploy-application-deployment-failed",
                      "ServiceName": "CodeDeploy",
                      "EventTypeName": "Deployment: Failed",
                      "ResourceType": "Application"
                  },
                  {
                      "EventTypeId": "codedeploy-application-deployment-started",
                      "ServiceName": "CodeDeploy",
                      "EventTypeName": "Deployment: Started",
                      "ResourceType": "Application"
                  }
              ]
          }
