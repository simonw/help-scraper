LIST-TARGETS()                                                  LIST-TARGETS()



NAME
       list-targets -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of the notification rule targets for an AWS account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-targets is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Targets

SYNOPSIS
            list-targets
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          The filters to use to return  information  by  service  or  resource
          type.  Valid filters include target type, target address, and target
          status.

          NOTE:
              A filter with the same name can appear more than once when  used
              with  OR  statements. Filters with different names should be ap-
              plied with AND statements.

          (structure)
              Information about a filter to apply to the list of returned tar-
              gets. You can filter by target type, address, or status. For ex-
              ample, to filter results to notification rules that have  active
              Amazon  SNS  topics as targets, you could specify a ListTargets-
              Filter Name as TargetType and a Value of SNS, and a Name of TAR-
              GET_STATUS and a Value of ACTIVE.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name  of the attribute you want to use to filter the re-
                 turned targets.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the attribute you want to use to filter the  re-
                 turned  targets. For example, if you specify SNS for the Tar-
                 get type, you could specify an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for
                 a topic as the value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "TARGET_TYPE"|"TARGET_ADDRESS"|"TARGET_STATUS",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The following list-targets example retrieves a list of all notification
       rule targets in the specified AWS Region.

              --region us-east-1

          {
              "Targets": [
                  {
                      "TargetAddress": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:MySNSTopicForNotificationRules",
                      "TargetType": "SNS",
                      "TargetStatus": "ACTIVE"
                  },
                  {
                      "TargetAddress": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:MySNSTopicForNotificationsAboutMyDemoRepo",
                      "TargetType": "SNS",
                      "TargetStatus": "ACTIVE"
                  }
              ]
          }
