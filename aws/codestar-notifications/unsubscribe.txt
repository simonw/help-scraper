UNSUBSCRIBE()                                                    UNSUBSCRIBE()



NAME
       unsubscribe -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  an  association  between a notification rule and an Amazon SNS
       topic so that subscribers to that topic  stop  receiving  notifications
       when the events described in the rule are triggered.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            unsubscribe
          --arn <value>
          --target-address <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the notification rule.

       --target-address (string)
          The ARN of the SNS topic to unsubscribe from the notification rule.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To remove a target from a notification rule

       The following unsubscribe example removes an Amazon SNS topic as a tar-
       get from the specified notification rule.

          aws codestar-notifications unsubscribe \
              --arn arn:aws:codestar-notifications:us-east-1:123456789012:notificationrule/dc82df7a-EXAMPLE \
              --target TargetType=SNS,TargetAddress=arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:MyNotificationTopic

       Output:

          {
              "Arn": "arn:aws:codestar-notifications:us-east-1:123456789012:notificationrule/dc82df7a-EXAMPLE"
              "TargetAddress": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:MyNotificationTopic"
          }
