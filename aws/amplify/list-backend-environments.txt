DESCRIPTION
       Lists the backend environments for an Amplify app.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-backend-environments
          --app-id <value>
          [--environment-name <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --app-id (string)
          The unique ID for an Amplify app.

       --environment-name (string)
          The name of the backend environment

       --next-token (string)
          A  pagination  token.  Set to null to start listing backend environ-
          ments from the start. If a non-null pagination token is returned  in
          a result, pass its value in here to list more backend environments.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of records to list in a single response.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
