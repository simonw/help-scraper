       --environment-variables (map)
          The environment variables for the branch.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

            ...}

       --basic-auth-credentials (string)
          The  basic  authorization  credentials  for  the  branch.  You  must

          Enables basic authorization for the branch.

       --enable-performance-mode | --no-enable-performance-mode (boolean)
          Enables performance mode for the branch.

          Performance mode optimizes for faster hosting performance by keeping
          content cached at the edge for a longer interval.  When  performance
          mode  is  enabled, hosting configuration or code changes can take up
          to 10 minutes to roll out.

          ated from an CloudFormation stack.

          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-

       the string will be taken literally.

       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
