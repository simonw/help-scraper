          --app-id <value>
          --branch-name <value>

       --branch-name (string)
          The name for the branch, for the job.

       --file-map (map)
          An optional file map that contains the file name as the key and  the
          file  content  md5  hash as the value. If this argument is provided,
          the service will generate a unique upload URL per  file.  Otherwise,
          the  service  will  only generate a single upload URL for the zipped
          files.

          key -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
