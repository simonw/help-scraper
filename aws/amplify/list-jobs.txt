LIST-JOBS()                                                        LIST-JOBS()



NAME
       list-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the jobs for a branch of an Amplify app.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation  by  providing  the --no-paginate argument.  When using --output
       text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query  ar-
       gument  must  extract  data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: jobSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-jobs
          --app-id <value>
          --branch-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --app-id (string)
          The unique ID for an Amplify app.

       --branch-name (string)
          The name for a branch.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       jobSummaries -> (list)
          The result structure for the list job result request.

          (structure)
              Describes the summary for an execution job for an Amplify app.

              jobArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the job.

              jobId -> (string)
                 The unique ID for the job.

              commitId -> (string)
                 The  commit ID from a third-party repository provider for the
                 job.

              commitMessage -> (string)
                 The commit message from a third-party repository provider for
                 the job.

              commitTime -> (timestamp)
                 The commit date and time for the job.

              startTime -> (timestamp)
                 The start date and time for the job.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status for the job.

              endTime -> (timestamp)
                 The end date and time for the job.

              jobType -> (string)
                 The  type  for the job. If the value is RELEASE , the job was
                 manually released from its source by using the StartJob  API.
                 If  the  value  is RETRY , the job was manually retried using
                 the StartJob API. If the value is WEB_HOOK , the job was  au-
                 tomatically triggered by webhooks.

       nextToken -> (string)
          A  pagination token. If non-null the pagination token is returned in
          a result. Pass its value in another request  to  retrieve  more  en-
          tries.
