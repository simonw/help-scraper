NAME
       list-deliverability-test-reports -

DESCRIPTION
       Show  a  list  of the predictive inbox placement tests that you've per-
       formed, regardless of their statuses. For  predictive  inbox  placement
       tests  that  are  complete, you can use the GetDeliverabilityTestReport
       operation to view the results.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-deliverability-test-reports is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: DeliverabilityTestReports

SYNOPSIS
            list-deliverability-test-reports
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DeliverabilityTestReports -> (list)
          An object that contains a lists of predictive inbox placement  tests
          that you've performed.

          (structure)
              An  object  that contains metadata related to a predictive inbox
              placement test.

              ReportId -> (string)
                 A unique string that identifies the predictive  inbox  place-
                 ment test.

              ReportName -> (string)
                 A  name  that helps you identify a predictive inbox placement
                 test report.

              Subject -> (string)
                 The subject line for an email that you submitted in a predic-
                 tive inbox placement test.

              FromEmailAddress -> (string)
                 The  sender address that you specified for the predictive in-
                 box placement test.

              CreateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the predictive  inbox  placement  test
                 was created, in Unix time format.

              DeliverabilityTestStatus -> (string)
                 The  status  of  the  predictive inbox placement test. If the
                 status is IN_PROGRESS , then the predictive  inbox  placement
                 test  is  currently running. Predictive inbox placement tests
                 are usually complete within 24 hours of creating the test. If
                 the  status  is COMPLETE , then the test is finished, and you
                 can use the GetDeliverabilityTestReport to view  the  results
                 of the test.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates that there are additional predictive inbox
          placement tests to list. To view additional predictive inbox  place-
          ment tests, issue another request to ListDeliverabilityTestReports ,
          and pass this token in the NextToken parameter.
