SYNOPSIS
            get-domain-statistics-report
          --domain <value>
          --start-date <value>
          --end-date <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The domain that you want to obtain deliverability metrics for.

       --start-date (timestamp)
          The first day (in Unix time) that you want to obtain domain deliver-
          ability metrics for.

       --end-date (timestamp)
          The  last day (in Unix time) that you want to obtain domain deliver-
          ability metrics for. The EndDate that you specify  has  to  be  less
          than or equal to 30 days after the StartDate .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
