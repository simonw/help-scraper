SEND-EMAIL()                                                      SEND-EMAIL()



NAME
       send-email -

DESCRIPTION
       Sends  an  email  message. You can use the Amazon Pinpoint Email API to
       send two types of messages:

       o Simple  A standard email message. When you create this type  of  mes-
         sage,  you  specify  the sender, the recipient, and the message body,
         and Amazon Pinpoint assembles the message for you.

       o Raw  A raw, MIME-formatted email message. When you send this type  of
         email, you have to specify all of the message headers, as well as the
         message body. You can use this message type  to  send  messages  that
         contain  attachments.  The message that you specify has to be a valid
         MIME message.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ToAddresses": ["string", ...],
            "CcAddresses": ["string", ...],
            "BccAddresses": ["string", ...]
          }

       --reply-to-addresses (list)
          The "Reply-to" email addresses for the message. When  the  recipient

       --feedback-forwarding-email-address (string)
          The  address  that  Amazon Pinpoint should send bounce and complaint
          notifications to.

       --content (structure)
          An object that contains the body of the message. You can send either
          a Simple message or a Raw message.

          Simple -> (structure)
              The  simple email message. The message consists of a subject and
              a message body.

              Subject -> (structure)
                 The subject line of the email. The subject line can only con-
                 tain   7-bit  ASCII  characters.  However,  you  can  specify
                 non-ASCII  characters  in  the  subject  line  by  using  en-
                 coded-word syntax, as described in RFC 2047 .

                 Data -> (string)
                     The content of the message itself.

                 Charset -> (string)
                     The  character  set  for the content. Because of the con-
                     straints of the SMTP protocol, Amazon Pinpoint uses 7-bit
                     ASCII by default. If the text includes characters outside
                     of the ASCII range, you have to specify a character  set.
                     For  example,  you  could specify UTF-8 , ISO-8859-1 , or
                     Shift_JIS .

              Body -> (structure)
                 The body of the message. You can specify an HTML  version  of
                 the message, a text-only version of the message, or both.

                 Text -> (structure)
                     An object that represents the version of the message that
                     is displayed in email clients that don't support HTML, or
                     clients where the recipient has disabled HTML rendering.

                     Data -> (string)
                        The content of the message itself.

                     Charset -> (string)
                        The character set for the content. Because of the con-
                        straints of the SMTP protocol,  Amazon  Pinpoint  uses
                        7-bit  ASCII  by default. If the text includes charac-
                        ters outside of the ASCII range, you have to specify a
                        character  set. For example, you could specify UTF-8 ,
                        ISO-8859-1 , or Shift_JIS .

                 Html -> (structure)
                     An object that represents the version of the message that
                     is  displayed  in  email  clients that support HTML. HTML
                     messages can include formatted text, hyperlinks,  images,
                     and more.

                     Data -> (string)
                        The content of the message itself.

                     Charset -> (string)
                        The character set for the content. Because of the con-
                        straints of the SMTP protocol,  Amazon  Pinpoint  uses
                        7-bit  ASCII  by default. If the text includes charac-
                        ters outside of the ASCII range, you have to specify a
                        character  set. For example, you could specify UTF-8 ,
                        ISO-8859-1 , or Shift_JIS .

          Raw -> (structure)
              The raw email message. The message has  to  meet  the  following
              criteria:

              o The  message  has to contain a header and a body, separated by
                one blank line.

              o All of the required header fields must be present in the  mes-
                sage.

              o Each  part of a multipart MIME message must be formatted prop-
                erly.

              o If you include attachments, they must be in a file format that
                Amazon Pinpoint supports.

              o The entire message must be Base64 encoded.

              o If  any of the MIME parts in your message contain content that
                is outside of the 7-bit ASCII character range, you should  en-
                code  that  content  to  ensure that recipients' email clients
                render the message properly.

              o The length of any single line of text in the message can't ex-
                ceed 1,000 characters. This restriction is defined in RFC 5321
                .

              Data -> (blob)
                 The raw email message. The message has to meet the  following
                 criteria:

                 o The  message  has to contain a header and a body, separated
                   by one blank line.

                 o All of the required header fields must be  present  in  the
                   message.

                 o Each  part  of  a  multipart MIME message must be formatted
                   properly.

                 o Attachments must be in a file format that  Amazon  Pinpoint
                   supports.

                 o The entire message must be Base64 encoded.

                 o If  any  of  the MIME parts in your message contain content
                   that is outside of the 7-bit  ASCII  character  range,  you
                   should encode that content to ensure that recipients' email
                   clients render the message properly.

                 o The length of any single line of text in the message  can't
                   exceed 1,000 characters. This restriction is defined in RFC
                   5321 .

          Template -> (structure)
              The template to use for the email message.

              TemplateArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the template.

              TemplateData -> (string)
                 An object that defines the values to use  for  message  vari-
                 ables  in  the  template.  This  object is a set of key-value
                 pairs. Each key defines a message variable in  the  template.
                 The  corresponding  value  defines  the value to use for that
                 variable.

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"

          the email.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       MessageId -> (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for the message that is generated when Amazon
          Pinpoint accepts the message.

          NOTE:
              It is possible for Amazon Pinpoint to accept a  message  without
              sending  it.  This  can happen when the message you're trying to
              send has an attachment doesn't pass a virus check, or  when  you
              send  a  templated  email  that contains invalid personalization
              content, for example.
