DESCRIPTION
       Enable or disable the Deliverability dashboard for your Amazon Pinpoint
       account. When you enable the Deliverability dashboard, you gain  access
       to  reputation,  deliverability, and other metrics for the domains that
       you use to send email using Amazon Pinpoint. You also gain the  ability
       to perform predictive inbox placement tests.

       When  you use the Deliverability dashboard, you pay a monthly subscrip-
       tion charge, in addition to any other fees that  you  accrue  by  using
       Amazon  Pinpoint. For more information about the features and cost of a
       Deliverability dashboard subscription, see Amazon Pinpoint Pricing .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
