NAME
       list-domain-deliverability-campaigns -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve deliverability data for all the campaigns that used a specific
       domain to send email during a specified time range. This data is avail-
       able  for  a  domain  only  if you enabled the Deliverability dashboard
       (PutDeliverabilityDashboardOption operation) for the domain.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-domain-deliverability-campaigns
          --start-date <value>
          --end-date <value>
          --subscribed-domain <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --start-date (timestamp)
          The first day, in Unix time format, that you want to obtain deliver-
          ability data for.

       --end-date (timestamp)
          The  last day, in Unix time format, that you want to obtain deliver-
          ability data for. This value has to be less than or equal to 30 days
          after the value of the StartDate parameter.

       --subscribed-domain (string)
          The domain to obtain deliverability data for.

       --next-token (string)
          A  token thats returned from a previous call to the ListDomainDeliv-
          erabilityCampaigns operation. This token indicates the position of a
          campaign in the list of campaigns.

       --page-size (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  results to include in response to a single
          call to the ListDomainDeliverabilityCampaigns operation. If the num-
          ber  of  results  is larger than the number that you specify in this
          parameter, the response includes a NextToken element, which you  can
          use to obtain additional results.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DomainDeliverabilityCampaigns -> (list)
          An array of responses, one for each campaign that used the domain to
          send email during the specified time range.

          (structure)
              An object that contains the deliverability data for  a  specific
              campaign. This data is available for a campaign only if the cam-
              paign sent email by using a domain that the Deliverability dash-

                 paign. This value is not the same as the campaign  identifier
                 that Amazon Pinpoint assigns to campaigns that you create and
