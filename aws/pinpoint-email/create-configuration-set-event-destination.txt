CREATE-CONFIGURATION-SET-EVENT-DESCREATE-CONFIGURATION-SET-EVENT-DESTINATION()



NAME
       create-configuration-set-event-destination -

DESCRIPTION
       Create an event destination. In Amazon Pinpoint, events include message
       sends, deliveries, opens, clicks, bounces, and complaints. Event desti-
       nations are places that you can send information about these events to.
       For example, you can send event data to Amazon SNS to receive notifica-
       tions when you receive bounces or complaints, or you can use Amazon Ki-
       nesis Data Firehose to stream data to Amazon S3 for long-term storage.

       A single configuration set can include more than one event destination.

          --configuration-set-name <value>
          --event-destination-name <value>
          --event-destination <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --configuration-set-name (string)
          The name of the configuration set that you want to add an event des-
          tination to.

       --event-destination-name (string)
          A  name  that identifies the event destination within the configura-
          tion set.

       --event-destination (structure)
          An object that defines the event destination.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              If true , the event destination is enabled. When the event  des-
              tination  is  enabled, the specified event types are sent to the
              destinations in this EventDestinationDefinition .

              If false , the event destination is  disabled.  When  the  event
              destination  is  disabled,  events  aren't sent to the specified
              destinations.

          MatchingEventTypes -> (list)

              to the destinations in this EventDestinationDefinition .

              (string)
                 An email sending event type. For example, email sends, opens,
                 and bounces are all email events.

              An object that defines an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose  destina-
              tion  for email events. You can use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
              to stream data to other services, such as Amazon S3  and  Amazon
              Redshift.

              IamRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the IAM role that Amazon
                 Pinpoint uses when sending email events to the Amazon Kinesis
                 Data Firehose stream.

              DeliveryStreamArn -> (string)

          CloudWatchDestination -> (structure)
              An object that defines  an  Amazon  CloudWatch  destination  for
              email  events. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor and gain
              insights on your email sending metrics.

              DimensionConfigurations -> (list)
                 An array of objects that define the dimensions  to  use  when
                 you send email events to Amazon CloudWatch.

                 (structure)
                     An object that defines the dimension configuration to use
                     when you send Amazon  Pinpoint  email  events  to  Amazon
                     CloudWatch.

                     DimensionName -> (string)
                        The  name of an Amazon CloudWatch dimension associated
                        with an email sending metric. The name has to meet the
                        following criteria:

                        o It  can  only contain ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), num-

                        a  dimension  to  publish to Amazon CloudWatch. If you
                        want Amazon Pinpoint to use the message tags that  you
                        specify using an X-SES-MESSAGE-TAGS header or a param-
                        eter to the SendEmail/SendRawEmail  API,  choose  mes-
                        sageTag  . If you want Amazon Pinpoint to use your own
                        email headers, choose emailHeader . If you want Amazon
                        Pinpoint to use link tags, choose linkTags .

                     DefaultDimensionValue -> (string)
                        The  default  value of the dimension that is published
                        to Amazon CloudWatch if you don't provide the value of
                        the  dimension  when you send an email. This value has
                        to meet the following criteria:

                        o It can only contain ASCII letters (a-z,  A-Z),  num-

          SnsDestination -> (structure)
              An  object  that  defines  an  Amazon  SNS destination for email

              email events occur.

              TopicArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic that
                 you want to publish email events  to.  For  more  information

              create segments for your campaigns.

              ApplicationArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Pinpoint project

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
