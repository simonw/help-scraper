SYNOPSIS
            update-input-device
          [--hd-device-settings <value>]
          --input-device-id <value>
          [--name <value>]
          [--uhd-device-settings <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --hd-device-settings (structure) The settings that you want to apply to
       the HD input device.ConfiguredInput -> (string)
              The input source that you want to  use.  If  the  device  has  a
              source connected to only one of its input ports, or if you don't
              care which source the device sends, specify Auto. If the  device
              has  sources  connected to both its input ports, and you want to
              use a specific source, specify the source.

          MaxBitrate -> (integer)
              The maximum bitrate in bits per second.  Set  a  value  here  to
              throttle the bitrate of the source video.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ConfiguredInput=string,MaxBitrate=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ConfiguredInput": "AUTO"|"HDMI"|"SDI",
            "MaxBitrate": integer
          }

       --input-device-id (string) The unique ID of the input device. For exam-
       ple, hd-123456789abcdef.

       --name (string) The name that you assigned to this  input  device  (not
       the unique ID).

       --uhd-device-settings  (structure)  The settings that you want to apply
       to the UHD input device.ConfiguredInput -> (string)
              The input source that you want to  use.  If  the  device  has  a
              source connected to only one of its input ports, or if you don't
              care which source the device sends, specify Auto. If the  device
              has  sources  connected to both its input ports, and you want to
              use a specific source, specify the source.

          MaxBitrate -> (integer)
              The maximum bitrate in bits per second.  Set  a  value  here  to
              throttle the bitrate of the source video.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ConfiguredInput=string,MaxBitrate=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ConfiguredInput": "AUTO"|"HDMI"|"SDI",
            "MaxBitrate": integer
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The unique ARN of the input device.

       DeviceSettingsSyncState -> (string)
          The status of the action to synchronize the device configuration. If
          you change the configuration of the input device (for  example,  the
          maximum  bitrate),  MediaLive  sends the new data to the device. The
          device might not update itself immediately. SYNCED means the  device
          has updated its configuration. SYNCING means that it has not updated
          its configuration.
