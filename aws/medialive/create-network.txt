NAME
       create-network -

DESCRIPTION
       Create  as  many  Networks  as you need. You will associate one or more
       Clusters with each Network.Each  Network  provides  MediaLive  Anywhere
       with  required  information about the network in your organization that
       you are using for video encoding using MediaLive.

OPTIONS
       --ip-pools (list) An array of IpPoolCreateRequests that identify a col-
       lection  of  IP  addresses in your network that you want to reserve for
       use in MediaLive Anywhere. MediaLiveAnywhere uses  these  IP  addresses
       for  Push inputs (in both Bridge and NATnetworks) and for output desti-
       nations (only in Bridge  networks).  EachIpPoolUpdateRequest  specifies
       one CIDR block.(structure)
          Used in CreateNetworkRequest.

          Cidr -> (string)
              A CIDR block of IP addresses to reserve for MediaLive Anywhere.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Cidr=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Cidr": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --name  (string)  Specify  a name that is unique in the AWS account. We
       recommend that you assign a name that hints at the type of  traffic  on
       the network. Names are case-sensitive.

       --request-id  (string)  An ID that you assign to a create request. This
       ID ensures idempotency when creating resources.

       --routes (list) An array of routes that  MediaLive  Anywhere  needs  to
       know about in order to route encoding traffic.(structure)
          Used in CreateNetworkRequest.

          Cidr -> (string)
              A CIDR block for one Route.

          Gateway -> (string)
              The IP address of the Gateway for this route, if applicable.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Cidr=string,Gateway=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Cidr": "string",
              "Gateway": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --tags (map) A collection of key-value pairs.key -> (string)
              Placeholder documentation for __string

          value -> (string)
              Placeholder documentation for __string

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

          for Push inputs (in both Bridge and NAT  networks)  and  for  output
          destinations  (only  in  Bridge networks). Each IpPool specifies one
          CIDR block.
