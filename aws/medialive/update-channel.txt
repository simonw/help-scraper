                     for this output group. You do not need to specify the in-
                     dividual inputs in MediaPackage;  MediaLive  will  handle
                     the  connection of the two MediaLive pipelines to the two
                     MediaPackage inputs. The MediaPackage channel  and  Medi-

                     is passed through to the output. If the input contains no
                     ISO 639 audioType, the value in Audio Type is included in
                     the output. useConfigured: The value in Audio Type is in-
                     cluded in the output. Note that this field and  audioType
                     are both ignored if inputType is broadcasterMixedAd.

                            depend  on  rate  control  mode  and  profile. The
                            adReceiverMix setting receives a  stereo  descrip-
                            tion  plus  control track and emits a mono AAC en-
                            code of the description track, with  control  data
                            emitted  in  the PES header as per ETSI TS 101 154

                            pre-mixed  main audio + AD (narration) as a stereo
                            pair. The Audio Type field (audioType) will be set
                            to  3,  which  signals  to downstream systems that
                            this stream contains "broadcaster mixed AD".  Note
                            that  the  input received by the encoder must con-
                            tain pre-mixed audio; the encoder does not perform
                            the mixing. The values in audioTypeControl and au-
                            dioType (in AudioDescription) are ignored when set
                            to  broadcasterMixedAd. Leave set to "normal" when
                            input does not contain pre-mixed audio + AD.

                            Specifies the color of the  rectangle  behind  the
                            captions.  All  burn-in  and DVB-Sub font settings
                            must match.

                        BackgroundOpacity -> (integer)
                            Specifies the opacity of the background rectangle.
                            255  is opaque; 0 is transparent. Leaving this pa-
                            rameter out is  equivalent  to  setting  it  to  0
                            (transparent).  All  burn-in and DVB-Sub font set-
                            tings must match.

                            text sources use a strict grid system.  Using  ex-
                            ternal  fonts  with  these  caption  sources could
                            cause unexpected display  of  proportional  fonts.
                            All burn-in and DVB-Sub font settings must match.

                        FontOpacity -> (integer)
                            Specifies  the  opacity of the burned-in captions.
                            255 is opaque; 0 is transparent. All  burn-in  and
                            DVB-Sub font settings must match.

                        FontResolution -> (integer)
                            Font resolution in DPI (dots per inch); default is

                            bedded or teletext. These source settings are  al-
                            ready  pre-defined  by  the  caption  stream.  All
                            burn-in and DVB-Sub font settings must match.

                        OutlineSize -> (integer)
                            Specifies font outline size in pixels. This option
                            is  not  valid for source captions that are either
                            608/embedded or teletext.  These  source  settings
                            are already pre-defined by the caption stream. All

                        ShadowColor -> (string)
                            Specifies the color of the shadow cast by the cap-
                            tions.  All burn-in and DVB-Sub font settings must
                            match.

                        ShadowOpacity -> (integer)
                            Specifies  the  opacity  of  the  shadow.  255  is
                            opaque;  0  is transparent. Leaving this parameter
                            out is equivalent to setting it  to  0  (transpar-
                            ent).  All  burn-in and DVB-Sub font settings must
                            match.

                        ShadowXOffset -> (integer)
                            Specifies the horizontal offset of the shadow rel-
                            ative  to  the  captions  in pixels. A value of -2
                            would result in a shadow offset 2  pixels  to  the
                            left.  All  burn-in and DVB-Sub font settings must
                            match.

                        ShadowYOffset -> (integer)
                            Specifies the vertical offset of the shadow  rela-
                            tive  to  the  captions  in  pixels. A value of -2
                            would result in a shadow offset 2 pixels above the
                            text.  All  burn-in and DVB-Sub font settings must
                            match.

                        TeletextGridControl -> (string)
                            Controls whether a fixed grid size will be used to
                            generate  the output subtitles bitmap. Only appli-

                        XPosition -> (integer)
                            Specifies  the  horizontal position of the caption
                            relative to the left side of the output in pixels.
                            A  value of 10 would result in the captions start-
                            ing 10 pixels from the left of the output.  If  no
                            explicit  xPosition  is  provided,  the horizontal
                            caption position will be determined by the  align-
                            ment  parameter. All burn-in and DVB-Sub font set-
                            tings must match.

                        YPosition -> (integer)
                            Specifies the vertical  position  of  the  caption
                            relative  to  the  top  of the output in pixels. A
                            value of 10 would result in the captions  starting
                            10  pixels  from  the top of the output. If no ex-
                            plicit yPosition is provided, the caption will  be
                            positioned  towards  the bottom of the output. All
                            burn-in and DVB-Sub font settings must match.

                        Alignment -> (string)
                            If no explicit xPosition or yPosition is provided,
                            setting  alignment to centered will place the cap-
                            tions at the bottom center of  the  output.  Simi-
                            larly,  setting  a  left alignment will align cap-
                            tions to the bottom left of the output. If x and y
                            positions are given in conjunction with the align-
                            ment parameter, the font will be justified (either
                            left  or  centered) relative to those coordinates.
                            Selecting "smart" justification will  left-justify
                            live  subtitles  and  center-justify  pre-recorded
                            subtitles. This option is  not  valid  for  source
                            captions  that  are  STL  or  608/embedded.  These

                            match.

                        TeletextGridControl -> (string)
                            Controls whether a fixed grid size will be used to
                            generate  the output subtitles bitmap. Only appli-
                            cable for Teletext inputs and DVB-Sub/Burn-in out-
                            puts.

                        XPosition -> (integer)
                            Specifies  the  horizontal position of the caption
                            relative to the left side of the output in pixels.
                            A  value of 10 would result in the captions start-
                            ing 10 pixels from the left of the output.  If  no
                            explicit  xPosition  is  provided,  the horizontal
                            caption position will be determined by the  align-
                            ment  parameter.  This  option  is  not  valid for
                            source captions  that  are  STL,  608/embedded  or
                            teletext.   These   source  settings  are  already
                            pre-defined by the caption stream. All burn-in and
                            DVB-Sub font settings must match.

                        YPosition -> (integer)
                            Specifies  the  vertical  position  of the caption
                            relative to the top of the  output  in  pixels.  A
                            value  of 10 would result in the captions starting
                            10 pixels from the top of the output.  If  no  ex-
                            plicit  yPosition is provided, the caption will be
                            positioned towards the bottom of the output.  This
                            option  is  not valid for source captions that are
                            STL, 608/embedded or teletext. These  source  set-
                            tings  are  already  pre-defined  by  the  caption
                            stream. All burn-in and DVB-Sub font settings must
                            match.

                            copied from the input captions. The size is always
                            set  to  100%  to  allow  the downstream player to
                            choose the size. - Enter a list of font  families,
                            as  a comma-separated list of font names, in order

                            serif), or default (to let the  downstream  player
                            choose  the font). - Leave blank to set the family
                            to monospace.

                            that is attached to the  EBU-TT  captions.  -  in-
                            clude:  Take  the  style  information (font color,
                            font position, and so on) from the source captions
                            and  include that information in the font data at-
                            tached to the  EBU-TT  captions.  This  option  is
                            valid  only if the source captions are Embedded or
                            Teletext. - exclude: In the font data attached  to

                            are required in the manifest (according to the HLS
                            specification)  and  serve  an  important purpose.

                            cording  to the Output Selection field). STANDARD:
                            Create an I-frame-only manifest  for  each  output
                            that  contains  video,  as well as the other mani-
                            fests (according to the Output  Selection  field).
                            The      I-frame      manifest      contains     a
                            #EXT-X-I-FRAMES-ONLY tag to indicate it is I-frame
                            only,  and  one  or  more #EXT-X-BYTERANGE entries
                            identifying the  I-frame  position.  For  example,
                            #EXT-X-BYTERANGE:160364@1461888"

                        IncompleteSegmentBehavior -> (string)
                            Specifies  whether  to  include  the final (incom-
                            plete) segment in the media output when the  pipe-
                            line  stops  producing output because of a channel
                            stop, a channel pause or a loss of  input  to  the
                            pipeline.   Auto   means  that  MediaLive  decides
                            whether to include the final segment, depending on
                            the  channel class and the types of output groups.
                            Suppress means to  never  include  the  incomplete
                            segment.  We recommend you choose Auto and let Me-
                            diaLive control the behavior.

                        IndexNSegments -> (integer)
                            Applies only if Mode field is LIVE. Specifies  the
                            maximum  number  of segments in the media manifest
                            file. After this maximum, older segments  are  re-
                            moved from the media manifest. This number must be
                            smaller than  the  number  in  the  Keep  Segments
                            field.

                        InputLossAction -> (string)
                            Parameter  that  control  output group behavior on
                            input loss.

                        IvInManifest -> (string)
                            For use with encryptionType. The  IV  (Initializa-
                            tion  Vector) is a 128-bit number used in conjunc-
                            tion with the key for encrypting blocks. If set to
                            "include", IV is listed in the manifest, otherwise
                            the IV is not in the manifest.

                        IvSource -> (string)
                            For use with encryptionType. The  IV  (Initializa-
                            tion  Vector) is a 128-bit number used in conjunc-
                            tion with the key for encrypting blocks.  If  this
                            setting  is  "followsSegmentNumber", it will cause
                            the IV to change every segment (to match the  seg-
                            ment  number).  If  this is set to "explicit", you
                            must enter a constantIv value.

                        KeepSegments -> (integer)
                            Applies only if Mode field is LIVE. Specifies  the
                            number of media segments to retain in the destina-
                            tion directory. This number should be bigger  than
                            indexNSegments (Num segments). We recommend (value
                            = (2 x indexNsegments) + 1). If  this  "keep  seg-
                            ments" number is too low, the following might hap-
                            pen: the player is still reading a media  manifest
                            file that lists this segment, but that segment has
                            been removed from the  destination  directory  (as
                            directed  by indexNSegments). This situation would
                            result in a 404 HTTP error on the player.

                        KeyFormat -> (string)
                            The value specifies how the key is represented  in
                            the  resource  identified by the URI. If parameter
                            is absent, an  implicit  value  of  "identity"  is
                            used. A reverse DNS string can also be given.

                        KeyFormatVersions -> (string)
                            Either  a single positive integer version value or
                            a slash delimited list of version values (1/2/3).

                        KeyProviderSettings -> (structure)
                            The key provider settings.

                            StaticKeySettings -> (structure)
                               Static Key Settings

                               KeyProviderServer -> (structure)
                                   The URL of the license server used for pro-
                                   tecting content.

                                   PasswordParam -> (string)
                                      key  used  to  extract the password from
                                      EC2 Parameter store

                                   Uri -> (string)
                                      Uniform  Resource  Identifier   -   This
                                      should be a path to a file accessible to
                                      the Live system (eg. a http:// URI)  de-
                                      pending on the output type. For example,
                                      a RTMP destination  should  have  a  uri
                                      simliar to: "rtmp://fmsserver/live".

                                   Username -> (string)
                                      Documentation update needed

                               StaticKeyValue -> (string)
                                   Static key value as a 32 character hexadec-
                                   imal string.

                        ManifestCompression -> (string)
                            When set to gzip, compresses HLS playlist.

                        ManifestDurationFormat -> (string)
                            Indicates whether the output manifest  should  use
                            floating point or integer values for segment dura-
                            tion.

                        MinSegmentLength -> (integer)
                            When  set,  minimumSegmentLength  is  enforced  by
                            looking  ahead and back within the specified range
                            for a nearby avail and extending the segment  size
                            if needed.

                        Mode -> (string)
                            If "vod", all segments are indexed and kept perma-
                            nently in the destination and manifest. If "live",
                            only the number segments specified in keepSegments
                            and indexNSegments are kept;  newer  segments  re-
                            place  older  segments,  which may prevent players
                            from rewinding all the way to the beginning of the
                            event.  VOD  mode  uses HLS EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE of
                            EVENT while the channel is running, converting  it
                            to  a  "VOD"  type  manifest  on completion of the
                            stream.

                        OutputSelection -> (string)
                            MANIFESTS_AND_SEGMENTS: Generates manifests  (mas-
                            ter  manifest, if applicable, and media manifests)
                            for this output group.  VARIANT_MANIFESTS_AND_SEG-
                            MENTS:  Generates  media manifests for this output
                            group, but not a master  manifest.  SEGMENTS_ONLY:
                            Does  not  generate  any manifests for this output
                            group.

                        ProgramDateTime -> (string)
                            Includes or excludes  EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME  tag
                            in  .m3u8  manifest files. The value is calculated
                            using the program date time clock.

                        ProgramDateTimeClock -> (string)
                            Specifies the algorithm  used  to  drive  the  HLS
                            EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME  clock.  Options  include:
                            INITIALIZE_FROM_OUTPUT_TIMECODE: The PDT clock  is
                            initialized  as  a  function  of  the first output
                            timecode, then incremented by the EXTINF  duration
                            of  each  encoded  segment.  SYSTEM_CLOCK: The PDT
                            clock is initialized as a function of the UTC wall
                            clock,  then incremented by the EXTINF duration of
                            each encoded segment. If the  PDT  clock  diverges
                            from  the  wall  clock  by  more than 500ms, it is
                            resynchronized to the wall clock.

                        ProgramDateTimePeriod -> (integer)
                            Period of insertion of EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME en-
                            try, in seconds.

                        RedundantManifest -> (string)
                            ENABLED: The master manifest (.m3u8 file) for each
                            pipeline includes  information  about  both  pipe-
                            lines:  first  its own media files, then the media
                            files of the other pipeline. This  feature  allows
                            playout  device that support stale manifest detec-
                            tion to switch from one  manifest  to  the  other,
                            when the current manifest seems to be stale. There
                            are still two destinations and  two  master  mani-
                            fests, but both master manifests reference the me-
                            dia files from both pipelines. DISABLED: The  mas-
                            ter  manifest  (.m3u8  file) for each pipeline in-
                            cludes information about its  own  pipeline  only.
                            For  an  HLS output group with MediaPackage as the
                            destination, the DISABLED behavior is always  fol-
                            lowed.  MediaPackage  regenerates the manifests it
                            serves to players so a redundant manifest from Me-
                            diaLive is irrelevant.

                        SegmentLength -> (integer)
                            Length of MPEG-2 Transport Stream segments to cre-
                            ate (in seconds). Note that segments will  end  on
                            the next keyframe after this number of seconds, so
                            actual segment length may be longer.

                        SegmentationMode -> (string)
                            useInputSegmentation has been deprecated. The con-
                            figured segment size is always used.

                        SegmentsPerSubdirectory -> (integer)
                            Number  of segments to write to a subdirectory be-
                            fore starting a new one.  directoryStructure  must
                            be  subdirectoryPerStream for this setting to have
                            an effect.

                        StreamInfResolution -> (string)
                            Include or exclude RESOLUTION attribute for  video
                            in EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag of variant manifest.

                        TimedMetadataId3Frame -> (string)
                            Indicates ID3 frame that has the timecode.

                        TimedMetadataId3Period -> (integer)
                            Timed Metadata interval in seconds.

                        TimestampDeltaMilliseconds -> (integer)
                            Provides an extra millisecond delta offset to fine
                            tune the timestamps.

                        TsFileMode -> (string)
                            SEGMENTED_FILES: Emit the program  as  segments  -
                            multiple  .ts  media  files.  SINGLE_FILE: Applies
                            only if Mode field is VOD. Emit the program  as  a
                            single .ts media file. The media manifest includes
                            #EXT-X-BYTERANGE tags to index segments for  play-
                            back. A typical use for this value is when sending
                            the output to AWS  Elemental  MediaConvert,  which
                            can  accept  only  a  single  media file. Playback
                            while the channel is running is not guaranteed due
                            to HTTP server caching.

                     MediaPackageGroupSettings -> (structure)
                        Media Package Group Settings

                        Destination -> (structure)
                            MediaPackage channel destination.

                            DestinationRefId -> (string)
                               Placeholder documentation for __string

                     MsSmoothGroupSettings -> (structure)
                        Ms Smooth Group Settings

                        AcquisitionPointId -> (string)
                            The  ID  to  include in each message in the sparse
                            track. Ignored if sparseTrackType is NONE.

                        AudioOnlyTimecodeControl -> (string)
                            If set to passthrough for an audio-only MS  Smooth
                            output,  the fragment absolute time will be set to
                            the current timecode. This option does  not  write
                            timecodes to the audio elementary stream.

                     RtmpGroupSettings -> (structure)
                        Rtmp Group Settings

                        AdMarkers -> (list)
                            Choose the ad marker type for this  output  group.
                            MediaLive  will create a message based on the con-
                            tent of each SCTE-35 message, format it  for  that
                            marker type, and insert it in the datastream.

                            (string)

                        CacheFullBehavior -> (string)
                            Controls behavior when content cache fills up.  If
                            remote  origin  server  stalls the RTMP connection
                            and does not accept content fast enough the 'Media
                            Cache'  will  fill  up. When the cache reaches the
                            duration specified by cacheLength the  cache  will
                            stop  accepting  new content. If set to disconnec-
                            tImmediately, the RTMP output will force a discon-
                            nect.  Clear  the media cache, and reconnect after
                            restartDelay seconds. If set to waitForServer, the
                            RTMP output will wait up to 5 minutes to allow the
                            origin server to begin accepting data again.

                        CacheLength -> (integer)
                            Cache length, in seconds,  is  used  to  calculate
                            buffer size.

                        CaptionData -> (string)
                            Controls  the  types of data that passes to onCap-
                            tionInfo outputs. If set to 'all' then 608 and 708
                            carried  DTVCC  data  will  be  passed.  If set to
                            'field1AndField2608'  then  DTVCC  data  will   be
                            stripped  out,  but 608 data from both fields will
                            be passed. If set to  'field1608'  then  only  the
                            data  carried  in  608  from field 1 video will be
                            passed.

                        InputLossAction -> (string)
                            Controls the behavior of this RTMP group if  input
                            becomes  unavailable.  -  emitOutput: Emit a slate
                            until input returns. - pauseOutput: Stop transmit-
                            ting data until input returns. This does not close
                            the underlying RTMP connection.

                        RestartDelay -> (integer)
                            If a streaming output fails, number of seconds  to
                            wait  until  a  restart is initiated. A value of 0
                            means never restart.

                     UdpGroupSettings -> (structure)
                        Udp Group Settings

                        InputLossAction -> (string)
                            Specifies behavior of last resort when input video
                            is  lost, and no more backup inputs are available.
                            When  dropTs  is  selected  the  entire  transport
                            stream  will  stop being emitted. When dropProgram
                            is selected the program can be  dropped  from  the
                            transport  stream  (and replaced with null packets
                            to meet the  TS  bitrate  requirement).  Or,  when
                            emitProgram  is  chosen  the transport stream will
                            continue  to  be  produced  normally  with  repeat
                            frames,  black frames, or slate frames substituted
                            for the absent input video.

                                      AbsentInputAudioBehavior -> (string)
                                          When  set  to  drop,  output   audio
                                          streams  will  be  removed  from the
                                          program if the selected input  audio
                                          stream  is  removed  from the input.
                                          This allows the output audio config-
                                          uration  to dynamically change based
                                          on input configuration. If  this  is
                                          set to encodeSilence, all output au-
                                          dio streams will output encoded  si-

                                          Packet  Identifier (PID) of the ele-
                                          mentary  audio  stream(s)   in   the
                                          transport  stream.  Multiple  values
                                          are accepted, and can be entered  in
                                          ranges  and/or  by comma separation.
                                          Can be entered as decimal  or  hexa-
                                          decimal  values.  Each PID specified
                                          must be  in  the  range  of  32  (or
                                          0x20)..8182 (or 0x1ff6).

                                      AudioStreamType -> (string)
                                          When set to atsc, uses stream type =
                                          0x81 for AC3 and stream type =  0x87
                                          for  EAC3.  When  set  to  dvb, uses
                                          stream type = 0x06.

                                      Bitrate -> (integer)

                                          stream  in  bits per second. Setting
                                          to 0 lets  the  muxer  automatically
                                          determine the appropriate bitrate.

                                      BufferModel -> (string)
                                          Controls  the  timing  accuracy  for

                                          MULTIPLEX to ensure accurate network
                                          packet timing. Or set to NONE, which
                                          might  result  in  lower latency but
                                          will result in more  variability  in
                                          output  network  packet timing. This
                                          variability  might  cause  interrup-
                                          tions, jitter, or bursty behavior in
                                          your playback or receiving devices.

                                          transport  stream.  When no value is
                                          given, the encoder will  assign  the
                                          same  value as the Video PID. Can be
                                          entered as a decimal or  hexadecimal
                                          value.   Valid  values  are  32  (or

                                      SegmentationStyle -> (string)
                                          The   segmentation  style  parameter
                                          controls  how  segmentation  markers
                                          are   inserted  into  the  transport
                                          stream. With avails, it is  possible
                                          that   segments  may  be  truncated,
                                          which  can  influence  where  future
                                          segmentation  markers  are inserted.
                                          When a segmentation style of "reset-
                                          Cadence"  is  selected and a segment
                                          is truncated due  to  an  avail,  we
                                          will reset the segmentation cadence.
                                          This means  the  subsequent  segment
                                          will  have  a duration of $segmenta-
                                          tionTime seconds. When  a  segmenta-
                                          tion  style  of "maintainCadence" is
                                          selected and a segment is  truncated
                                          due  to  an avail, we will not reset
                                          the segmentation cadence. This means
                                          the  subsequent  segment will likely
                                          be truncated as well.  However,  all
                                          segments  after that will have a du-
                                          ration of $segmentationTime seconds.
                                          Note  that EBP lookahead is a slight
                                          exception to this rule.

                                      SegmentationTime -> (double)

                                          transport stream. When no  value  is
                                          given,  the  encoder will assign the
                                          same value as the Video PID. Can  be
                                          entered  as a decimal or hexadecimal
                                          value.  Valid  values  are  32   (or

                                      SegmentationStyle -> (string)
                                          The  segmentation  style   parameter
                                          controls  how  segmentation  markers
                                          are  inserted  into  the   transport
                                          stream.  With avails, it is possible
                                          that  segments  may  be   truncated,
                                          which  can  influence  where  future
                                          segmentation markers  are  inserted.
                                          When a segmentation style of "reset-
                                          Cadence" is selected and  a  segment
                                          is  truncated  due  to  an avail, we
                                          will reset the segmentation cadence.
                                          This  means  the  subsequent segment
                                          will have a duration  of  $segmenta-
                                          tionTime  seconds.  When a segmenta-
                                          tion style of  "maintainCadence"  is
                                          selected  and a segment is truncated
                                          due to an avail, we will  not  reset
                                          the segmentation cadence. This means
                                          the subsequent segment  will  likely
                                          be  truncated  as well. However, all
                                          segments after that will have a  du-
                                          ration of $segmentationTime seconds.
                                          Note that EBP lookahead is a  slight
                                          exception to this rule.

                                   Error Correction on UDP outputs.

                                   ColumnDepth -> (integer)
                                      Parameter   D  from  SMPTE  2022-1.  The
                                      height of the FEC protection matrix. The
                                      number  of  transport stream packets per
                                      column error correction packet. Must  be
                                      between 4 and 20, inclusive.

                                   IncludeFec -> (string)
                                      Enables  column  only  or column and row

                                      between 1 and  20,  inclusive.  If  only
                                      Column  FEC  is used, then larger values
                                      increase robustness. If Row FEC is used,
                                      then  this  is  the  number of transport
                                      stream packets per row error  correction
                                      packet,  and the value must be between 4
                                      and  20,  inclusive,  if  includeFec  is
                                      columnAndRow.  If  includeFec is column,
                                      this value must be 1 to 20, inclusive.

                 Identifies the source for the timecode that will  be  associ-
                 ated  with the events outputs. -Embedded (embedded): Initial-
                 ize the output timecode with timecode from the the source. If
                 no  embedded  timecode  is detected in the source, the system
                 falls back to using "Start at 0" (zerobased).  -System  Clock
                 (systemclock): Use the UTC time. -Start at 0 (zerobased): The
                 time of the first frame of the event will be 00:00:00:00.

              SyncThreshold -> (integer)
                 Threshold in frames beyond which output  timecode  is  resyn-
                 chronized  to  the  input  timecode. Discrepancies below this
                 threshold are permitted to avoid unnecessary  discontinuities
                 in  the  output  timecode.  No timecode sync when this is not
                 specified.

                            clusion  in the output. May be specified in either
                            seconds or  milliseconds,  as  specified  by  cap-
                            tureIntervalUnits.

                        AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Enables  or  disables adaptive quantization, which
                            is a technique MediaLive can apply to video  on  a
                            frame-by-frame  basis  to produce more compression
                            without losing quality. There are three  types  of
                            adaptive  quantization: flicker, spatial, and tem-
                            poral. Set the field in one of these ways: Set  to
                            Auto.  Recommended. For each type of AQ, MediaLive
                            will determine if AQ is needed, and if so, the ap-
                            propriate  strength. Set a strength (a value other
                            than Auto or Disable). This strength will apply to
                            any  of  the  AQ fields that you choose to enable.
                            Set to Disabled to disable all types  of  adaptive
                            quantization.

                        AfdSignaling -> (string)
                            Indicates that AFD values will be written into the
                            output stream. If afdSignaling is "auto", the sys-
                            tem  will  try to preserve the input AFD value (in
                            cases where multiple AFD values are valid). If set
                            to  "fixed",  the AFD value will be the value con-
                            figured in the fixedAfd parameter.

                        Bitrate -> (integer)
                            Average bitrate in bits/second. Required when  the
                            rate  control  mode  is  VBR  or CBR. Not used for
                            QVBR. In an MS Smooth output  group,  each  output
                            must  have  a  unique  value  when  its bitrate is
                            rounded down to the nearest multiple of 1000.

                        BufFillPct -> (integer)

                            filled (HRD buffer model).

                        BufSize -> (integer)
                            Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in bits.

                        ColorMetadata -> (string)

                               Passthrough  applies  no color space conversion
                               to the output

                            Rec601Settings -> (structure)

                        EntropyEncoding -> (string)
                            Entropy encoding mode. Use cabac (must be in  Main
                            or High profile) or cavlc.

                        FilterSettings -> (structure)
                            Optional filters that you can apply to an encode.

                            TemporalFilterSettings -> (structure)
                               Temporal Filter Settings

                               PostFilterSharpening -> (string)
                                   If  you enable this filter, the results are
                                   the following: - If the source  content  is
                                   noisy  (it contains excessive digital arti-
                                   facts), the filter cleans up the source.  -
                                   If the source content is already clean, the
                                   filter tends to decrease the bitrate, espe-
                                   cially when the rate control mode is QVBR.

                               Strength -> (string)
                                   Choose  a  filter  strength. We recommend a
                                   strength of 1 or 2. A higher strength might
                                   take  out good information, resulting in an
                                   image that is overly soft.

                        FixedAfd -> (string)
                            Four bit AFD value to write on all frames of video
                            in the output stream. Only valid when afdSignaling
                            is set to 'Fixed'.

                        FlickerAq -> (string)
                            Flicker AQ makes adjustments within each frame  to
                            reduce  flicker or 'pop' on I-frames. The value to
                            enter in this field depends on the  value  in  the
                            Adaptive  quantization  field: If you have set the
                            Adaptive quantization field to Auto, MediaLive ig-
                            nores  any value in this field. MediaLive will de-
                            termine if flicker AQ is appropriate and will  ap-
                            ply  the appropriate strength. If you have set the
                            Adaptive quantization field to a strength, you can
                            set  this  field  to Enabled or Disabled. Enabled:
                            MediaLive will apply flicker AQ using  the  speci-
                            fied  strength.  Disabled:  MediaLive  won't apply
                            flicker AQ. If you have set the Adaptive quantiza-
                            tion  to  Disabled, MediaLive ignores any value in
                            this field and doesn't apply flicker AQ.

                        ForceFieldPictures -> (string)
                            This setting applies only when scan type  is  "in-
                            terlaced." It controls whether coding is performed
                            on a field basis or on a frame  basis.  (When  the
                            video  is  progressive,  the coding is always per-
                            formed on a frame basis.) enabled: Force MediaLive
                            to  code  on  a  field basis, so that odd and even
                            sets of fields  are  coded  separately.  disabled:
                            Code the two sets of fields separately (on a field
                            basis) or together (on a frame basis using  PAFF),
                            depending on what is most appropriate for the con-
                            tent.

                        FramerateControl -> (string)
                            This field indicates how the  output  video  frame
                            rate is specified. If "specified" is selected then
                            the output video frame rate is determined by fram-
                            erateNumerator  and  framerateDenominator, else if
                            "initializeFromSource" is selected then the output
                            video  frame  rate  will be set equal to the input
                            video frame rate of the first input.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            Framerate denominator.

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            Framerate numerator -  framerate  is  a  fraction,
                            e.g. 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps.

                        GopBReference -> (string)
                            Documentation update needed

                        GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                            Frequency  of  closed  GOPs. In streaming applica-
                            tions, it is recommended that this be set to 1  so
                            a  decoder  joining mid-stream will receive an IDR
                            frame as quickly as possible. Setting  this  value
                            to 0 will break output segmenting.

                        GopNumBFrames -> (integer)
                            Number of B-frames between reference frames.

                        GopSize -> (double)
                            GOP  size  (keyframe  interval) in units of either
                            frames or seconds per gopSizeUnits.  If  gopSizeU-
                            nits  is  frames,  gopSize  must be an integer and
                            must be greater than or equal to 1.  If  gopSizeU-
                            nits  is  seconds, gopSize must be greater than 0,
                            but need not be an integer.

                        GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                            Indicates if the gopSize is specified in frames or
                            seconds.  If  seconds  the system will convert the
                            gopSize into a frame count at run time.

                        Level -> (string)
                            H.264 Level.

                        LookAheadRateControl -> (string)
                            Amount of lookahead. A value of low  can  decrease
                            latency  and  memory usage, while high can produce
                            better quality for certain content.

                        MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                            For QVBR: See the tooltip for  Quality  level  For
                            VBR:  Set the maximum bitrate in order to accommo-
                            date expected spikes  in  the  complexity  of  the
                            video.

                        MinIInterval -> (integer)
                            Only meaningful if sceneChangeDetect is set to en-
                            abled. Defaults to 5 if multiplex rate control  is
                            used.  Enforces  separation  between repeated (ca-
                            dence) I-frames and  I-frames  inserted  by  Scene
                            Change  Detection.  If  a  scene change I-frame is
                            within I-interval frames of a cadence I-frame, the
                            GOP is shrunk and/or stretched to the scene change
                            I-frame. GOP stretch requires  enabling  lookahead
                            as  well as setting I-interval. The normal cadence
                            resumes  for  the  next  GOP.  Note:  Maximum  GOP
                            stretch = GOP size + Min-I-interval - 1

                        NumRefFrames -> (integer)
                            Number of reference frames to use. The encoder may
                            use more than requested if using  B-frames  and/or
                            interlaced encoding.

                        ParControl -> (string)
                            This  field  indicates how the output pixel aspect
                            ratio is specified.  If  "specified"  is  selected
                            then the output video pixel aspect ratio is deter-
                            mined by parNumerator and parDenominator, else  if
                            "initializeFromSource" is selected then the output
                            pixsel aspect ratio will be set equal to the input
                            video pixel aspect ratio of the first input.

                        ParDenominator -> (integer)
                            Pixel Aspect Ratio denominator.

                        ParNumerator -> (integer)
                            Pixel Aspect Ratio numerator.

                        Profile -> (string)
                            H.264 Profile.

                        QualityLevel -> (string)
                            Leave  as  STANDARD_QUALITY  or choose a different
                            value (which might result in additional  costs  to
                            run  the  channel). - ENHANCED_QUALITY: Produces a
                            slightly better video quality without an  increase
                            in  the  bitrate. Has an effect only when the Rate
                            control mode is QVBR or CBR. If this channel is in
                            a  MediaLive  multiplex,  the  value  must  be EN-
                            HANCED_QUALITY. - STANDARD_QUALITY: Valid for  any
                            Rate control mode.

                        QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                            Controls  the target quality for the video encode.
                            Applies only when the rate control mode  is  QVBR.
                            You  can set a target quality or you can let Medi-
                            aLive determine the best quality. To set a  target
                            quality,  enter  values  in the QVBR quality level
                            field and the Max bitrate field. Enter values that
                            suit  your  most important viewing devices. Recom-
                            mended  values  are:  -  Primary  screen:  Quality
                            level:  8  to  10. Max bitrate: 4M - PC or tablet:
                            Quality level: 7. Max bitrate: 1.5M to 3M - Smart-
                            phone:  Quality  level: 6. Max bitrate: 1M to 1.5M
                            To let MediaLive decide, leave  the  QVBR  quality
                            level  field  empty,  and in Max bitrate enter the
                            maximum rate you want in the video. For  more  in-
                            formation,  see  the  section called "Video - rate
                            control mode" in the MediaLive user guide

                        RateControlMode -> (string)
                            Rate control mode. QVBR: Quality  will  match  the
                            specified  quality  level  except  when it is con-
                            strained by the maximum  bitrate.  Recommended  if
                            you  or your viewers pay for bandwidth. VBR: Qual-
                            ity and bitrate vary, depending on the video  com-
                            plexity.  Recommended  instead of QVBR if you want
                            to maintain a specific average  bitrate  over  the
                            duration  of the channel. CBR: Quality varies, de-
                            pending on the video complexity. Recommended  only
                            if you distribute your assets to devices that can-
                            not handle variable bitrates. Multiplex: This rate
                            control  mode  is only supported (and is required)
                            when the video is being delivered to  a  MediaLive
                            Multiplex  in which case the rate control configu-
                            ration is controlled by the properties within  the
                            Multiplex Program.

                        ScanType -> (string)
                            Sets the scan type of the output to progressive or
                            top-field-first interlaced.

                        SceneChangeDetect -> (string)
                            Scene change detection.  -  On:  inserts  I-frames
                            when  scene  change  is  detected. - Off: does not
                            force an I-frame when scene change is detected.

                        Slices -> (integer)
                            Number of slices per picture. Must be less than or
                            equal  to  the  number of macroblock rows for pro-
                            gressive pictures, and less than or equal to  half
                            the  number of macroblock rows for interlaced pic-
                            tures. This field is optional; when  no  value  is
                            specified  the  encoder  will choose the number of
                            slices based on encode resolution.

                        Softness -> (integer)
                            Softness. Selects quantizer matrix, larger  values
                            reduce  high-frequency  content in the encoded im-
                            age. If not set to zero, must be greater than 15.

                        SpatialAq -> (string)
                            Spatial AQ makes  adjustments  within  each  frame
                            based  on spatial variation of content complexity.
                            The value to enter in this field  depends  on  the
                            value  in  the Adaptive quantization field: If you
                            have set the Adaptive quantization field to  Auto,
                            MediaLive  ignores  any value in this field. Medi-
                            aLive will determine if spatial AQ is  appropriate
                            and  will  apply  the appropriate strength. If you
                            have set the  Adaptive  quantization  field  to  a
                            strength,  you  can  set  this field to Enabled or
                            Disabled. Enabled: MediaLive will apply spatial AQ
                            using  the specified strength. Disabled: MediaLive
                            won't apply spatial AQ. If you have set the  Adap-
                            tive  quantization  to Disabled, MediaLive ignores
                            any value in this field and doesn't apply  spatial
                            AQ.

                        SubgopLength -> (string)
                            If  set  to  fixed, use gopNumBFrames B-frames per
                            sub-GOP. If set to dynamic, optimize the number of
                            B-frames  used  for each sub-GOP to improve visual
                            quality.

                        Syntax -> (string)
                            Produces a bitstream compliant with SMPTE RP-2027.

                        TemporalAq -> (string)
                            Temporal makes adjustments within each frame based
                            on  temporal  variation of content complexity. The
                            value to enter in this field depends on the  value
                            in  the  Adaptive  quantization field: If you have
                            set the Adaptive quantization field to Auto, Medi-
                            aLive  ignores  any value in this field. MediaLive
                            will determine if temporal AQ is  appropriate  and
                            will  apply  the appropriate strength. If you have
                            set the Adaptive quantization field to a strength,
                            you can set this field to Enabled or Disabled. En-
                            abled: MediaLive will apply temporal AQ using  the
                            specified  strength. Disabled: MediaLive won't ap-
                            ply temporal AQ. If  you  have  set  the  Adaptive
                            quantization  to  Disabled,  MediaLive ignores any
                            value in this field and doesn't apply temporal AQ.

                        TimecodeInsertion -> (string)
                            Determines how timecodes should be  inserted  into
                            the  video elementary stream. - 'disabled': Do not
                            include timecodes - 'picTimingSei':  Pass  through
                            picture timing SEI messages from the source speci-
                            fied in Timecode Config

                        AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Adaptive quantization. Allows intra-frame quantiz-
                            ers to vary to improve visual quality.

                        AfdSignaling -> (string)
                            Indicates that AFD values will be written into the
                            output stream. If afdSignaling is "auto", the sys-
                            tem  will  try to preserve the input AFD value (in
                            cases where multiple AFD values are valid). If set
                            to  "fixed",  the AFD value will be the value con-
                            figured in the fixedAfd parameter.

                        AlternativeTransferFunction -> (string)
                            Whether or not EML should  insert  an  Alternative
                            Transfer Function SEI message to support backwards
                            compatibility with non-HDR decoders and displays.

                        Bitrate -> (integer)
                            Average bitrate in bits/second. Required when  the
                            rate  control  mode  is  VBR  or CBR. Not used for
                            QVBR. In an MS Smooth output  group,  each  output
                            must  have  a  unique  value  when  its bitrate is
                            rounded down to the nearest multiple of 1000.

                        BufSize -> (integer)

                            ColorSpacePassthroughSettings -> (structure)
                               Passthrough applies no color  space  conversion
                               to the output

                            Hdr10Settings -> (structure)

                               MaxCll -> (integer)
                                   Maximum  Content  Light  Level  An  integer
                                   metadata value defining the  maximum  light
                                   level,  in nits, of any single pixel within
                                   an encoded HDR video stream or file.

                                   ger metadata value defining the maximum av-
                                   erage light level, in nits, for any  single
                                   frame within an encoded HDR video stream or
                                   file.

                               PostFilterSharpening -> (string)
                                   If you enable this filter, the results  are
                                   the  following:  - If the source content is
                                   noisy (it contains excessive digital  arti-
                                   facts),  the filter cleans up the source. -
                                   If the source content is already clean, the
                                   filter tends to decrease the bitrate, espe-
                                   cially when the rate control mode is QVBR.

                               Strength -> (string)
                                   Choose a filter strength.  We  recommend  a
                                   strength of 1 or 2. A higher strength might
                                   take out good information, resulting in  an
                                   image that is overly soft.

                        FixedAfd -> (string)

                            in the output stream. Only valid when afdSignaling
                            is set to 'Fixed'.

                        FlickerAq -> (string)
                            If set to enabled, adjust quantization within each
                            frame to reduce flicker or 'pop' on I-frames.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            Framerate denominator.

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            Framerate numerator -  framerate  is  a  fraction,
                            e.g. 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps.

                        GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                            Frequency  of  closed  GOPs. In streaming applica-
                            tions, it is recommended that this be set to 1  so
                            a  decoder  joining mid-stream will receive an IDR
                            frame as quickly as possible. Setting  this  value
                            to 0 will break output segmenting.

                        GopSize -> (double)
                            GOP  size  (keyframe  interval) in units of either
                            frames or seconds per gopSizeUnits.  If  gopSizeU-
                            nits  is  frames,  gopSize  must be an integer and
                            must be greater than or equal to 1.  If  gopSizeU-
                            nits  is  seconds, gopSize must be greater than 0,
                            but need not be an integer.

                        GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                            Indicates if the gopSize is specified in frames or
                            seconds.  If  seconds  the system will convert the
                            gopSize into a frame count at run time.

                        Level -> (string)
                            H.265 Level.

                        LookAheadRateControl -> (string)
                            Amount of lookahead. A value of low  can  decrease
                            latency  and  memory usage, while high can produce
                            better quality for certain content.

                        MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                            For QVBR: See the tooltip for Quality level

                        MinIInterval -> (integer)
                            Only meaningful if sceneChangeDetect is set to en-
                            abled.  Defaults to 5 if multiplex rate control is
                            used. Enforces separation  between  repeated  (ca-
                            dence)  I-frames  and  I-frames  inserted by Scene
                            Change Detection. If a  scene  change  I-frame  is
                            within I-interval frames of a cadence I-frame, the
                            GOP is shrunk and/or stretched to the scene change
                            I-frame.  GOP  stretch requires enabling lookahead
                            as well as setting I-interval. The normal  cadence
                            resumes  for  the  next  GOP.  Note:  Maximum  GOP
                            stretch = GOP size + Min-I-interval - 1

                        ParDenominator -> (integer)
                            Pixel Aspect Ratio denominator.

                        ParNumerator -> (integer)
                            Pixel Aspect Ratio numerator.

                        Profile -> (string)
                            H.265 Profile.

                        QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                            Controls the target quality for the video  encode.
                            Applies  only  when the rate control mode is QVBR.
                            Set values for the QVBR quality  level  field  and
                            Max  bitrate  field  that suit your most important
                            viewing devices. Recommended values are: - Primary
                            screen:  Quality level: 8 to 10. Max bitrate: 4M -

                            1M to 1.5M

                        RateControlMode -> (string)
                            Rate control mode. QVBR: Quality  will  match  the
                            specified  quality  level  except  when it is con-
                            strained by the maximum  bitrate.  Recommended  if
                            you  or your viewers pay for bandwidth. CBR: Qual-
                            ity varies, depending  on  the  video  complexity.
                            Recommended  only if you distribute your assets to
                            devices that cannot handle variable bitrates. Mul-
                            tiplex:  This  rate control mode is only supported
                            (and is required) when the video is  being  deliv-
                            ered  to  a  MediaLive Multiplex in which case the
                            rate control configuration is  controlled  by  the
                            properties within the Multiplex Program.

                        ScanType -> (string)
                            Sets the scan type of the output to progressive or
                            top-field-first interlaced.

                        SceneChangeDetect -> (string)
                            Scene change detection.

                        Slices -> (integer)
                            Number of slices per picture. Must be less than or
                            equal  to  the  number of macroblock rows for pro-
                            gressive pictures, and less than or equal to  half
                            the  number of macroblock rows for interlaced pic-
                            tures. This field is optional; when  no  value  is
                            specified  the  encoder  will choose the number of
                            slices based on encode resolution.

                        Tier -> (string)
                            H.265 Tier.

                        TimecodeInsertion -> (string)
                            Determines how timecodes should be  inserted  into
                            the  video elementary stream. - 'disabled': Do not
                            include timecodes - 'picTimingSei':  Pass  through
                            picture timing SEI messages from the source speci-

                        Mpeg2 Settings

                        AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Choose Off to disable  adaptive  quantization.  Or
                            choose  another  value to enable the quantizer and
                            set its strength. The strengths  are:  Auto,  Off,
                            Low, Medium, High. When you enable this field, Me-
                            diaLive allows  intra-frame  quantizers  to  vary,
                            which might improve visual quality.

                        AfdSignaling -> (string)
                            Indicates the AFD values that MediaLive will write
                            into the video encode. If you do not know what AFD
                            signaling is, or if your downstream system has not
                            given you guidance, choose AUTO.  AUTO:  MediaLive
                            will try to preserve the input AFD value (in cases
                            where multiple AFD values are valid). FIXED: Medi-
                            aLive will use the value you specify in fixedAFD.

                        ColorMetadata -> (string)
                            Specifies whether to include the color space meta-
                            data. The metadata describes the color space  that
                            applies  to  the  video (the colorSpace field). We
                            recommend that you insert the metadata.

                        ColorSpace -> (string)
                            Choose the type of color space conversion to apply
                            to the output. For detailed information on setting
                            up both the input and the output to obtain the de-
                            sired  color  space in the output, see the section
                            on "MediaLive Features - Video - color  space"  in
                            the  MediaLive  User  Guide. PASSTHROUGH: Keep the
                            color space of the input content - do not  convert
                            it.  AUTO:Convert  all  content  that is SD to rec

                        DisplayAspectRatio -> (string)
                            Sets the pixel aspect ratio for the encode.

                        FilterSettings -> (structure)
                            Optionally specify a noise reduction filter, which
                            can improve quality of compressed content. If  you
                            do not choose a filter, no filter will be applied.
                            TEMPORAL: This filter is useful  for  both  source
                            content that is noisy (when it has excessive digi-
                            tal artifacts) and source content that  is  clean.
                            When  the  content  is noisy, the filter cleans up
                            the source content before the encoding phase, with
                            these  two  effects: First, it improves the output
                            video quality because the content has been cleaned
                            up.  Secondly,  it decreases the bandwidth because
                            MediaLive does not waste bits on  encoding  noise.
                            When  the  content is reasonably clean, the filter
                            tends to decrease the bitrate.

                               PostFilterSharpening -> (string)
                                   If you enable this filter, the results  are
                                   the  following:  - If the source content is
                                   noisy (it contains excessive digital  arti-
                                   facts),  the filter cleans up the source. -
                                   If the source content is already clean, the
                                   filter tends to decrease the bitrate, espe-
                                   cially when the rate control mode is QVBR.

                               Strength -> (string)
                                   Choose a filter strength.  We  recommend  a
                                   strength of 1 or 2. A higher strength might
                                   take out good information, resulting in  an
                                   image that is overly soft.

                        FixedAfd -> (string)
                            Complete  this field only when afdSignaling is set
                            to FIXED. Enter the AFD value (4 bits) to write on
                            all frames of the video encode.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            description":  "The framerate denominator. For ex-
                            ample, 1001. The framerate is  the  numerator  di-
                            vided  by  the  denominator.  For example, 24000 /

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            The framerate numerator. For example,  24000.  The
                            framerate  is the numerator divided by the denomi-
                            nator. For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 FPS.

                        GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                            MPEG2: default is open GOP.

                        GopNumBFrames -> (integer)
                            Relates  to  the  GOP  structure.  The  number  of
                            B-frames  between  reference frames. If you do not
                            know what a B-frame is, use the default.

                        GopSize -> (double)
                            Relates  to  the  GOP  structure.  The  GOP   size
                            (keyframe interval) in the units specified in gop-
                            SizeUnits. If you do not know what GOP is, use the
                            default.  If gopSizeUnits is frames, then the gop-
                            Size must be an integer and must be  greater  than
                            or  equal  to  1.  If gopSizeUnits is seconds, the
                            gopSize must be greater than 0, but does not  need
                            to be an integer.

                        GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                            Relates  to  the  GOP structure. Specifies whether
                            the gopSize is specified in frames or seconds.  If
                            you  do  not  plan  to change the default gopSize,
                            leave the default. If you specify  SECONDS,  Medi-
                            aLive  will  internally  convert the gop size to a
                            frame count.

                        ScanType -> (string)
                            Set the scan type of the output to PROGRESSIVE  or

                            Relates  to  the GOP structure. If you do not know
                            what GOP is, use the default. FIXED: Set the  num-

                            number  of  B-frames  in  each sub-GOP, to improve
                            visual quality.

                        TimecodeInsertion -> (string)
                            Determines how MediaLive inserts timecodes in  the
                            output  video. For detailed information about set-
                            ting up the input and the output for  a  timecode,
                            see  the section on "MediaLive Features - Timecode
                            configuration" in the MediaLive User  Guide.  DIS-
                            ABLED: do not include timecodes. GOP_TIMECODE: In-
                            clude timecode metadata in the GOP header.

                 Height -> (integer)
                     Output video height, in pixels. Must be an  even  number.
                     For most codecs, you can leave this field and width blank
                     in order to use the height and  width  (resolution)  from
                     the source. Note, however, that leaving blank is not rec-
                     ommended. For the Frame Capture codec, height  and  width
                     are required.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The  name of this VideoDescription. Outputs will use this
                     name to uniquely identify this  Description.  Description
                     names should be unique within this Live Event.

                 RespondToAfd -> (string)
                     Indicates  how  MediaLive  will respond to the AFD values
                     that might be in the input video. If you do not know what
                     AFD  signaling  is,  or if your downstream system has not
                     given you guidance, choose  PASSTHROUGH.  RESPOND:  Medi-
                     aLive clips the input video using a formula that uses the
                     AFD values (configured in afdSignaling ), the input  dis-
                     play  aspect  ratio, and the output display aspect ratio.
                     MediaLive also includes the AFD values in the output, un-
                     less   the   codec  for  this  encode  is  FRAME_CAPTURE.
                     PASSTHROUGH: MediaLive ignores the AFD  values  and  does
                     not clip the video. But MediaLive does include the values
                     in the output. NONE: MediaLive does not  clip  the  input
                     video and does not include the AFD values in the output

                 ScalingBehavior -> (string)
                     STRETCH_TO_OUTPUT   configures  the  output  position  to
                     stretch the video  to  the  specified  output  resolution
                     (height  and  width). This option will override any posi-
                     tion value. DEFAULT may insert black boxes (pillar  boxes
                     or  letter  boxes) around the video to provide the speci-
                     fied output resolution.

                 Sharpness -> (integer)
                     Changes the strength of the anti-alias  filter  used  for
                     scaling. 0 is the softest setting, 100 is the sharpest. A
                     setting of 50 is recommended for most content.

                 Width -> (integer)
                     Output video width, in pixels. Must be  an  even  number.
                     For  most  codecs,  you  can  leave this field and height
                     blank in order to use the height and  width  (resolution)
                     from the source. Note, however, that leaving blank is not
                     recommended. For the  Frame  Capture  codec,  height  and
                     width are required.

          AutomaticInputFailoverSettings -> (structure)
              User-specified settings for defining what the conditions are for
              declaring  the  input  unhealthy and failing over to a different
              input.

              ErrorClearTimeMsec -> (integer)
                 This clear time defines the  requirement  a  recovered  input
                 must  meet  to  be considered healthy. The input must have no
                 failover conditions for this length of time. Enter a time  in
                 milliseconds. This value is particularly important if the in-
                 put_preference for the failover pair is  set  to  PRIMARY_IN-
                 PUT_PREFERRED, because after this time, MediaLive will switch
                 back to the primary input.

              FailoverConditions -> (list)
                 A list of failover conditions. If any of these conditions oc-
                 cur, MediaLive will perform a failover to the other input.

                 (structure)
                     Failover   Condition  settings.  There  can  be  multiple
                     failover  conditions  inside   AutomaticInputFailoverSet-
                     tings.

                     FailoverConditionSettings -> (structure)
                        Failover condition type-specific settings.

                        AudioSilenceSettings -> (structure)
                            MediaLive will perform a failover if the specified
                            audio selector is silent for the specified period.

                            AudioSelectorName -> (string)
                               The name of the audio  selector  in  the  input
                               that  MediaLive  should  monitor  to detect si-
                               lence. Select your most important rendition. If
                               you didn't create an audio selector in this in-
                               put, leave blank.

                            AudioSilenceThresholdMsec -> (integer)
                               The amount of time (in milliseconds)  that  the
                               active  input  must  be silent before automatic
                               input failover occurs. Silence  is  defined  as
                               audio loss or audio quieter than -50 dBFS.

                        InputLossSettings -> (structure)
                            MediaLive  will  perform  a failover if content is
                            not detected in this input for the  specified  pe-
                            riod.

                            InputLossThresholdMsec -> (integer)
                               The  amount  of  time (in milliseconds) that no
                               input is detected. After that  time,  an  input
                               failover will occur.

                        VideoBlackSettings -> (structure)
                            MediaLive  will  perform  a failover if content is
                            considered black for the specified period.

                            BlackDetectThreshold -> (double)
                               A value used in calculating the threshold below
                               which   MediaLive   considers  a  pixel  to  be
                               'black'. For the input to be considered  black,
                               every  pixel  in  a  frame  must  be below this
                               threshold. The threshold  is  calculated  as  a
                               percentage  (expressed  as a decimal) of white.
                               Therefore .1 means 10% white  (or  90%  black).
                               Note how the formula works for any color depth.
                               For example, if you set this field  to  0.1  in
                               10-bit  color  depth:  (1023*0.1=102.3),  which
                               means a pixel value of 102 or less is  'black'.
                               If  you  set this field to .1 in an 8-bit color
                               depth:  (255*0.1=25.5),  which  means  a  pixel
                               value  of  25  or less is 'black'. The range is
                               0.0 to 1.0, with any number of decimal places.

                            VideoBlackThresholdMsec -> (integer)
                               The amount of time (in milliseconds)  that  the
                               active input must be black before automatic in-
                               put failover occurs.

              InputPreference -> (string)
                 Input preference when deciding which  input  to  make  active
                 when a previously failed input has recovered.

              SecondaryInputId -> (string)
                 The  input  ID  of the secondary input in the automatic input
                 failover pair.

          InputAttachmentName -> (string)
              User-specified name for the attachment. This is required if  the
              user wants to use this input in an input switch action.

          InputId -> (string)
              The ID of the input

          InputSettings -> (structure)
              Settings of an input (caption selector, etc.)

              AudioSelectors -> (list)
                 Used  to  select  the  audio stream to decode for inputs that
                 have multiple available.

                 (structure)
                     Audio Selector

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of this AudioSelector. AudioDescriptions will
                        use  this name to uniquely identify this Selector. Se-
                        lector names should be unique per input.

                     SelectorSettings -> (structure)
                        The audio selector settings.

                        AudioHlsRenditionSelection -> (structure)

                               of the target HLS audio rendition.

                            Name -> (string)
                               Specifies  the  NAME in the #EXT-X-MEDIA tag of
                               the target HLS audio rendition.

                        AudioLanguageSelection -> (structure)

                               from within an audio source.

                            LanguageSelectionPolicy -> (string)
                               When  set to "strict", the transport stream de-
                               mux strictly identifies audio streams by  their
                               language  descriptor.  If  a  PMT update occurs
                               such that an audio  stream  matching  the  ini-
                               tially  selected  language is no longer present
                               then mute will be encoded  until  the  language
                               returns.  If  "loose", then on a PMT update the
                               demux will choose another audio stream  in  the
                               program  with  the same stream type if it can't
                               find one with the same language.

                               The pid field is used in conjunction  with  the
                               caption selector languageCode field as follows:
                               - Specify PID and Language:  Extracts  captions
                               from that PID; the language is "informational".
                               - Specify PID and omit Language:  Extracts  the
                               specified PID. - Omit PID and specify Language:
                               Extracts the specified language, whichever  PID
                               that  happens  to  be. - Omit PID and omit Lan-

                            OutputRectangle -> (structure)
                               Optionally defines a region  where  TTML  style
                               captions will be displayed

                               Height -> (double)
                                   See  the  description  in  leftOffset.  For
                                   height, specify the entire  height  of  the
                                   rectangle as a percentage of the underlying
                                   frame height. For example, "80"  means  the
                                   rectangle  height  is 80% of the underlying
                                   frame height. The topOffset and  rectangle-
                                   Height  must  add  up to 100% or less. This
                                   field corresponds to tts:extent - Y in  the
                                   TTML standard.

                               LeftOffset -> (double)
                                   Applies  only  if you plan to convert these
                                   source captions to EBU-TT-D or TTML  in  an
                                   output.  (Make sure to leave the default if
                                   you don't have either of these  formats  in
                                   the  output.) You can define a display rec-
                                   tangle for the  captions  that  is  smaller
                                   than the underlying video frame. You define
                                   the rectangle by specifying the position of
                                   the  left  edge, top edge, bottom edge, and
                                   right edge of the rectangle, all within the
                                   underlying  video  frame. The units for the
                                   measurements are percentages. If you  spec-
                                   ify  a  value  for one of these fields, you
                                   must specify a value for all of  them.  For
                                   leftOffset,  specify  the  position  of the
                                   left edge of the rectangle, as a percentage
                                   of the underlying frame width, and relative
                                   to the left edge of the frame. For example,
                                   "10"  means  the  measurement is 10% of the
                                   underlying frame width. The rectangle  left
                                   edge  starts at that position from the left
                                   edge of the frame. This  field  corresponds
                                   to tts:origin - X in the TTML standard.

                               TopOffset -> (double)
                                   See  the  description  in  leftOffset.  For
                                   topOffset, specify the position of the  top
                                   edge  of  the rectangle, as a percentage of
                                   the underlying frame height,  and  relative
                                   to  the top edge of the frame. For example,
                                   "10" means the measurement is  10%  of  the
                                   underlying  frame height. The rectangle top
                                   edge starts at that position from  the  top
                                   edge  of  the frame. This field corresponds
                                   to tts:origin - Y in the TTML standard.

                               Width -> (double)
                                   See  the  description  in  leftOffset.  For
                                   width, specify the entire width of the rec-
                                   tangle as a percentage  of  the  underlying
                                   frame  width.  For  example, "80" means the
                                   rectangle width is 80%  of  the  underlying
                                   frame  width.  The  leftOffset  and rectan-
                                   gleWidth must add up to 100% or less.  This
                                   field  corresponds to tts:extent - X in the
                                   TTML standard.

                            PageNumber -> (string)
                               Specifies the teletext page number  within  the
                               data  stream  from  which  to extract captions.
                               Range of 0x100 (256) to  0x8FF  (2303).  Unused
                               for passthrough. Should be specified as a hexa-
                               decimal string with no "0x" prefix.

              DeblockFilter -> (string)
                 Enable or disable the deblock filter when filtering.

              DenoiseFilter -> (string)
                 Enable or disable the denoise filter when filtering.

              FilterStrength -> (integer)
                 Adjusts the magnitude of filtering  from  1  (minimal)  to  5
                 (strongest).

              InputFilter -> (string)
                 Turns  on  the  filter for this input. MPEG-2 inputs have the
                 deblocking filter enabled by default.  1)  auto  -  filtering
                 will be applied depending on input type/quality 2) disabled -
                 no filtering will be applied to the input 3) forced - filter-
                 ing will be applied regardless of input type

              NetworkInputSettings -> (structure)
                 Input settings.

                 HlsInputSettings -> (structure)
                     Specifies  HLS  input  settings when the uri is for a HLS
                     manifest.

                     Bandwidth -> (integer)
                        When specified the HLS stream with the m3u8  BANDWIDTH
                        that  most  closely matches this value will be chosen,
                        otherwise the highest bandwidth  stream  in  the  m3u8
                        will  be  chosen. The bitrate is specified in bits per
                        second, as in an HLS manifest.

                     BufferSegments -> (integer)
                        When specified, reading of the HLS  input  will  begin
                        this  many buffer segments from the end (most recently
                        written segment). When not specified,  the  HLS  input
                        will  begin  with  the  first segment specified in the
                        m3u8.

                     Retries -> (integer)
                        The number of consecutive times that attempts to  read
                        a  manifest  or  segment must fail before the input is
                        considered unavailable.

                     RetryInterval -> (integer)
                        The number of seconds between retries when an  attempt
                        to read a manifest or segment fails.

                     Scte35Source -> (string)
                        Identifies  the  source  for the SCTE-35 messages that
                        MediaLive will ingest. Messages can be  ingested  from
                        the  content  segments (in the stream) or from tags in
                        the playlist (the  HLS  manifest).  MediaLive  ignores
                        SCTE-35  information  in  the  source  that is not se-
                        lected.

                 ServerValidation -> (string)
                     Check HTTPS server certificates. When set  to  checkCryp-
                     tographyOnly,  cryptography  in  the  certificate will be
                     checked, but not the server's  name.  Certain  subdomains
                     (notably  S3 buckets that use dots in the bucket name) do
                     not strictly match the corresponding certificate's  wild-
                     card  pattern  and would otherwise cause the event to er-
                     ror. This setting is ignored for protocols  that  do  not
                     use https.

              Scte35Pid -> (integer)
                 PID  from  which to read SCTE-35 messages. If left undefined,
                 EML will select the first SCTE-35 PID found in the input.

              Smpte2038DataPreference -> (string)
                 Specifies whether to extract applicable ancillary data from a
                 SMPTE-2038  source  in  this input. Applicable data types are
                 captions, timecode, AFD, and SCTE-104 messages. - PREFER: Ex-
                 tract from SMPTE-2038 if present in this input, otherwise ex-

              SourceEndBehavior -> (string)
                 Loop  input  if  it is a file. This allows a file input to be
                 streamed indefinitely.

              VideoSelector -> (structure)
                 Informs which video elementary stream  to  decode  for  input
                 types that have multiple available.

                 ColorSpace -> (string)
                     Specifies the color space of an input. This setting works
                     in tandem with colorSpaceUsage and a video  description's
                     colorSpaceSettingsChoice  to  determine if any conversion
                     will be performed.

                        MaxCll -> (integer)
                            Maximum Content Light Level  An  integer  metadata
                            value  defining  the maximum light level, in nits,
                            of any single pixel within an  encoded  HDR  video
                            stream or file.

                        MaxFall -> (integer)
                            Maximum Frame Average Light Level An integer meta-
                            data value  defining  the  maximum  average  light
                            level, in nits, for any single frame within an en-
                            coded HDR video stream or file.

                 ColorSpaceUsage -> (string)
                     Applies only if colorSpace is a value other than  follow.
                     This field controls how the value in the colorSpace field
                     will be used. fallback means that when the input does in-
                     clude  color space data, that data will be used, but when
                     the input has no color space  data,  the  value  in  col-
                     orSpace  will  be  used. Choose fallback if your input is
                     sometimes missing color space data, but when it does have
                     color  space  data,  that data is correct. force means to
                     always use the value in colorSpace. Choose force if  your
                     input usually has no color space data or might have unre-
                     liable color space data.

                 SelectorSettings -> (structure)
                     The video selector settings.

                        Pid -> (integer)
                            Selects a specific PID from within a video source.

                     VideoSelectorProgramId -> (structure)
                        Video Selector Program Id

                        ProgramId -> (integer)
                            Selects  a  specific   program   from   within   a
                            multi-program  transport  stream.  If  the program
                            doesn't exist, the first program within the trans-
                            port stream will be selected by default.

                               the  transcode.  Inputs  that alternate between
                               DD+ and non-DD+ content will have a  consistent
                               DD+  output  as  the  system alternates between
                               passthrough and encoding.

                               All burn-in  and  DVB-Sub  font  settings  must
                               match.

                            OutlineSize -> (integer)
                               Specifies font outline size in pixels. This op-
                               tion is not valid for source captions that  are
                               either  608/embedded  or teletext. These source
                               settings are already pre-defined by the caption
                               stream.  All  burn-in and DVB-Sub font settings
                               must match.

                            ShadowColor -> (string)
                               Specifies the color of the shadow cast  by  the
                               captions. All burn-in and DVB-Sub font settings
                               must match.

                            ShadowOpacity -> (integer)
                               Specifies the opacity of  the  shadow.  255  is
                               opaque;  0 is transparent. Leaving this parame-
                               ter blank is equivalent  to  setting  it  to  0
                               (transparent).  All  burn-in  and  DVB-Sub font
                               settings must match.

                            ShadowXOffset -> (integer)
                               Specifies the horizontal offset of  the  shadow
                               relative  to the captions in pixels. A value of
                               -2 would result in a shadow offset 2 pixels  to
                               the left. All burn-in and DVB-Sub font settings
                               must match.

                            ShadowYOffset -> (integer)
                               Specifies the vertical  offset  of  the  shadow
                               relative  to the captions in pixels. A value of
                               -2 would result in a  shadow  offset  2  pixels
                               above  the  text.  All burn-in and DVB-Sub font
                               settings must match.

                            TeletextGridControl -> (string)
                               Controls whether a fixed grid size will be used
                               to  generate  the output subtitles bitmap. Only
                               applicable    for    Teletext    inputs     and
                               DVB-Sub/Burn-in outputs.

                            XPosition -> (integer)
                               Specifies  the  horizontal position of the cap-
                               tion relative to the left side of the output in
                               pixels.  A value of 10 would result in the cap-
                               tions starting 10 pixels from the left  of  the
                               output.  If  no explicit xPosition is provided,
                               the horizontal caption position will be  deter-
                               mined  by  the alignment parameter. This option
                               is not valid for source captions that are  STL,
                               608/embedded or teletext. These source settings
                               are already pre-defined by the caption  stream.
                               All  burn-in  and  DVB-Sub  font  settings must
                               match.

                            YPosition -> (integer)
                               Specifies the vertical position of the  caption
                               relative  to the top of the output in pixels. A
                               value of 10 would result in the captions start-
                               ing 10 pixels from the top of the output. If no
                               explicit yPosition  is  provided,  the  caption
                               will  be  positioned  towards the bottom of the
                               output. This option is  not  valid  for  source
                               captions  that  are  STL, 608/embedded or tele-
                               text. These source settings are already pre-de-

                               well  as  the other manifests (according to the

                               contains a #EXT-X-I-FRAMES-ONLY tag to indicate
                               it  is  I-frame   only,   and   one   or   more

                            IncompleteSegmentBehavior -> (string)
                               Specifies  whether to include the final (incom-
                               plete) segment in the  media  output  when  the
                               pipeline  stops  producing  output because of a
                               channel stop, a channel pause or a loss of  in-
                               put  to the pipeline. Auto means that MediaLive
                               decides whether to include the  final  segment,
                               depending on the channel class and the types of
                               output groups. Suppress means to never  include
                               the incomplete segment. We recommend you choose
                               Auto and let MediaLive control the behavior.

                            IndexNSegments -> (integer)
                               Applies only if Mode field is  LIVE.  Specifies
                               the  maximum  number  of  segments in the media
                               manifest file. After this maximum,  older  seg-
                               ments are removed from the media manifest. This
                               number must be smaller than the number  in  the
                               Keep Segments field.

                            InputLossAction -> (string)
                               Parameter that control output group behavior on
                               input loss.

                            IvInManifest -> (string)
                               For use with encryptionType. The  IV  (Initial-
                               ization  Vector)  is  a  128-bit number used in
                               conjunction with the key for encrypting blocks.
                               If  set to "include", IV is listed in the mani-
                               fest, otherwise the IV is not in the manifest.

                            IvSource -> (string)
                               For use with encryptionType. The  IV  (Initial-
                               ization  Vector)  is  a  128-bit number used in
                               conjunction with the key for encrypting blocks.
                               If  this  setting is "followsSegmentNumber", it
                               will cause the IV to change every  segment  (to
                               match  the  segment  number). If this is set to
                               "explicit", you must enter a constantIv value.

                            KeepSegments -> (integer)
                               Applies only if Mode field is  LIVE.  Specifies
                               the  number  of media segments to retain in the
                               destination directory. This  number  should  be
                               bigger  than  indexNSegments (Num segments). We
                               recommend (value = (2 x indexNsegments)  +  1).
                               If  this "keep segments" number is too low, the
                               following might happen:  the  player  is  still
                               reading  a  media manifest file that lists this
                               segment, but that segment has been removed from
                               the  destination  directory (as directed by in-
                               dexNSegments). This situation would result in a
                               404 HTTP error on the player.

                            KeyFormat -> (string)

                               in the resource identified by the URI.  If  pa-
                               rameter  is absent, an implicit value of "iden-
                               tity" is used. A reverse DNS string can also be
                               given.

                            KeyFormatVersions -> (string)

                               vent players from rewinding all the way to  the
                               beginning  of  the  event.  VOD  mode  uses HLS

                            OutputSelection -> (string)
                               MANIFESTS_AND_SEGMENTS:   Generates   manifests
                               (master manifest, if applicable, and media man-
                               ifests) for this  output  group.  VARIANT_MANI-
                               FESTS_AND_SEGMENTS:  Generates  media manifests
                               for this output group, but not a  master  mani-
                               fest. SEGMENTS_ONLY: Does not generate any man-
                               ifests for this output group.

                            ProgramDateTime -> (string)
                               Includes  or  excludes  EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME
                               tag  in .m3u8 manifest files. The value is cal-
                               culated using the program date time clock.

                            ProgramDateTimeClock -> (string)
                               Specifies the algorithm used to drive  the  HLS
                               EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME clock. Options include:
                               INITIALIZE_FROM_OUTPUT_TIMECODE: The PDT  clock
                               is  initialized as a function of the first out-
                               put timecode, then incremented  by  the  EXTINF
                               duration of each encoded segment. SYSTEM_CLOCK:
                               The PDT clock is initialized as a  function  of
                               the UTC wall clock, then incremented by the EX-
                               TINF duration of each encoded segment.  If  the
                               PDT  clock diverges from the wall clock by more
                               than 500ms, it is resynchronized  to  the  wall
                               clock.

                            ProgramDateTimePeriod -> (integer)
                               Period  of insertion of EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME
                               entry, in seconds.

                            RedundantManifest -> (string)
                               ENABLED: The master manifest (.m3u8  file)  for
                               each  pipeline  includes information about both
                               pipelines: first its own media files, then  the
                               media files of the other pipeline. This feature
                               allows playout device that support stale  mani-
                               fest  detection  to switch from one manifest to
                               the other, when the current manifest  seems  to
                               be  stale. There are still two destinations and
                               two master manifests, but both master manifests
                               reference  the media files from both pipelines.
                               DISABLED: The master manifest (.m3u8 file)  for
                               each  pipeline  includes  information about its
                               own pipeline only. For an HLS output group with
                               MediaPackage  as  the destination, the DISABLED
                               behavior is always followed.  MediaPackage  re-
                               generates the manifests it serves to players so
                               a redundant manifest from MediaLive is  irrele-
                               vant.

                            SegmentLength -> (integer)
                               Length  of  MPEG-2 Transport Stream segments to
                               create (in seconds). Note  that  segments  will
                               end  on  the next keyframe after this number of
                               seconds,  so  actual  segment  length  may   be
                               longer.

                            SegmentationMode -> (string)
                               useInputSegmentation  has  been deprecated. The
                               configured segment size is always used.

                            SegmentsPerSubdirectory -> (integer)
                               Number of segments to write to  a  subdirectory
                               before  starting  a new one. directoryStructure
                               must be subdirectoryPerStream for this  setting
                               to have an effect.

                            StreamInfResolution -> (string)
                               Include  or  exclude  RESOLUTION  attribute for
                               video in EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag of variant  mani-
                               fest.

                            TimedMetadataId3Frame -> (string)
                               Indicates ID3 frame that has the timecode.

                            TimedMetadataId3Period -> (integer)
                               Timed Metadata interval in seconds.

                            TimestampDeltaMilliseconds -> (integer)
                               Provides  an  extra millisecond delta offset to
                               fine tune the timestamps.

                            TsFileMode -> (string)
                               SEGMENTED_FILES: Emit the program as segments -
                               multiple  .ts media files. SINGLE_FILE: Applies
                               only if Mode field is VOD. Emit the program  as
                               a single .ts media file. The media manifest in-
                               cludes #EXT-X-BYTERANGE tags to index  segments
                               for  playback.  A typical use for this value is
                               when sending the output to AWS Elemental Media-
                               Convert,  which  can accept only a single media
                               file. Playback while the channel is running  is
                               not guaranteed due to HTTP server caching.

                               The ID to include in each message in the sparse
                               track. Ignored if sparseTrackType is NONE.

                            AudioOnlyTimecodeControl -> (string)
                               If set to  passthrough  for  an  audio-only  MS
                               Smooth  output, the fragment absolute time will
                               be set to the  current  timecode.  This  option
                               does  not  write timecodes to the audio elemen-
                               tary stream.

                            CertificateMode -> (string)
                               If set to verifyAuthenticity, verify the  https
                               certificate  chain to a trusted Certificate Au-
                               thority (CA). This will cause https outputs  to
                               self-signed certificates to fail.

                            ConnectionRetryInterval -> (integer)
                               Number  of seconds to wait before retrying con-
                               nection to the IIS server if the connection  is
                               lost.  Content  will be cached during this time
                               and the cache will be be delivered to  the  IIS
                               server once the connection is re-established.

                            Destination -> (structure)
                               Smooth   Streaming  publish  point  on  an  IIS
                               server. Elemental Live acts as a "Push" encoder
                               to IIS.

                               DestinationRefId -> (string)

                               Specifies whether or not to send an event ID to
                               the IIS server. If no event ID is sent and  the
                               same  Live  Event  is used without changing the
                               publishing  point,  clients  might  see  cached
                               video  from the previous run. Options: - "useC-
                               onfigured" - use the value provided in  eventId
                               -  "useTimestamp"  - generate and send an event
                               ID based on the current timestamp - "noEventId"
                               - do not send an event ID to the IIS server.

                            EventStopBehavior -> (string)
                               When  set  to  sendEos,  send EOS signal to IIS

                            RestartDelay -> (integer)
                               Number of seconds before initiating  a  restart
                               due  to  output  failure, due to exhausting the
                               numRetries on one segment, or  exceeding  file-
                               cacheDuration.

                            SegmentationMode -> (string)
                               useInputSegmentation  has  been deprecated. The
                               configured segment size is always used.

                            SendDelayMs -> (integer)
                               Number of milliseconds to delay the output from

                               SCTE35_WITHOUT_SEGMENTATION:   Insert   SCTE-35
                               messages from the  source  content.  With  each
                               message,  insert an IDR frame but don't start a
                               new segment. - NONE: Don't  generate  a  sparse
                               track for any outputs in this output group.

                               Authentication scheme to  use  when  connecting
                               with CDN

                            CacheFullBehavior -> (string)
                               Controls  behavior when content cache fills up.
                               If remote origin server stalls the RTMP connec-
                               tion  and  does  not accept content fast enough
                               the 'Media Cache' will fill up. When the  cache
                               reaches  the  duration specified by cacheLength
                               the cache will stop accepting new  content.  If
                               set  to  disconnectImmediately, the RTMP output
                               will force a disconnect. Clear the media cache,
                               and  reconnect  after  restartDelay seconds. If
                               set to waitForServer, the RTMP output will wait
                               up  to  5 minutes to allow the origin server to
                               begin accepting data again.

                            CacheLength -> (integer)
                               Cache length, in seconds, is used to  calculate
                               buffer size.

                            CaptionData -> (string)
                               Controls  the  types of data that passes to on-
                               CaptionInfo outputs. If set to 'all'  then  608
                               and  708  carried DTVCC data will be passed. If
                               set to  'field1AndField2608'  then  DTVCC  data
                               will  be  stripped  out, but 608 data from both
                               fields will be passed. If  set  to  'field1608'
                               then  only the data carried in 608 from field 1
                               video will be passed.

                            InputLossAction -> (string)
                               Controls the behavior of this RTMP group if in-
                               put  becomes  unavailable. - emitOutput: Emit a
                               slate until input returns. - pauseOutput:  Stop
                               transmitting  data  until  input  returns. This
                               does not close the underlying RTMP connection.

                            RestartDelay -> (integer)
                               If a streaming output fails, number of  seconds
                               to  wait  until a restart is initiated. A value
                               of 0 means never restart.

                               Specifies behavior of last  resort  when  input
                               video  is  lost,  and no more backup inputs are
                               available. When dropTs is selected  the  entire
                               transport  stream will stop being emitted. When
                               dropProgram is  selected  the  program  can  be
                               dropped from the transport stream (and replaced
                               with null packets to meet the  TS  bitrate  re-
                               quirement).  Or, when emitProgram is chosen the
                               transport stream will continue to  be  produced
                               normally  with  repeat frames, black frames, or
                               slate frames substituted for the  absent  input

                                             The segmentation style  parameter
                                             controls how segmentation markers
                                             are inserted into  the  transport
                                             stream. With avails, it is possi-
                                             ble that segments  may  be  trun-
                                             cated,  which can influence where
                                             future segmentation  markers  are
                                             inserted.   When  a  segmentation
                                             style of  "resetCadence"  is  se-
                                             lected and a segment is truncated
                                             due to an avail,  we  will  reset
                                             the  segmentation  cadence.  This
                                             means the subsequent segment will
                                             have a duration of $segmentation-
                                             Time seconds. When a segmentation
                                             style of "maintainCadence" is se-
                                             lected and a segment is truncated
                                             due  to an avail, we will not re-
                                             set  the  segmentation   cadence.
                                             This means the subsequent segment
                                             will likely be truncated as well.
                                             However,  all segments after that
                                             will have a duration of  $segmen-
                                             tationTime seconds. Note that EBP
                                             lookahead is a  slight  exception
                                             to this rule.

                                          SegmentationStyle -> (string)
                                             The  segmentation style parameter
                                             controls how segmentation markers
                                             are  inserted  into the transport
                                             stream. With avails, it is possi-
                                             ble  that  segments  may be trun-
                                             cated, which can influence  where
                                             future  segmentation  markers are
                                             inserted.  When  a   segmentation
                                             style  of  "resetCadence"  is se-
                                             lected and a segment is truncated
                                             due  to  an  avail, we will reset
                                             the  segmentation  cadence.  This
                                             means the subsequent segment will
                                             have a duration of $segmentation-
                                             Time seconds. When a segmentation
                                             style of "maintainCadence" is se-
                                             lected and a segment is truncated
                                             due to an avail, we will not  re-
                                             set   the  segmentation  cadence.
                                             This means the subsequent segment
                                             will likely be truncated as well.
                                             However, all segments after  that
                                             will  have a duration of $segmen-
                                             tationTime seconds. Note that EBP
                                             lookahead  is  a slight exception
                                             to this rule.

                     source, the system falls back to using "Start at 0" (zer-
                     obased).  -System  Clock (systemclock): Use the UTC time.
                     -Start at 0 (zerobased): The time of the first  frame  of
                     the event will be 00:00:00:00.

                     Threshold  in  frames  beyond  which  output  timecode is
                     resynchronized to the input timecode. Discrepancies below
                     this threshold are permitted to avoid unnecessary discon-

                               video on a frame-by-frame basis to produce more
                               compression  without  losing quality. There are
                               three types of adaptive quantization:  flicker,
                               spatial,  and temporal. Set the field in one of
                               these ways: Set to Auto. Recommended. For  each
                               type  of  AQ, MediaLive will determine if AQ is
                               needed, and if so,  the  appropriate  strength.
                               Set a strength (a value other than Auto or Dis-
                               able). This strength will apply to any  of  the
                               AQ  fields  that  you  choose to enable. Set to
                               Disabled to disable all types of adaptive quan-
                               tization.

                            AfdSignaling -> (string)
                               Indicates  that AFD values will be written into
                               the output stream. If afdSignaling  is  "auto",
                               the  system  will try to preserve the input AFD
                               value (in cases where multiple AFD  values  are
                               valid).  If  set to "fixed", the AFD value will
                               be the value configured in the fixedAfd parame-
                               ter.

                            Bitrate -> (integer)
                               Average  bitrate  in bits/second. Required when
                               the rate control mode is VBR or CBR.  Not  used
                               for  QVBR.  In  an MS Smooth output group, each
                               output must have a unique value  when  its  bi-
                               trate  is  rounded down to the nearest multiple
                               of 1000.

                            BufFillPct -> (integer)
                               Percentage of the buffer that should  initially
                               be filled (HRD buffer model).

                            BufSize -> (integer)
                               Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in bits.

                            ColorMetadata -> (string)
                               Includes colorspace metadata in the output.

                            ColorSpaceSettings -> (structure)

                               ColorSpacePassthroughSettings -> (structure)
                                   Passthrough  applies no color space conver-
                                   sion to the output

                            EntropyEncoding -> (string)
                               Entropy encoding mode. Use cabac  (must  be  in
                               Main or High profile) or cavlc.

                            FilterSettings -> (structure)
                               Optional  filters  that you can apply to an en-
                               code.

                               TemporalFilterSettings -> (structure)
                                   Temporal Filter Settings

                                   PostFilterSharpening -> (string)
                                      If you enable this filter,  the  results
                                      are  the following: - If the source con-
                                      tent is  noisy  (it  contains  excessive
                                      digital artifacts), the filter cleans up
                                      the source. - If the source  content  is
                                      already  clean,  the filter tends to de-
                                      crease the bitrate, especially when  the
                                      rate control mode is QVBR.

                                   Strength -> (string)
                                      Choose a filter strength. We recommend a
                                      strength of 1 or 2.  A  higher  strength
                                      might take out good information, result-
                                      ing in an image that is overly soft.

                            FixedAfd -> (string)
                               Four bit AFD value to write on  all  frames  of
                               video  in  the  output  stream. Only valid when
                               afdSignaling is set to 'Fixed'.

                            FlickerAq -> (string)
                               Flicker AQ makes adjustments within each  frame
                               to  reduce  flicker  or  'pop' on I-frames. The
                               value to enter in this  field  depends  on  the
                               value  in  the  Adaptive quantization field: If
                               you have set the Adaptive quantization field to
                               Auto,  MediaLive  ignores  any  value  in  this
                               field. MediaLive will determine if  flicker  AQ
                               is  appropriate  and will apply the appropriate
                               strength. If you have set the Adaptive  quanti-
                               zation  field  to  a strength, you can set this
                               field to Enabled or  Disabled.  Enabled:  Medi-
                               aLive will apply flicker AQ using the specified
                               strength.  Disabled:  MediaLive   won't   apply
                               flicker  AQ. If you have set the Adaptive quan-
                               tization to  Disabled,  MediaLive  ignores  any
                               value  in  this field and doesn't apply flicker
                               AQ.

                            ForceFieldPictures -> (string)
                               This setting applies only  when  scan  type  is
                               "interlaced."  It  controls  whether  coding is
                               performed on a field basis or on a frame basis.
                               (When  the  video is progressive, the coding is
                               always performed on a  frame  basis.)  enabled:
                               Force  MediaLive  to  code on a field basis, so
                               that odd and even sets of fields are coded sep-
                               arately.  disabled: Code the two sets of fields
                               separately (on a field basis) or together (on a
                               frame  basis  using PAFF), depending on what is
                               most appropriate for the content.

                            FramerateControl -> (string)
                               This field indicates how the output video frame
                               rate  is  specified. If "specified" is selected
                               then the output video frame rate is  determined
                               by framerateNumerator and framerateDenominator,
                               else if "initializeFromSource" is selected then
                               the  output  video frame rate will be set equal
                               to the input video frame rate of the first  in-
                               put.

                            FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                               Framerate denominator.

                            FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                               Framerate  numerator - framerate is a fraction,
                               e.g. 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps.

                            GopBReference -> (string)
                               Documentation update needed

                            GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                               Frequency of closed GOPs. In streaming applica-
                               tions,  it is recommended that this be set to 1
                               so a decoder joining mid-stream will receive an
                               IDR  frame as quickly as possible. Setting this
                               value to 0 will break output segmenting.

                            GopNumBFrames -> (integer)
                               Number of B-frames between reference frames.

                            GopSize -> (double)
                               GOP size (keyframe interval) in units of either
                               frames or seconds per gopSizeUnits. If gopSize-
                               Units is frames, gopSize must be an integer and
                               must be greater than or equal to 1. If gopSize-
                               Units is seconds, gopSize must be greater  than
                               0, but need not be an integer.

                            GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                               Indicates if the gopSize is specified in frames
                               or seconds. If seconds the system will  convert
                               the gopSize into a frame count at run time.

                            Level -> (string)
                               H.264 Level.

                            LookAheadRateControl -> (string)
                               Amount  of  lookahead.  A  value of low can de-
                               crease latency and memory usage, while high can
                               produce better quality for certain content.

                            MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                               For QVBR: See the tooltip for Quality level For
                               VBR: Set the maximum bitrate in order to accom-
                               modate expected spikes in the complexity of the
                               video.

                            MinIInterval -> (integer)
                               Only meaningful if sceneChangeDetect is set  to
                               enabled.  Defaults  to 5 if multiplex rate con-
                               trol is used. Enforces separation  between  re-
                               peated (cadence) I-frames and I-frames inserted
                               by Scene Change Detection. If  a  scene  change
                               I-frame  is  within  I-interval frames of a ca-
                               dence  I-frame,  the  GOP  is   shrunk   and/or
                               stretched  to  the  scene  change  I-frame. GOP
                               stretch requires enabling lookahead as well  as
                               setting  I-interval. The normal cadence resumes
                               for the next GOP. Note: Maximum GOP  stretch  =
                               GOP size + Min-I-interval - 1

                            NumRefFrames -> (integer)
                               Number  of reference frames to use. The encoder
                               may use more than requested if  using  B-frames
                               and/or interlaced encoding.

                            ParControl -> (string)
                               This  field  indicates how the output pixel as-
                               pect ratio is specified. If "specified" is  se-
                               lected then the output video pixel aspect ratio
                               is determined by parNumerator and  parDenomina-
                               tor, else if "initializeFromSource" is selected
                               then the output pixsel aspect ratio will be set
                               equal  to the input video pixel aspect ratio of
                               the first input.

                            ParDenominator -> (integer)
                               Pixel Aspect Ratio denominator.

                            ParNumerator -> (integer)
                               Pixel Aspect Ratio numerator.

                            Profile -> (string)
                               H.264 Profile.

                            QualityLevel -> (string)
                               Leave as STANDARD_QUALITY or choose a different
                               value  (which  might result in additional costs
                               to run the channel). -  ENHANCED_QUALITY:  Pro-
                               duces  a  slightly better video quality without
                               an increase in the bitrate. Has an effect  only
                               when  the  Rate control mode is QVBR or CBR. If
                               this channel is in a MediaLive  multiplex,  the
                               value   must   be   ENHANCED_QUALITY.  -  STAN-
                               DARD_QUALITY: Valid for any Rate control mode.

                            QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                               Controls the target quality for the  video  en-
                               code.  Applies  only when the rate control mode
                               is QVBR. You can set a target  quality  or  you
                               can  let  MediaLive determine the best quality.
                               To set a target quality, enter  values  in  the
                               QVBR  quality  level  field and the Max bitrate
                               field. Enter values that suit your most  impor-
                               tant viewing devices. Recommended values are: -
                               Primary screen: Quality level: 8 to 10. Max bi-
                               trate: 4M - PC or tablet: Quality level: 7. Max
                               bitrate:  1.5M  to  3M  -  Smartphone:  Quality
                               level:  6. Max bitrate: 1M to 1.5M To let Medi-
                               aLive decide,  leave  the  QVBR  quality  level
                               field empty, and in Max bitrate enter the maxi-
                               mum rate you want in the video. For more infor-

                               control mode" in the MediaLive user guide

                            RateControlMode -> (string)
                               Rate control mode. QVBR: Quality will match the
                               specified  quality level except when it is con-
                               strained by the maximum bitrate. Recommended if
                               you  or  your  viewers  pay for bandwidth. VBR:
                               Quality and  bitrate  vary,  depending  on  the
                               video  complexity.  Recommended instead of QVBR
                               if you want to maintain a specific average  bi-
                               trate  over  the  duration of the channel. CBR:
                               Quality varies, depending on the video complex-
                               ity.  Recommended  only  if you distribute your
                               assets to devices that cannot  handle  variable
                               bitrates.  Multiplex: This rate control mode is
                               only supported (and is required) when the video
                               is  being delivered to a MediaLive Multiplex in
                               which case the rate  control  configuration  is
                               controlled  by the properties within the Multi-
                               plex Program.

                            ScanType -> (string)
                               Sets the scan type of the output to progressive
                               or top-field-first interlaced.

                            SceneChangeDetect -> (string)
                               Scene  change detection. - On: inserts I-frames
                               when scene change is detected. - Off: does  not
                               force an I-frame when scene change is detected.

                            Slices -> (integer)
                               Number of slices per picture. Must be less than
                               or equal to the number of macroblock  rows  for
                               progressive pictures, and less than or equal to
                               half the number of macroblock rows  for  inter-
                               laced pictures. This field is optional; when no
                               value is specified the encoder will choose  the
                               number of slices based on encode resolution.

                            Softness -> (integer)
                               Softness. Selects quantizer matrix, larger val-
                               ues reduce high-frequency content  in  the  en-
                               coded  image.  If  not  set  to  zero,  must be
                               greater than 15.

                            SpatialAq -> (string)
                               Spatial AQ makes adjustments within each  frame
                               based  on spatial variation of content complex-
                               ity. The value to enter in this  field  depends
                               on  the  value  in  the  Adaptive  quantization
                               field: If you have set the  Adaptive  quantiza-
                               tion field to Auto, MediaLive ignores any value
                               in this field. MediaLive will determine if spa-
                               tial  AQ  is appropriate and will apply the ap-
                               propriate strength. If you have set  the  Adap-
                               tive  quantization field to a strength, you can
                               set this field to Enabled or Disabled. Enabled:
                               MediaLive will apply spatial AQ using the spec-
                               ified strength. Disabled: MediaLive won't apply
                               spatial  AQ. If you have set the Adaptive quan-
                               tization to  Disabled,  MediaLive  ignores  any
                               value  in  this field and doesn't apply spatial
                               AQ.

                            SubgopLength -> (string)
                               If set to fixed, use gopNumBFrames B-frames per
                               sub-GOP. If set to dynamic, optimize the number
                               of B-frames used for each  sub-GOP  to  improve
                               visual quality.

                            Syntax -> (string)

                               Temporal makes adjustments  within  each  frame
                               based on temporal variation of content complex-
                               ity. The value to enter in this  field  depends
                               on  the  value  in  the  Adaptive  quantization
                               field: If you have set the  Adaptive  quantiza-
                               tion field to Auto, MediaLive ignores any value
                               in this field. MediaLive will determine if tem-
                               poral  AQ is appropriate and will apply the ap-

                               tive  quantization field to a strength, you can
                               set this field to Enabled or Disabled. Enabled:
                               MediaLive  will  apply  temporal  AQ  using the
                               specified strength. Disabled:  MediaLive  won't
                               apply temporal AQ. If you have set the Adaptive
                               quantization to Disabled, MediaLive ignores any
                               value  in this field and doesn't apply temporal

                            AfdSignaling -> (string)
                               Indicates  that AFD values will be written into
                               the output stream. If afdSignaling  is  "auto",
                               the  system  will try to preserve the input AFD
                               value (in cases where multiple AFD  values  are
                               valid).  If  set to "fixed", the AFD value will
                               be the value configured in the fixedAfd parame-
                               ter.

                               Average bitrate in bits/second.  Required  when
                               the  rate  control mode is VBR or CBR. Not used
                               for QVBR. In an MS Smooth  output  group,  each
                               output  must  have  a unique value when its bi-
                               trate is rounded down to the  nearest  multiple
                               of 1000.

                                   PostFilterSharpening -> (string)
                                      If  you  enable this filter, the results
                                      are the following: - If the source  con-
                                      tent  is  noisy  (it  contains excessive
                                      digital artifacts), the filter cleans up
                                      the  source.  - If the source content is
                                      already clean, the filter tends  to  de-
                                      crease  the bitrate, especially when the
                                      rate control mode is QVBR.

                                   Strength -> (string)
                                      Choose a filter strength. We recommend a
                                      strength  of  1  or 2. A higher strength
                                      might take out good information, result-
                                      ing in an image that is overly soft.

                            FixedAfd -> (string)

                               each  frame  to  reduce  flicker  or  'pop'  on
                               I-frames.

                            FramerateDenominator -> (integer)

                               Framerate  numerator - framerate is a fraction,
                               e.g. 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps.

                            GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                               Frequency of closed GOPs. In streaming applica-
                               tions,  it is recommended that this be set to 1
                               so a decoder joining mid-stream will receive an
                               IDR  frame as quickly as possible. Setting this
                               value to 0 will break output segmenting.

                            GopSize -> (double)
                               GOP size (keyframe interval) in units of either
                               frames or seconds per gopSizeUnits. If gopSize-
                               Units is frames, gopSize must be an integer and
                               must be greater than or equal to 1. If gopSize-
                               Units is seconds, gopSize must be greater  than
                               0, but need not be an integer.

                            GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                               Indicates if the gopSize is specified in frames
                               or seconds. If seconds the system will  convert
                               the gopSize into a frame count at run time.

                            Level -> (string)
                               H.265 Level.

                            LookAheadRateControl -> (string)
                               Amount  of  lookahead.  A  value of low can de-
                               crease latency and memory usage, while high can
                               produce better quality for certain content.

                            MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                               For QVBR: See the tooltip for Quality level

                            MinIInterval -> (integer)
                               Only  meaningful if sceneChangeDetect is set to
                               enabled. Defaults to 5 if multiplex  rate  con-
                               trol  is  used. Enforces separation between re-
                               peated (cadence) I-frames and I-frames inserted
                               by  Scene  Change  Detection. If a scene change
                               I-frame is within I-interval frames  of  a  ca-
                               dence   I-frame,   the  GOP  is  shrunk  and/or
                               stretched to  the  scene  change  I-frame.  GOP
                               stretch  requires enabling lookahead as well as
                               setting I-interval. The normal cadence  resumes
                               for  the  next GOP. Note: Maximum GOP stretch =
                               GOP size + Min-I-interval - 1

                            ParDenominator -> (integer)

                            ParNumerator -> (integer)
                               Pixel Aspect Ratio numerator.

                            Profile -> (string)
                               H.265 Profile.

                            QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                               Controls the target quality for the  video  en-
                               code.  Applies  only when the rate control mode
                               is QVBR. Set values for the QVBR quality  level
                               field and Max bitrate field that suit your most
                               important viewing devices.  Recommended  values
                               are:  - Primary screen: Quality level: 8 to 10.
                               Max bitrate: 4M - PC or tablet: Quality  level:
                               7.  Max bitrate: 1.5M to 3M - Smartphone: Qual-

                            RateControlMode -> (string)
                               Rate control mode. QVBR: Quality will match the
                               specified  quality level except when it is con-
                               strained by the maximum bitrate. Recommended if
                               you  or  your  viewers  pay for bandwidth. CBR:
                               Quality varies, depending on the video complex-
                               ity.  Recommended  only  if you distribute your
                               assets to devices that cannot  handle  variable
                               bitrates.  Multiplex: This rate control mode is
                               only supported (and is required) when the video
                               is  being delivered to a MediaLive Multiplex in
                               which case the rate  control  configuration  is
                               controlled  by the properties within the Multi-
                               plex Program.

                            ScanType -> (string)
                               Sets the scan type of the output to progressive
                               or top-field-first interlaced.

                            SceneChangeDetect -> (string)
                               Scene change detection.

                            Slices -> (integer)
                               Number of slices per picture. Must be less than
                               or equal to the number of macroblock  rows  for
                               progressive pictures, and less than or equal to
                               half the number of macroblock rows  for  inter-
                               laced pictures. This field is optional; when no
                               value is specified the encoder will choose  the
                               number of slices based on encode resolution.

                            Tier -> (string)
                               H.265 Tier.

                            TimecodeInsertion -> (string)
                               Determines  how  timecodes  should  be inserted
                               into the video elementary stream. - 'disabled':
                               Do not include timecodes - 'picTimingSei': Pass
                               through picture timing SEI  messages  from  the
                               source specified in Timecode Config

                            AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                               Choose Off to disable adaptive quantization. Or
                               choose another value to  enable  the  quantizer
                               and  set its strength. The strengths are: Auto,
                               Off, Low, Medium, High. When  you  enable  this
                               field,  MediaLive allows intra-frame quantizers
                               to vary, which might improve visual quality.

                            AfdSignaling -> (string)
                               Indicates the AFD values  that  MediaLive  will
                               write into the video encode. If you do not know
                               what AFD signaling is, or  if  your  downstream
                               system has not given you guidance, choose AUTO.
                               AUTO: MediaLive will try to preserve the  input
                               AFD  value  (in cases where multiple AFD values
                               are valid). FIXED: MediaLive will use the value
                               you specify in fixedAFD.

                            ColorMetadata -> (string)
                               Specifies  whether  to  include the color space
                               metadata.  The  metadata  describes  the  color
                               space that applies to the video (the colorSpace
                               field). We recommend that you insert the  meta-
                               data.

                            ColorSpace -> (string)
                               Choose  the  type  of color space conversion to
                               apply to the output. For  detailed  information
                               on  setting up both the input and the output to
                               obtain the desired color space in  the  output,
                               see  the section on "MediaLive Features - Video
                               - color space" in  the  MediaLive  User  Guide.
                               PASSTHROUGH:  Keep the color space of the input
                               content - do not convert it.  AUTO:Convert  all
                               content  that is SD to rec 601, and convert all
                               content that is HD to rec 709.

                            DisplayAspectRatio -> (string)
                               Sets the pixel aspect ratio for the encode.

                            FilterSettings -> (structure)
                               Optionally specify a  noise  reduction  filter,
                               which  can  improve  quality of compressed con-
                               tent. If you do not choose a filter, no  filter
                               will  be applied. TEMPORAL: This filter is use-
                               ful for both source content that is noisy (when
                               it  has excessive digital artifacts) and source
                               content that is  clean.  When  the  content  is
                               noisy,  the filter cleans up the source content
                               before the encoding phase, with these  two  ef-
                               fects:  First,  it  improves  the  output video
                               quality because the content  has  been  cleaned
                               up.  Secondly,  it  decreases the bandwidth be-
                               cause MediaLive does not waste bits on encoding
                               noise.  When  the  content is reasonably clean,
                               the filter tends to decrease the bitrate.

                                   PostFilterSharpening -> (string)
                                      If you enable this filter,  the  results
                                      are  the following: - If the source con-
                                      tent is  noisy  (it  contains  excessive
                                      digital artifacts), the filter cleans up
                                      the source. - If the source  content  is
                                      already  clean,  the filter tends to de-
                                      crease the bitrate, especially when  the
                                      rate control mode is QVBR.

                                   Strength -> (string)
                                      Choose a filter strength. We recommend a
                                      strength of 1 or 2.  A  higher  strength
                                      might take out good information, result-
                                      ing in an image that is overly soft.

                            FixedAfd -> (string)
                               Complete this field only when  afdSignaling  is
                               set  to  FIXED. Enter the AFD value (4 bits) to
                               write on all frames of the video encode.

                            FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                               description": "The framerate  denominator.  For
                               example,  1001.  The framerate is the numerator
                               divided by the denominator. For example,  24000
                               / 1001 = 23.976 FPS.

                            FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                               The  framerate  numerator.  For example, 24000.
                               The framerate is the numerator divided  by  the

                               MPEG2: default is open GOP.

                            GopNumBFrames -> (integer)
                               Relates to the GOP  structure.  The  number  of
                               B-frames  between  reference  frames. If you do
                               not know what a B-frame is, use the default.

                            GopSize -> (double)
                               Relates to the  GOP  structure.  The  GOP  size
                               (keyframe  interval)  in the units specified in

                               use  the  default.  If  gopSizeUnits is frames,
                               then the gopSize must be an integer and must be
                               greater  than or equal to 1. If gopSizeUnits is
                               seconds, the gopSize must be  greater  than  0,
                               but does not need to be an integer.

                            GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                               Relates to the GOP structure. Specifies whether
                               the gopSize is specified in frames or  seconds.
                               If  you  do not plan to change the default gop-
                               Size, leave the default. If  you  specify  SEC-
                               ONDS, MediaLive will internally convert the gop
                               size to a frame count.

                               or INTERLACED (top field first).

                            SubgopLength -> (string)
                               Relates  to  the  GOP  structure. If you do not
                               know what GOP is, use the default.  FIXED:  Set
                               the  number  of B-frames in each sub-GOP to the
                               value in gopNumBFrames. DYNAMIC: Let  MediaLive
                               optimize   the   number  of  B-frames  in  each
                               sub-GOP, to improve visual quality.

                            TimecodeInsertion -> (string)
                               Determines how MediaLive inserts  timecodes  in
                               the  output  video.  For  detailed  information
                               about setting up the input and the output for a
                               timecode,  see  the  section on "MediaLive Fea-
                               tures - Timecode configuration"  in  the  Medi-
                               aLive  User  Guide.  DISABLED:  do  not include
                               timecodes. GOP_TIMECODE: Include timecode meta-
                               data in the GOP header.

                     Height -> (integer)
                        Output  video  height, in pixels. Must be an even num-
                        ber. For most codecs, you can  leave  this  field  and
                        width blank in order to use the height and width (res-
                        olution) from the source. Note, however, that  leaving
                        blank is not recommended. For the Frame Capture codec,
                        height and width are required.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of this VideoDescription.  Outputs  will  use
                        this  name  to uniquely identify this Description. De-
                        scription names should  be  unique  within  this  Live
                        Event.

                     RespondToAfd -> (string)
                        Indicates how MediaLive will respond to the AFD values
                        that might be in the input video. If you do  not  know
                        what  AFD  signaling  is, or if your downstream system
                        has not given you guidance,  choose  PASSTHROUGH.  RE-
                        SPOND: MediaLive clips the input video using a formula
                        that uses the AFD values (configured  in  afdSignaling
                        ), the input display aspect ratio, and the output dis-
                        play aspect ratio. MediaLive  also  includes  the  AFD
                        values in the output, unless the codec for this encode
                        is FRAME_CAPTURE. PASSTHROUGH: MediaLive  ignores  the
                        AFD  values and does not clip the video. But MediaLive
                        does include the values in the output. NONE: MediaLive
                        does not clip the input video and does not include the
                        AFD values in the output

                     ScalingBehavior -> (string)
                        STRETCH_TO_OUTPUT configures the  output  position  to
                        stretch  the  video to the specified output resolution
                        (height and width). This option will override any  po-
                        sition  value.  DEFAULT may insert black boxes (pillar
                        boxes or letter boxes) around the video to provide the
                        specified output resolution.

                     Sharpness -> (integer)
                        Changes the strength of the anti-alias filter used for
                        scaling.  0  is  the  softest  setting,  100  is   the
                        sharpest. A setting of 50 is recommended for most con-
                        tent.

                     Width -> (integer)
                        Output video width, in pixels. Must be an even number.
                        For  most  codecs, you can leave this field and height
                        blank in order to use the height  and  width  (resolu-
                        tion)  from  the  source.  Note, however, that leaving
                        blank is not recommended. For the Frame Capture codec,
                        height and width are required.

          Id -> (string)
              The unique id of the channel.

          InputAttachments -> (list)
              List of input attachments for channel.

                 AutomaticInputFailoverSettings -> (structure)
                     User-specified  settings for defining what the conditions
                     are for declaring the input unhealthy and failing over to
                     a different input.

                     ErrorClearTimeMsec -> (integer)
                        This  clear  time  defines the requirement a recovered
                        input must meet to be considered  healthy.  The  input
                        must  have  no  failover conditions for this length of
                        time. Enter a time in milliseconds. This value is par-
                        ticularly  important  if  the input_preference for the
                        failover pair is set to  PRIMARY_INPUT_PREFERRED,  be-
                        cause  after  this time, MediaLive will switch back to
                        the primary input.

                     FailoverConditions -> (list)
                        A list of failover conditions. If any of these  condi-
                        tions  occur, MediaLive will perform a failover to the
                        other input.

                        (structure)
                            Failover Condition settings. There can be multiple
                            failover conditions inside AutomaticInputFailover-
                            Settings.

                            FailoverConditionSettings -> (structure)
                               Failover condition type-specific settings.

                               AudioSilenceSettings -> (structure)
                                   MediaLive will perform a  failover  if  the
                                   specified  audio selector is silent for the
                                   specified period.

                                   AudioSelectorName -> (string)
                                      The name of the audio  selector  in  the
                                      input  that  MediaLive should monitor to
                                      detect silence. Select your most  impor-
                                      tant  rendition. If you didn't create an
                                      audio  selector  in  this  input,  leave
                                      blank.

                                   AudioSilenceThresholdMsec -> (integer)
                                      The  amount  of  time  (in milliseconds)
                                      that the active input must be silent be-
                                      fore  automatic  input  failover occurs.
                                      Silence is defined as audio loss or  au-
                                      dio quieter than -50 dBFS.

                               InputLossSettings -> (structure)
                                   MediaLive  will  perform a failover if con-
                                   tent is not detected in this input for  the
                                   specified period.

                                   InputLossThresholdMsec -> (integer)
                                      The  amount  of  time  (in milliseconds)
                                      that no input is  detected.  After  that
                                      time, an input failover will occur.

                               VideoBlackSettings -> (structure)
                                   MediaLive  will  perform a failover if con-
                                   tent is considered black for the  specified
                                   period.

                                   BlackDetectThreshold -> (double)
                                      A  value used in calculating the thresh-
                                      old below which  MediaLive  considers  a
                                      pixel to be 'black'. For the input to be
                                      considered black, every pixel in a frame
                                      must   be   below  this  threshold.  The
                                      threshold is calculated as a  percentage
                                      (expressed   as  a  decimal)  of  white.
                                      Therefore .1 means  10%  white  (or  90%
                                      black).  Note  how the formula works for
                                      any color depth. For example, if you set
                                      this field to 0.1 in 10-bit color depth:
                                      (1023*0.1=102.3), which  means  a  pixel
                                      value  of 102 or less is 'black'. If you
                                      set this field to .1 in an  8-bit  color
                                      depth:  (255*0.1=25.5),  which  means  a
                                      pixel value of 25 or  less  is  'black'.
                                      The range is 0.0 to 1.0, with any number
                                      of decimal places.

                                   VideoBlackThresholdMsec -> (integer)
                                      The amount  of  time  (in  milliseconds)
                                      that  the active input must be black be-
                                      fore automatic input failover occurs.

                     InputPreference -> (string)
                        Input preference when deciding which input to make ac-
                        tive when a previously failed input has recovered.

                     SecondaryInputId -> (string)
                        The  input  ID of the secondary input in the automatic
                        input failover pair.

                 InputAttachmentName -> (string)
                     User-specified name for the attachment. This is  required
                     if  the  user  wants to use this input in an input switch
                     action.

                 InputId -> (string)
                     The ID of the input

                 InputSettings -> (structure)
                     Settings of an input (caption selector, etc.)

                     AudioSelectors -> (list)
                        Used to select the audio stream to decode  for  inputs
                        that have multiple available.

                        (structure)
                            Audio Selector

                            Name -> (string)
                               The  name  of this AudioSelector. AudioDescrip-
                               tions will use this name to  uniquely  identify
                               this  Selector. Selector names should be unique
                               per input.

                            SelectorSettings -> (structure)

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      Specifies the NAME in  the  #EXT-X-MEDIA
                                      tag of the target HLS audio rendition.

                               AudioLanguageSelection -> (structure)
                                   Audio Language Selection

                                   LanguageCode -> (string)
                                      Selects a specific three-letter language
                                      code from within an audio source.

                                   LanguageSelectionPolicy -> (string)
                                      When  set  to  "strict",  the  transport
                                      stream  demux  strictly identifies audio
                                      streams by their language descriptor. If
                                      a  PMT  update occurs such that an audio
                                      stream matching the  initially  selected
                                      language  is no longer present then mute
                                      will be encoded until the  language  re-
                                      turns.  If "loose", then on a PMT update
                                      the  demux  will  choose  another  audio
                                      stream  in  the  program  with  the same
                                      stream type if it can't  find  one  with
                                      the same language.

                               AudioPidSelection -> (structure)
                                   Audio Pid Selection

                                      Height -> (double)
                                          See the description  in  leftOffset.
                                          For   height,   specify  the  entire
                                          height of the rectangle  as  a  per-
                                          centage   of  the  underlying  frame
                                          height. For example, "80" means  the
                                          rectangle  height  is 80% of the un-
                                          derlying frame height. The topOffset
                                          and  rectangleHeight  must add up to
                                          100% or less. This field corresponds
                                          to  tts:extent - Y in the TTML stan-

                                      LeftOffset -> (double)
                                          Applies only if you plan to  convert
                                          these source captions to EBU-TT-D or
                                          TTML in an  output.  (Make  sure  to
                                          leave  the default if you don't have
                                          either of these formats in the  out-
                                          put.)  You can define a display rec-
                                          tangle  for  the  captions  that  is
                                          smaller  than  the  underlying video
                                          frame. You define the  rectangle  by
                                          specifying  the position of the left
                                          edge, top  edge,  bottom  edge,  and
                                          right  edge  of  the  rectangle, all
                                          within the underlying  video  frame.
                                          The  units  for the measurements are
                                          percentages. If you specify a  value
                                          for  one  of  these fields, you must
                                          specify a value for all of them. For
                                          leftOffset,  specify the position of
                                          the left edge of the rectangle, as a
                                          percentage  of  the underlying frame
                                          width, and relative to the left edge
                                          of  the  frame.  For  example,  "10"
                                          means the measurement is 10% of  the
                                          underlying  frame width. The rectan-
                                          gle left edge starts at  that  posi-
                                          tion  from  the  left  edge  of  the
                                          frame.  This  field  corresponds  to
                                          tts:origin - X in the TTML standard.

                                      TopOffset -> (double)
                                          See  the  description in leftOffset.
                                          For topOffset, specify the  position
                                          of the top edge of the rectangle, as
                                          a percentage of the underlying frame
                                          height, and relative to the top edge
                                          of  the  frame.  For  example,  "10"
                                          means  the measurement is 10% of the
                                          underlying frame height. The rectan-
                                          gle top edge starts at that position
                                          from the top edge of the frame. This
                                          field  corresponds to tts:origin - Y

                                          See the description  in  leftOffset.
                                          For  width, specify the entire width
                                          of the rectangle as a percentage  of
                                          the  underlying frame width. For ex-
                                          ample,  "80"  means  the   rectangle
                                          width is 80% of the underlying frame
                                          width. The  leftOffset  and  rectan-
                                          gleWidth  must  add  up  to  100% or
                                          less.  This  field  corresponds   to

                               will be chosen, otherwise the highest bandwidth
                               stream in the m3u8 will be chosen. The  bitrate
                               is  specified  in bits per second, as in an HLS
                               manifest.

                            BufferSegments -> (integer)
                               When specified, reading of the HLS  input  will
                               begin  this  many  buffer segments from the end
                               (most recently written segment). When not spec-
                               ified,  the HLS input will begin with the first
                               segment specified in the m3u8.

                               Identifies  the source for the SCTE-35 messages
                               that MediaLive will ingest. Messages can be in-
                               gested   from  the  content  segments  (in  the
                               stream) or from tags in the playlist  (the  HLS
                               manifest).  MediaLive  ignores SCTE-35 informa-
                               tion in the source that is not selected.

                        ServerValidation -> (string)
                            Check  HTTPS  server  certificates.  When  set  to

                            tificate will be checked,  but  not  the  server's
                            name.  Certain subdomains (notably S3 buckets that
                            use dots in the bucket name) do not strictly match
                            the  corresponding  certificate's wildcard pattern
                            and would otherwise cause the event to error. This
                            setting  is  ignored for protocols that do not use
                            https.

                        from  a  SMPTE-2038  source  in this input. Applicable
                        data types are captions, timecode, AFD,  and  SCTE-104
                        messages. - PREFER: Extract from SMPTE-2038 if present
                        in this input, otherwise extract from  another  source
                        (if  any).  - IGNORE: Never extract any ancillary data
                        from SMPTE-2038.

                     SourceEndBehavior -> (string)
                        Loop input if it is a file. This allows a  file  input

                            Specifies the color space of an input.  This  set-
                            ting  works  in  tandem with colorSpaceUsage and a
                            video  description's  colorSpaceSettingsChoice  to
                            determine if any conversion will be performed.

                                   erage light level, in nits, for any  single
                                   frame within an encoded HDR video stream or
                                   file.

                        ColorSpaceUsage -> (string)
                            Applies only if colorSpace is a value  other  than
                            follow.  This  field controls how the value in the
                            colorSpace field will be used. fallback means that
                            when the input does include color space data, that
                            data will be used, but when the input has no color
                            space  data, the value in colorSpace will be used.
                            Choose fallback if your input is sometimes missing
                            color  space  data,  but  when  it does have color
                            space data, that data is correct. force  means  to
                            always  use  the value in colorSpace. Choose force
                            if your input usually has no color space  data  or
                            might have unreliable color space data.
