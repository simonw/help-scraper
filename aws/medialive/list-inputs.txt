NAME
       list-inputs -

DESCRIPTION
       Produces list of inputs that have been created

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-inputs  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Inputs

SYNOPSIS
            list-inputs
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 A  list  of  channel IDs that that input is attached to (cur-
                 rently an input can only be attached to one channel).

                 (string)
                     Placeholder documentation for __string

              Destinations -> (list)

                     The settings for a PUSH type input.

                     Ip -> (string)
                        The system-generated static IP address of endpoint. It
                        remains fixed for the lifetime of the input.

                     Port -> (string)
                        The port number for the input.

                     Url -> (string)
                        This  represents the endpoint that the customer stream
                        will be pushed to.

                     Vpc -> (structure)
                        The properties for a VPC type input destination.

                        AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                            The availability zone of the Input destination.

                        NetworkInterfaceId -> (string)
                            The network interface ID of the Input  destination
                            in the VPC.

              Id -> (string)
                 The  generated  ID of the input (unique for user account, im-
                 mutable).

              InputClass -> (string)
                 STANDARD - MediaLive expects two sources to be  connected  to
                 this  input.  If  the  channel is also STANDARD, both sources
                 will be ingested. If the channel is SINGLE_PIPELINE, only the
                 first  source will be ingested; the second source will always
                 be ignored, even if the first source fails. SINGLE_PIPELINE -
                 You  can  connect only one source to this input. If the Chan-
                 nelClass is also SINGLE_PIPELINE, this value is valid. If the
                 ChannelClass is STANDARD, this value is not valid because the
                 channel requires two sources in the input.

              InputDevices -> (list)
                 Settings for the input devices.

                     Id -> (string)
                        The unique ID for the device.

                 Certain pull input sources can be dynamic, meaning that  they
                 can  have their URL's dynamically changes during input switch
                 actions.  Presently,  this  functionality  only  works   with
