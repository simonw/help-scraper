OPTIONS
       --channel-id  (string)  Id  of  the channel whose schedule is being up-
       dated.

       --creates (structure) Schedule actions to create in the schedule.Sched-
       uleActions -> (list)
          A list of schedule actions to create.

          (structure)
              Contains information on a single schedule action.

              ActionName -> (string)
                 The  name  of the action, must be unique within the schedule.
                 This name provides the main reference to an action once it is
                 added to the schedule. A name is unique if it is no longer in
                 the schedule. The schedule is automatically cleaned up to re-
                 move  actions  with a start time of more than 1 hour ago (ap-
                 proximately) so at that point a name can be reused.

              ScheduleActionSettings -> (structure)
                 Settings for this schedule action.

                        The duration in milliseconds for the image  to  remain
                        on  the  video. If omitted or set to 0 the duration is
                        unlimited and the image will remain until  it  is  ex-
                        plicitly deactivated.

                     FadeIn -> (integer)
                        The time in milliseconds for the image to fade in. The
                        fade-in starts at the start time of the  overlay.  De-

                        milliseconds for the image to fade out.  The  fade-out
                        starts  when  the  duration  time is hit, so it effec-
                        tively  extends  the  duration.  Default  is   0   (no
                        fade-out).

                        The  height of the image when inserted into the video,
                        in pixels. The overlay will be scaled up  or  down  to
                        the  specified  height.  Leave blank to use the native
                        height of the overlay.

                        Uri -> (string)
                            Uniform Resource Identifier -  This  should  be  a
                            path  to a file accessible to the Live system (eg.
                            a http:// URI) depending on the output  type.  For
                            example, a RTMP destination should have a uri sim-
                            liar to: "rtmp://fmsserver/live".

                        the  left  edge  of the video frame, in pixels. 0 (the
                        default) is the left edge of the frame. If the  place-
                        ment  causes  the  overlay  to extend beyond the right
                        edge of the underlying  video,  then  the  overlay  is
                        cropped on the right.

                     ImageY -> (integer)
                        Placement  of  the top edge of the overlay relative to
                        the top edge of the video frame, in pixels. 0 (the de-
                        fault)  is the top edge of the frame. If the placement
                        causes the overlay to extend beyond the bottom edge of
                        the  underlying  video, then the overlay is cropped on
                        the bottom.

                     Layer -> (integer)
                        The number of the layer, 0 to 7. There  are  8  layers

                        different image. The layers  are  in  Z  order,  which
                        means  that  overlays  with higher values of layer are
                        inserted on top  of  overlays  with  lower  values  of
                        layer. Default is 0.

                     Opacity -> (integer)
                        Opacity  of  image  where  0 is transparent and 100 is
                        fully opaque. Default is 100.

                     Width -> (integer)
                        The width of the image when inserted into  the  video,
                        in  pixels.  The  overlay will be scaled up or down to
                        the specified width. Leave blank  to  use  the  native
                        width of the overlay.

                 StaticImageDeactivateSettings -> (structure)
                     Action to deactivate a static image overlay

                     FadeOut -> (integer)
                        The  time  in  milliseconds for the image to fade out.
                        Default is 0 (no fade-out).

                     Layer -> (integer)
                        The image overlay layer to deactivate, 0 to 7. Default
                        is 0.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ActionNames=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ActionNames": ["string", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                     once  it is added to the schedule. A name is unique if it
                     is no longer in the schedule. The schedule  is  automati-
                     cally  cleaned  up to remove actions with a start time of
                     more than 1 hour ago (approximately) so at that  point  a
                     name can be reused.

                            with a different image. The layers are in Z order,
                            which  means  that  overlays with higher values of
                            layer are inserted on top of overlays  with  lower

                            time.  If  you  do  not  enter  a  duration,   the
                            splice_insert will continue indefinitely and there
                            is an  expectation  that  you  will  enter  a  re-

                            (the default) is the left edge of  the  frame.  If
                            the  placement causes the overlay to extend beyond
                            the right edge of the underlying video,  then  the
                            overlay is cropped on the right.

                            (the default) is the top edge of the frame. If the
                            placement causes the overlay to extend beyond  the
                            bottom  edge  of  the  underlying  video, then the
                            overlay is cropped on the bottom.

                            with a different image. The layers are in Z order,
                            which  means  that  overlays with higher values of
                            layer are inserted on top of overlays  with  lower
                            values of layer. Default is 0.

                        Opacity -> (integer)
