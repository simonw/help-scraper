LIST-CHANNELS()                                                LIST-CHANNELS()



NAME
       list-channels -

DESCRIPTION
       Produces list of channels that have been created

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-channels  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Channels

SYNOPSIS
            list-channels
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              Destinations -> (list)
                 A list of destinations of the channel. For UDP outputs, there
                 is one destination per output. For other types (HLS, for  ex-
                 ample), there is one destination per packager.

                               need to specify the individual inputs in Media-
                               Package; MediaLive will handle  the  connection
                               of the two MediaLive pipelines to the two Medi-
                               aPackage inputs. The MediaPackage  channel  and
                               MediaLive channel must be in the same region.

                     MultiplexSettings -> (structure)
                        Destination  settings for a Multiplex output; one des-

                        MultiplexId -> (string)
                            The ID of the Multiplex that the encoder  is  pro-
                            viding  output  to. You do not need to specify the
                            individual inputs to the Multiplex; MediaLive will
                            handle  the  connection of the two MediaLive pipe-
                            lines to the two Multiplex instances.  The  Multi-
                            plex must be in the same region as the Channel.

                        ProgramName -> (string)
                            The program name of the Multiplex program that the

                               rameter store

                            StreamName -> (string)
                               Stream name for RTMP destinations (URLs of type
                               rtmp://)

                            Url -> (string)

                     SourceIp -> (string)
                        Public IP of where a channel's output comes from

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique id of the channel.

              InputAttachments -> (list)
                 List of input attachments for channel.

                     AutomaticInputFailoverSettings -> (structure)
                        User-specified settings for defining what  the  condi-
                        tions  are for declaring the input unhealthy and fail-
                        ing over to a different input.

                        ErrorClearTimeMsec -> (integer)
                            This clear time defines the requirement  a  recov-
                            ered input must meet to be considered healthy. The
                            input must have no failover  conditions  for  this
                            length of time. Enter a time in milliseconds. This
                            value is particularly important if the input_pref-
                            erence for the failover pair is set to PRIMARY_IN-
                            PUT_PREFERRED, because after this time,  MediaLive
                            will switch back to the primary input.

                        FailoverConditions -> (list)
                            A  list  of  failover  conditions. If any of these
                            conditions  occur,  MediaLive   will   perform   a
                            failover to the other input.

                            (structure)
                               Failover  Condition settings. There can be mul-
                               tiple failover conditions  inside  AutomaticIn-
                               putFailoverSettings.

                               FailoverConditionSettings -> (structure)
                                   Failover condition type-specific settings.

                                   AudioSilenceSettings -> (structure)
                                      MediaLive will perform a failover if the
                                      specified audio selector is  silent  for
                                      the specified period.

                                      AudioSelectorName -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the audio selector in
                                          the input that MediaLive should mon-
                                          itor  to detect silence. Select your
                                          most  important  rendition.  If  you
                                          didn't  create  an audio selector in
                                          this input, leave blank.

                                      AudioSilenceThresholdMsec -> (integer)
                                          The amount of time (in milliseconds)
                                          that the active input must be silent
                                          before automatic input failover  oc-
                                          curs.  Silence  is  defined as audio
                                          loss or audio quieter than -50 dBFS.

                                   InputLossSettings -> (structure)
                                      MediaLive will  perform  a  failover  if
                                      content  is  not  detected in this input
                                      for the specified period.

                                      InputLossThresholdMsec -> (integer)
                                          The amount of time (in milliseconds)
                                          that  no  input  is  detected. After
                                          that time, an  input  failover  will
                                          occur.

                                   VideoBlackSettings -> (structure)
                                      MediaLive  will  perform  a  failover if
                                      content  is  considered  black  for  the
                                      specified period.

                                      BlackDetectThreshold -> (double)
                                          A  value  used  in  calculating  the
                                          threshold below which MediaLive con-
                                          siders  a  pixel  to be 'black'. For
                                          the input to  be  considered  black,
                                          every pixel in a frame must be below
                                          this  threshold.  The  threshold  is
                                          calculated   as  a  percentage  (ex-
                                          pressed  as  a  decimal)  of  white.
                                          Therefore .1 means 10% white (or 90%
                                          black). Note how the  formula  works
                                          for any color depth. For example, if
                                          you set this field to 0.1 in  10-bit
                                          color depth: (1023*0.1=102.3), which
                                          means a pixel value of 102  or  less
                                          is 'black'. If you set this field to
                                          .1  in   an   8-bit   color   depth:
                                          (255*0.1=25.5),  which means a pixel
                                          value of 25 or less is 'black'.  The
                                          range is 0.0 to 1.0, with any number
                                          of decimal places.

                                      VideoBlackThresholdMsec -> (integer)
                                          The amount of time (in milliseconds)
                                          that  the active input must be black
                                          before automatic input failover  oc-
                                          curs.

                        InputPreference -> (string)
                            Input preference when deciding which input to make
                            active when a previously failed input  has  recov-
                            ered.

                        SecondaryInputId -> (string)
                            The  input  ID of the secondary input in the auto-
                            matic input failover pair.

                     InputAttachmentName -> (string)
                        User-specified name for the attachment.  This  is  re-
                        quired if the user wants to use this input in an input
                        switch action.

                     InputId -> (string)
                        The ID of the input

                     InputSettings -> (structure)
                        Settings of an input (caption selector, etc.)

                        AudioSelectors -> (list)
                            Used to select the audio stream to decode for  in-
                            puts that have multiple available.

                            (structure)
                               Audio Selector

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The  name  of  this AudioSelector. AudioDe-
                                   scriptions will use this name  to  uniquely

                                             means the rectangle height is 80%
                                             of the underlying  frame  height.

                                             frame. The units for the measure-
                                             ments  are  percentages.  If  you
                                             specify a value for one of  these
                                             fields,  you must specify a value
                                             for all of them. For  leftOffset,
                                             specify  the position of the left
                                             edge of the rectangle, as a  per-

                                             edge  of  the frame. For example,
                                             "10" means the measurement is 10%
                                             of  the  underlying  frame width.
                                             The rectangle left edge starts at
                                             that  position from the left edge
                                             of the frame. This  field  corre-

                               than follow. This field controls how the  value
                               in  the colorSpace field will be used. fallback
                               means that when the input  does  include  color
                               space  data,  that  data will be used, but when
                               the input has no color space data, the value in
                               colorSpace  will  be  used.  Choose fallback if
                               your input is  sometimes  missing  color  space
                               data,  but  when it does have color space data,
                               that data is correct. force means to always use
                               the  value  in colorSpace. Choose force if your
                               input usually has no color space data or  might
                               have unreliable color space data.
