TAG-RESOURCES()                                                TAG-RESOURCES()



NAME
       tag-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Applies  one  or more tags to the specified resources. Note the follow-
       ing:

       o Not all resources can have tags. For a  list  of  services  with  re-
         sources  that support tagging using this operation, see Services that
         support the Resource Groups Tagging API . If the resource doesn't yet
         support  this operation, the resource's service might support tagging
         using its own API operations. For more information, refer to the doc-
         umentation for that service.

       o Each  resource can have up to 50 tags. For other limits, see Tag Nam-
         ing and Usage Conventions in the Amazon Web Services  General  Refer-
         ence.

       o You  can  only tag resources that are located in the specified Amazon
         Web Services Region for the Amazon Web Services account.

       o To add tags to a resource, you need the necessary permissions for the
         service  that  the  resource  belongs  to  as well as permissions for
         adding tags. For more information, see  the  documentation  for  each
         service.

       WARNING:
              Do  not store personally identifiable information (PII) or other
              confidential or sensitive information in tags. We  use  tags  to
              provide  you  with billing and administration services. Tags are
              not intended to be used for private or sensitive data.

          Minimum permissions

       In addition to the tag:TagResources permission required by this  opera-
       tion,  you must also have the tagging permission defined by the service
       that created the resource. For example, to tag an Amazon  EC2  instance
       using  the  TagResources operation, you must have both of the following
       permissions:

       o tag:TagResource

       o ec2:CreateTags

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            tag-resources
          --resource-arn-list <value>
          --tags <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn-list (list)
          Specifies the list of ARNs of the resources that you want  to  apply
          tags to.

          An  ARN  (Amazon  Resource Name) uniquely identifies a resource. For
          more information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)  and  Amazon  Web
          Services  Service Namespaces in the Amazon Web Services General Ref-
          erence .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (map)
          Specifies a list of tags that you want to add to the  specified  re-
          sources. A tag consists of a key and a value that you define.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To attach a tag to a resource

       The  following tag-resources example tags the specified resource with a
       key name and value.

          aws resourcegroupstaggingapi tag-resources \
              --resource-arn-list arn:aws:s3:::MyProductionBucket \
              --tags Environment=Production,CostCenter=1234

       Output:

          {
              "FailedResourcesMap": {}
          }

       For more information, see TagResources in the Resource  Groups  Tagging
       API Reference.

OUTPUT
       FailedResourcesMap -> (map)
          A map containing a key-value pair for each failed item that couldn't
          be tagged. The key is the ARN of the failed resource. The value is a
          FailureInfo  object  that contains an error code, a status code, and
          an error message. If there are no errors, the FailedResourcesMap  is
          empty.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Information  about  the errors that are returned for each failed
              resource. This information can include  InternalServiceException
              and  InvalidParameterException  errors.  It can also include any
              valid error code returned by the  Amazon  Web  Services  service
              that hosts the resource that the ARN key represents.

              The following are common error codes that you might receive from
              other Amazon Web Services services:

              o InternalServiceException  This  can  mean  that  the  Resource
                Groups Tagging API didn't receive a response from another Ama-
                zon Web Services service. It can also mean that  the  resource
                type  in  the  request is not supported by the Resource Groups
                Tagging API. In these cases, it's safe to  retry  the  request
                and then call GetResources to verify the changes.

              o AccessDeniedException   This can mean that you need permission
                to call the tagging operations in the Amazon Web Services ser-
                vice  that  contains the resource. For example, to use the Re-
                source Groups Tagging API to tag a Amazon CloudWatch alarm re-
                source,  you  need  permission  to  call  both  ` TagResources
                https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/API_TagResources.html`__
                and                        `                       TagResource
                https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html`__
                in the CloudWatch API.

              For  more  information  on  errors that are generated from other
              Amazon Web Services services, see  the  documentation  for  that
              service.

              StatusCode -> (integer)
                 The HTTP status code of the common error.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The  code  of  the  common error. Valid values include Inter-
                 nalServiceException ,  InvalidParameterException  ,  and  any
                 valid  error code returned by the Amazon Web Services service
                 that hosts the resource that you want to tag.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 The message of the common error.
