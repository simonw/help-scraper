DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified fraudster registration job.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-fraudster-registration-job
          --domain-id <value>
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-id (string)
          The  identifier for the domain containing the fraudster registration
          job.

       --job-id (string)
          The identifier for the fraudster registration job you  are  describ-
          ing.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp showing the creation time of the fraudster registra-
              tion job.

          DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The  IAM  role  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that grants Voice ID
              permissions to access customer's buckets to read the input mani-
              fest file and write the job output file.

          DomainId -> (string)
              The  identifier of the domain containing the fraudster registra-
              tion job.

          FailureDetails -> (structure)
              Contains details that are populated when  an  entire  batch  job
              fails.  In  cases  of  individual registration job failures, the
              batch job as a whole doesn't fail; it is completed with  a  Job-
              Status  of  COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS  .  You can use the job output
              file to  identify  the  individual  registration  requests  that
              failed.

              Message -> (string)
                 A description of the error that caused the batch job failure.

              StatusCode -> (integer)
                 An HTTP status code representing the nature of the error.

          InputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The  input  data config containing an S3 URI for the input mani-
              fest file that contains the list of fraudster  registration  job
              requests.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The S3 location for the input manifest file that contains the
                 list of individual enrollment or registration job requests.

          JobId -> (string)
              The service-generated identifier for the fraudster  registration
              job.

          JobName -> (string)
              The client-provied name for the fraudster registration job.

          JobProgress -> (structure)
              Shows  the  completed percentage of registration requests listed
              in the input file.

              PercentComplete -> (integer)
                 Shows the completed percentage of enrollment or  registration
                 requests listed in the input file.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the fraudster registration job.

          OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The output data config containing the S3 location where you want
              Voice ID to write your job output file; you must also include  a
              KMS Key ID in order to encrypt the file.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 the identifier of the KMS key you want Voice ID to use to en-
                 crypt the output file of the fraudster registration job.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The S3 path of the folder to which Voice ID  writes  the  job
                 output file, which has a *.out extension. For example, if the
                 input file name is input-file.json and the output folder path
                 is  s3://output-bucket/output-folder  ,  the full output file
                 path      is      s3://output-bucket/output-folder/job-Id/in-
                 put-file.json.out .

          RegistrationConfig -> (structure)
              The registration config containing details such as the action to
              take when a duplicate fraudster is detected, and the  similarity
              threshold to use for detecting a duplicate fraudster.

              DuplicateRegistrationAction -> (string)
                 The action to take when a fraudster is identified as a dupli-
                 cate. The default action is SKIP ,  which  skips  registering
                 the duplicate fraudster. Setting the value to REGISTER_AS_NEW
                 always registers a new fraudster into the specified domain.

              FraudsterSimilarityThreshold -> (integer)
                 The minimum similarity score between the new and  old  fraud-
                 sters in order to consider the new fraudster a duplicate.
