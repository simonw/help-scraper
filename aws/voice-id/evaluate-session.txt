OPTIONS
       --domain-id (string)
          The identifier of the domain where the session started.

       --session-name-or-id (string)
          The session identifier, or name of the session,  that  you  want  to
          evaluate. In Voice ID integration, this is the Contact-Id.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       AuthenticationResult -> (structure)
          Details resulting from the authentication process, such as authenti-
          cation decision and authentication score.

          AudioAggregationEndedAt -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp indicating when audio aggregation ended for this au-
              thentication result.

          AudioAggregationStartedAt -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp indicating when audio aggregation started  for  this
              authentication result.

          AuthenticationResultId -> (string)
              The  unique  identifier  for this authentication result. Because
              there can be multiple authentications for a given session,  this
              field  helps to identify if the returned result is from a previ-
              ous streaming activity or a new result. Note that in absence  of
              any  new  streaming  activity,  AcceptanceThreshold  changes, or
              SpeakerId changes, Voice ID always returns cached Authentication
              Result for this API.

          Configuration -> (structure)
              The  AuthenticationConfiguration used to generate this authenti-
              cation result.

              AcceptanceThreshold -> (integer)
                 The minimum threshold needed to successfully  authenticate  a
                 speaker.

          CustomerSpeakerId -> (string)
              The client-provided identifier for the speaker whose authentica-
              tion result is produced. Only present if a SpeakerId is provided
              for the session.

          Decision -> (string)
              The  authentication  decision  produced  by  Voice ID, processed
              against the current session state  and  streamed  audio  of  the
              speaker.

          GeneratedSpeakerId -> (string)
              The service-generated identifier for the speaker whose authenti-
              cation result is produced.

          Score -> (integer)
              The authentication score for the  speaker  whose  authentication
              result  is produced. This value is only present if the authenti-
              cation decision is either ACCEPT or REJECT .

       DomainId -> (string)
          The identifier of the domain containing the session.

       FraudDetectionResult -> (structure)
          Details resulting from the fraud detection process,  such  as  fraud
          detection decision and risk score.

          AudioAggregationEndedAt -> (timestamp)
              A  timestamp  indicating  when  audio aggregation ended for this
              fraud detection result.

          AudioAggregationStartedAt -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp indicating when audio aggregation started  for  this
              fraud detection result.

          Configuration -> (structure)
              The  FraudDetectionConfiguration used to generate this fraud de-
              tection result.

              RiskThreshold -> (integer)
                 Threshold value for determining  whether  the  speaker  is  a
                 fraudster.  If the detected risk score calculated by Voice ID
                 is higher than the threshold, the  speaker  is  considered  a
                 fraudster.

          Decision -> (string)
              The  fraud  detection  decision  produced by Voice ID, processed
              against the current session state  and  streamed  audio  of  the
              speaker.

          FraudDetectionResultId -> (string)
              The  unique  identifier  for  this fraud detection result. Given
              there can be multiple fraud detections for a given session, this
              field helps in identifying if the returned result is from previ-
              ous streaming activity or a new result. Note that in the absence
              of  any  new streaming activity or risk threshold changes, Voice
              ID always returns cached Fraud Detection result for this API.

          Reasons -> (list)
              The reason speaker was flagged by the  fraud  detection  system.
              This  is  only  be  populated  if  fraud  detection  Decision is
              HIGH_RISK , and only has one possible value: KNOWN_FRAUDSTER .

              (string)

          RiskDetails -> (structure)
              Details about each risk analyzed for this speaker.

              KnownFraudsterRisk -> (structure)
                 The details resulting from 'Known Fraudster Risk' analysis of
                 the speaker.

                 GeneratedFraudsterId -> (string)
                     The identifier of the fraudster that is the closest match
                     to the speaker. If there are no fraudsters registered  in
                     a  given  domain,  or  if  there are no fraudsters with a
                     non-zero RiskScore, this value is null .

                 RiskScore -> (integer)
                     The score indicating the  likelihood  the  speaker  is  a
                     known fraudster.

       SessionId -> (string)
          The service-generated identifier of the session.

       SessionName -> (string)
          The client-provided name of the session.

       StreamingStatus -> (string)
          The  current  status of audio streaming for this session. This field
          is useful to infer next steps when the Authentication or  Fraud  De-
          tection  results are empty or the decision is NOT_ENOUGH_SPEECH . In
          this situation, if the StreamingStatus is ONGOING/PENDING_CONFIGURA-
          TION  , it can mean that the client should call the API again later,
          after Voice ID has enough audio to produce a result. If the decision
          remains  NOT_ENOUGH_SPEECH  even after StreamingStatus is ENDED , it
          means that the previously  streamed  session  did  not  have  enough
          speech  to perform evaluation, and a new streaming session is needed
          to try again.
