DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified speaker enrollment job.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-speaker-enrollment-job
          --domain-id <value>
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-id (string)
          The identifier of the domain containing the speaker enrollment job.

       --job-id (string)
          The identifier of the speaker enrollment job you are describing.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Job -> (structure)
          Contains details about the specified speaker enrollment job.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp showing the creation of the speaker enrollment job.

          DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The IAM role Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  that  grants  Voice  ID
              permissions to access customer's buckets to read the input mani-
              fest file and write the job output file.

          DomainId -> (string)
              The identifier of the domain that contains the  speaker  enroll-
              ment job.

          EndedAt -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp showing when the speaker enrollment job ended.

          EnrollmentConfig -> (structure)
              The  configuration  that  defines  the  action  to take when the
              speaker is already enrolled in Voice ID, and the FraudDetection-
              Config to use.

              ExistingEnrollmentAction -> (string)
                 The  action to take when the specified speaker is already en-
                 rolled in the specified domain. The default value is  SKIP  ,
                 which  skips the enrollment for the existing speaker. Setting
                 the value to OVERWRITE replaces the existing voice prints and
                 enrollment audio stored for that speaker with new data gener-
                 ated from the latest audio.

              FraudDetectionConfig -> (structure)
                 The fraud detection configuration to use for the speaker  en-
                 rollment job.

                 FraudDetectionAction -> (string)
                     The  action  to take when the given speaker is flagged by
                     the fraud detection system. The default value is  FAIL  ,
                     which  fails  the speaker enrollment. Changing this value
                     to IGNORE results in the speaker being enrolled  even  if
                     they are flagged by the fraud detection system.

                 RiskThreshold -> (integer)
                     Threshold  value for determining whether the speaker is a
                     high risk to be fraudulent. If the  detected  risk  score
                     calculated  by  Voice  ID is greater than or equal to the
                     threshold, the speaker is considered a fraudster.

          FailureDetails -> (structure)
              Contains details that are populated when  an  entire  batch  job
              fails.  In  cases  of  individual registration job failures, the
              batch job as a whole doesn't fail; it is completed with  a  Job-
              Status  of  COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS  .  You can use the job output
              file to  identify  the  individual  registration  requests  that
              failed.

              Message -> (string)
                 A description of the error that caused the batch job failure.

              StatusCode -> (integer)
                 An HTTP status code representing the nature of the error.

          InputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The  input  data config containing an S3 URI for the input mani-
              fest file that contains the list of speaker enrollment  job  re-
              quests.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The S3 location for the input manifest file that contains the
                 list of individual enrollment or registration job requests.

          JobId -> (string)
              The service-generated identifier for the speaker enrollment job.

          JobName -> (string)
              The client-provided name for the speaker enrollment job.

          JobProgress -> (structure)
              Provides details on job progress. This field shows the completed
              percentage of registration requests listed in the input file.

              PercentComplete -> (integer)
                 Shows  the completed percentage of enrollment or registration
                 requests listed in the input file.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the speaker enrollment job.

          OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The output data config containing the S3 location where Voice ID
              writes  the  job output file; you must also include a KMS Key ID
              to encrypt the file.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 the identifier of the KMS key you want Voice ID to use to en-
                 crypt the output file of the fraudster registration job.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The  S3  path  of the folder to which Voice ID writes the job
                 output file, which has a *.out extension. For example, if the
                 input file name is input-file.json and the output folder path
                 is s3://output-bucket/output-folder , the  full  output  file
                 path      is      s3://output-bucket/output-folder/job-Id/in-
                 put-file.json.out .
