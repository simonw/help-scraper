SYNOPSIS
            list-speaker-enrollment-jobs
          --domain-id <value>
          [--job-status <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-id (string)
          The identifier of the domain containing the speaker enrollment jobs.

       --job-status (string)
          Provides the status of your speaker enrollment Job.

          Possible values:

          o SUBMITTED

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o COMPLETED

          o COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS

          o FAILED

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of results that are returned per call. You can
          use NextToken to obtain further pages of  results.  The  default  is
          100; the maximum allowed page size is also 100.

       --next-token (string)
          If  NextToken  is  returned,  there  are more results available. The
          value of NextToken is a unique pagination token for each page.  Make
          the  call  again using the returned token to retrieve the next page.
          Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each  pagination  token  expires
          after 24 hours.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       JobSummaries -> (list)
          A  list  containing  details about each specified speaker enrollment
          job.

          (structure)
              Contains a summary of information  about  a  speaker  enrollment
              job.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 A  timestamp showing the creation time of the speaker enroll-
                 ment job.

              DomainId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the domain that contains  the  speaker  en-

              EndedAt -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp showing when the speaker enrollment job ended.

                 Contains  details that are populated when an entire batch job
                 fails. In cases of individual registration job failures,  the
                 batch  job  as  a  whole doesn't fail; it is completed with a
                 JobStatus of COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS . You can use the job out-
                 put  file  to  identify  the individual registration requests
                 that failed.

                 Message -> (string)
                     A description of the error  that  caused  the  batch  job
                     failure.

                     An HTTP status code representing the nature of the error.

              JobId -> (string)
                 The  service-generated  identifier for the speaker enrollment
                 job.

              JobName -> (string)
                 The client-provided name for the speaker enrollment job.

              JobProgress -> (structure)
                 Provides details regarding job progress. This field shows the
                 completed percentage of enrollment requests listed in the in-
                 put file.

                 PercentComplete -> (integer)
                     Shows the completed percentage of enrollment or registra-
                     tion requests listed in the input file.

              JobStatus -> (string)
                 The current status of the speaker enrollment job.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  NextToken  is  returned,  there  are more results available. The
          value of NextToken is a unique pagination token for each page.  Make
          the  call  again using the returned token to retrieve the next page.
          Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each  pagination  token  expires
          after 24 hours.
