LIST-SPEAKER-ENROLLMENT-JOBS()                  LIST-SPEAKER-ENROLLMENT-JOBS()



NAME
       list-speaker-enrollment-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all the speaker enrollment jobs in the domain with the specified
       JobStatus . If JobStatus is not provided, this lists all jobs with  all
       possible speaker enrollment job statuses.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-speaker-enrollment-jobs  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: JobSummaries

OPTIONS
       --domain-id (string)
          The identifier of the domain containing the speaker enrollment jobs.

       --job-status (string)
          Provides the status of your speaker enrollment Job.

          Possible values:

          o SUBMITTED

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o COMPLETED

          o COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS

          o FAILED

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       JobSummaries -> (list)
          A list containing details about each  specified  speaker  enrollment
          job.

          (structure)
              Contains  a  summary  of  information about a speaker enrollment
              job.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp showing the creation time of the speaker  enroll-
                 ment job.

              DomainId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  of  the domain that contains the speaker en-
                 rollment job.

              EndedAt -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp showing when the speaker enrollment job ended.

              FailureDetails -> (structure)
                 Contains details that are populated when an entire batch  job
                 fails.  In cases of individual registration job failures, the
                 batch job as a whole doesn't fail; it  is  completed  with  a
                 JobStatus of COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS . You can use the job out-
                 put file to identify  the  individual  registration  requests
                 that failed.

                 Message -> (string)
                     A  description  of  the  error  that caused the batch job
                     failure.

                     An HTTP status code representing the nature of the error.

              JobId -> (string)
                 The service-generated identifier for the  speaker  enrollment
                 job.

              JobName -> (string)
                 The client-provided name for the speaker enrollment job.

              JobProgress -> (structure)
                 Provides details regarding job progress. This field shows the
                 completed percentage of enrollment requests listed in the in-
                 put file.

                 PercentComplete -> (integer)
                     Shows the completed percentage of enrollment or registra-
                     tion requests listed in the input file.

              JobStatus -> (string)
                 The current status of the speaker enrollment job.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If NextToken is returned, there  are  more  results  available.  The
          value  of NextToken is a unique pagination token for each page. Make
          the call again using the returned token to retrieve the  next  page.
          Keep  all  other  arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires
          after 24 hours.
