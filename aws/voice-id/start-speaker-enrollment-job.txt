OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          The  idempotency token for starting a new speaker enrollment Job. If
          not provided, Amazon Web Services SDK populates this field.

       --data-access-role-arn (string)
          The IAM role Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that grants Voice ID permis-
          sions  to  access customer's buckets to read the input manifest file
          and write the job output file. Refer to Batch enrollment using audio
          data  from  prior  calls documentation for the permissions needed in
          this role.

       --domain-id (string)
          The identifier of the domain that contains  the  speaker  enrollment
          job and in which the speakers are enrolled.

       --enrollment-config (structure)
          The  enrollment  config  that contains details such as the action to
          take when a speaker is already  enrolled  in  Voice  ID  or  when  a
          speaker is identified as a fraudster.

          ExistingEnrollmentAction -> (string)
              The  action  to  take  when the specified speaker is already en-
              rolled in the specified domain. The  default  value  is  SKIP  ,
              which skips the enrollment for the existing speaker. Setting the
              value to OVERWRITE replaces the existing voice  prints  and  en-
              rollment  audio  stored for that speaker with new data generated
              from the latest audio.

          FraudDetectionConfig -> (structure)
              The fraud detection configuration to use for the speaker enroll-
              ment job.

              FraudDetectionAction -> (string)
                 The  action  to take when the given speaker is flagged by the
                 fraud detection system. The default value  is  FAIL  ,  which
                 fails  the  speaker enrollment. Changing this value to IGNORE
                 results in the  speaker  being  enrolled  even  if  they  are
                 flagged by the fraud detection system.

              RiskThreshold -> (integer)
                 Threshold value for determining whether the speaker is a high
                 risk to be fraudulent. If the detected risk score  calculated
                 by  Voice  ID  is greater than or equal to the threshold, the
                 speaker is considered a fraudster.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ExistingEnrollmentAction=string,FraudDetectionConfig={FraudDetectionAction=string,RiskThreshold=integer}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Uri": "string"
          }

       --job-name (string)
          A name for your speaker enrollment job.

       --output-data-config (structure)
          The output data config containing the S3  location  where  Voice  ID
          writes  the  job  output file; you must also include a KMS key ID to
          encrypt the file.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              the identifier of the KMS key you want Voice ID to  use  to  en-
              crypt the output file of the fraudster registration job.

          S3Uri -> (string)
              The  S3  path of the folder where Voice ID writes the job output
              file. It has a *.out extension. For example, if the  input  file
              name  is input-file.json and the output folder path is s3://out-
              put-bucket/output-folder  ,  the  full  output  file   path   is
              s3://output-bucket/output-folder/job-Id/input-file.json.out .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KmsKeyId=string,S3Uri=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "KmsKeyId": "string",

          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              permissions to access customer's buckets to read the input mani-
              fest file and write the job output file.

          DomainId -> (string)

              ment job.

          EndedAt -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp showing when the speaker enrollment job ended.

          EnrollmentConfig -> (structure)

              speaker is already enrolled in Voice ID, and the FraudDetection-
              Config to use.

              ExistingEnrollmentAction -> (string)
                 The  action to take when the specified speaker is already en-
                 rolled in the specified domain. The default value is  SKIP  ,
                 which  skips the enrollment for the existing speaker. Setting
                 the value to OVERWRITE replaces the existing voice prints and
                 enrollment audio stored for that speaker with new data gener-
                 ated from the latest audio.

              FraudDetectionConfig -> (structure)

                     The  action  to take when the given speaker is flagged by
                     the fraud detection system. The default value is  FAIL  ,
                     which  fails  the speaker enrollment. Changing this value
                     to IGNORE results in the speaker being enrolled  even  if
                     they are flagged by the fraud detection system.

                 RiskThreshold -> (integer)
                     Threshold  value for determining whether the speaker is a
                     high risk to be fraudulent. If the  detected  risk  score

              fails.  In  cases  of  individual registration job failures, the
