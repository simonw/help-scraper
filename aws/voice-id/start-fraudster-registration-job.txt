OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          The idempotency token for starting a new fraudster registration job.
          If not provided, Amazon Web Services SDK populates this field.

       --data-access-role-arn (string)
          The IAM role Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that grants Voice ID permis-
          sions  to  access customer's buckets to read the input manifest file
          and write the Job output file. Refer to the Create and edit a fraud-
          ster  watchlist  documentation  for  the  permissions needed in this
          role.

       --domain-id (string)
          The identifier of the domain containing the  fraudster  registration
          job and in which the fraudsters are registered.

       --input-data-config (structure)
          The  input  data  config containing an S3 URI for the input manifest
          file that contains the list of fraudster registration requests.

          S3Uri -> (string)
              The S3 location for the input manifest file  that  contains  the
              list of individual enrollment or registration job requests.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Uri=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Uri": "string"
          }

       --job-name (string)
          The name of the new fraudster registration job.

       --output-data-config (structure)
          The  output  data  config  containing the S3 location where Voice ID
          writes the job output file; you must also include a KMS  Key  ID  to
          encrypt the file.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              the  identifier  of  the KMS key you want Voice ID to use to en-
              crypt the output file of the fraudster registration job.

          S3Uri -> (string)
              The S3 path of the folder to which Voice ID writes the job  out-
              put file, which has a *.out extension. For example, if the input
              file name is input-file.json  and  the  output  folder  path  is
              s3://output-bucket/output-folder  , the full output file path is
              s3://output-bucket/output-folder/job-Id/input-file.json.out .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KmsKeyId=string,S3Uri=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "KmsKeyId": "string",
            "S3Uri": "string"
          }

       --registration-config (structure)
          The registration config containing details such  as  the  action  to
          take  when  a  duplicate  fraudster  is detected, and the similarity
          threshold to use for detecting a duplicate fraudster.

          DuplicateRegistrationAction -> (string)
              The action to take when a fraudster is identified  as  a  dupli-
              cate.  The  default action is SKIP , which skips registering the
              duplicate fraudster. Setting the value to REGISTER_AS_NEW always
              registers a new fraudster into the specified domain.

          FraudsterSimilarityThreshold -> (integer)
              The  minimum similarity score between the new and old fraudsters
              in order to consider the new fraudster a duplicate.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DuplicateRegistrationAction=string,FraudsterSimilarityThreshold=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DuplicateRegistrationAction": "SKIP"|"REGISTER_AS_NEW",
            "FraudsterSimilarityThreshold": integer
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              tion job.

          DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The  IAM  role  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that grants Voice ID
              permissions to access customer's buckets to read the input mani-

              Status  of  COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS  .  You can use the job output
              file to  identify  the  individual  registration  requests  that
              failed.

                 Shows the completed percentage of enrollment or  registration
                 requests listed in the input file.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 the identifier of the KMS key you want Voice ID to use to en-
                 crypt the output file of the fraudster registration job.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The S3 path of the folder to which Voice ID  writes  the  job
                 output file, which has a *.out extension. For example, if the
                 input file name is input-file.json and the output folder path
                 is  s3://output-bucket/output-folder  ,  the full output file
                 path      is      s3://output-bucket/output-folder/job-Id/in-
                 put-file.json.out .

          RegistrationConfig -> (structure)
              The registration config containing details such as the action to

                 The action to take when a fraudster is identified as a dupli-
                 cate. The default action is SKIP ,  which  skips  registering
                 the duplicate fraudster. Setting the value to REGISTER_AS_NEW
                 always registers a new fraudster into the specified domain.

              FraudsterSimilarityThreshold -> (integer)
                 The minimum similarity score between the new and  old  fraud-
                 sters in order to consider the new fraudster a duplicate.
