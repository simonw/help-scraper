LIST-SERVICES()                                                LIST-SERVICES()



NAME
       list-services -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the names and codes for the services integrated with Service Quo-
       tas.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-services is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Services

SYNOPSIS
            list-services
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the available services

       The  following command lists the services that are available in Service
       Quotas.

          aws service-quotas list-services

       Output:

          {
              "Services": [
                  {
                      "ServiceCode": "AWSCloudMap",
                      "ServiceName": "AWS Cloud Map"
                  },
                  {
                      "ServiceCode": "access-analyzer",
                      "ServiceName": "Access Analyzer"
                  },
                  {
                      "ServiceCode": "acm",
                      "ServiceName": "AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)"
                  },

                  ...truncated...

                  {
                      "ServiceCode": "xray",
                      "ServiceName": "AWS X-Ray"
                  }
              ]
          }

       You can add the --query parameter to filter the display to the informa-
       tion  that  you  are interested in. The following example displays only
       the service codes.

          aws service-quotas list-services \
              --query Services[*].ServiceCode

       Output:

          [
              "AWSCloudMap",
              "access-analyzer",
              "acm",
              "acm-pca",
              "amplify",
              "apigateway",
              "application-autoscaling",
                  ...truncated...
              "xray"
          ]

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.

       Services -> (list)
          Information about the services.

          (structure)
              Information about a service.

              ServiceCode -> (string)
                 The service identifier.

              ServiceName -> (string)
                 The service name.
