NAME
       list-labeling-jobs-for-workteam -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of labeling jobs assigned to a specified work team.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-labeling-jobs-for-workteam  is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: LabelingJobSummaryList

SYNOPSIS
            list-labeling-jobs-for-workteam
          --workteam-arn <value>
          [--creation-time-after <value>]
          [--creation-time-before <value>]
          [--job-reference-code-contains <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --workteam-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the work team for which  you  want
          to see labeling jobs for.

       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only labeling jobs created after the specified
          time (timestamp).

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only labeling jobs created before  the  speci-
          fied time (timestamp).

       --job-reference-code-contains (string)
          A  filter  the limits jobs to only the ones whose job reference code
          contains the specified string.

       --sort-by (string)
          The field to sort results by. The default is CreationTime .

          Possible values:

          o CreationTime

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for results. The default is Ascending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LabelingJobSummaryList -> (list)
          An array of LabelingJobSummary objects, each describing  a  labeling
          job.

          (structure)

              WorkRequesterAccountId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web  Services  account ID of the account used to

                 The date and time that the labeling job was created.

              LabelCounters -> (structure)
                 Provides information about the progress of a labeling job.

                 HumanLabeled -> (integer)
                     The total number of  data  objects  labeled  by  a  human
                     worker.

                 PendingHuman -> (integer)
                     The  total number of data objects that need to be labeled

                 Total -> (integer)
                     The total number of tasks in the labeling job.

              NumberOfHumanWorkersPerDataObject -> (integer)
                 The configured number of workers per data object.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, Amazon SageMaker returns  this  token.
          To  retrieve the next set of labeling jobs, use it in the subsequent
          request.
