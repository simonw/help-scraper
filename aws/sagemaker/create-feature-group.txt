CREATE-FEATURE-GROUP()                                  CREATE-FEATURE-GROUP()



NAME
       create-feature-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Create  a  new FeatureGroup . A FeatureGroup is a group of Features de-
       fined in the FeatureStore to describe a Record .

       The FeatureGroup defines the schema and features contained in the  Fea-
       tureGroup.  A FeatureGroup definition is composed of a list of Features
       , a RecordIdentifierFeatureName , an EventTimeFeatureName and  configu-
       rations  for  its  OnlineStore and OfflineStore . Check Amazon Web Ser-
       vices service quotas to see the FeatureGroup s quota  for  your  Amazon
       Web Services account.

       WARNING:
          You must include at least one of OnlineStoreConfig and OfflineStore-
          Config to create a FeatureGroup .

OPTIONS
       --feature-group-name (string)
          The name of the FeatureGroup . The name must  be  unique  within  an
          Amazon  Web  Services  Region in an Amazon Web Services account. The
          name:

          o Must start and end with an alphanumeric character.

          o Can only contain alphanumeric character and  hyphens.  Spaces  are
            not allowed.

       --record-identifier-feature-name (string)
          The name of the Feature whose value uniquely identifies a Record de-
          fined in the FeatureStore . Only the latest  record  per  identifier
          value  will  be stored in the OnlineStore . RecordIdentifierFeature-
          Name must be one of feature definitions' names.

          You use the RecordIdentifierFeatureName to access data in a Feature-
          Store .

          This name:

          o Must start and end with an alphanumeric character.

          o Can  only  contains alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores.
            Spaces are not allowed.

       --event-time-feature-name (string)
          The name of the feature that stores the EventTime of a Record  in  a
          FeatureGroup .

          An  EventTime is a point in time when a new event occurs that corre-
          sponds to the creation or update of a Record in a FeatureGroup . All
          Records in the FeatureGroup must have a corresponding EventTime .

          An EventTime can be a String or Fractional .

          o Fractional  : EventTime feature values must be a Unix timestamp in
            seconds.

          o String : EventTime feature values must be an  ISO-8601  string  in
            the     format.    The    following    formats    are    supported
            yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ and yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ where yyyy ,
            MM , and dd represent the year, month, and day respectively and HH
            , mm , ss , and if applicable, SSS represent the hour, month, sec-
            ond and milliseconds respsectively. 'T' and Z are constants.

       --offline-store-config (structure)
          Use this to configure an OfflineFeatureStore . This parameter allows

            vices Hive data catalog.

          o An KMS encryption key to encrypt the Amazon S3 location  used  for
            OfflineStore  . If KMS encryption key is not specified, by default
            we encrypt all data at rest using Amazon Web Services KMS key.  By
            defining  your bucket-level key for SSE, you can reduce Amazon Web
            Services KMS requests costs by up to 99 percent.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
