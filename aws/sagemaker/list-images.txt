LIST-IMAGES()                                                    LIST-IMAGES()



NAME
       list-images -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the images in your account and their properties. The list can be
       filtered by creation time or modified time, and whether the image  name
       contains a specified string.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-images  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Images

OPTIONS
       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only images created on or after the  specified
          time.

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only images created on or before the specified
          time.

       --last-modified-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only images modified on or after the specified
          time.

       --last-modified-time-before (timestamp)
          A  filter  that returns only images modified on or before the speci-
          fied time.

       --name-contains (string)
          A filter that returns only images whose name contains the  specified
          string.

       --sort-by (string)
          The  property  used  to  sort  results.  The  default  value is CRE-
          ATION_TIME .

          Possible values:

          o CREATION_TIME

          o LAST_MODIFIED_TIME

          o IMAGE_NAME

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order. The default value is DESCENDING .

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              tainer images that are derived from a common base container  im-
              age.  Each  of  these container images is represented by a Sage-
              Maker ImageVersion .

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the image was created.

              Description -> (string)

              DisplayName -> (string)
                 The name of the image as displayed.

              FailureReason -> (string)
                 When a create, update, or delete operation fails, the  reason
                 for the failure.

              ImageArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the image.

              ImageName -> (string)
                 The name of the image.

              ImageStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the image.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the image was last modified.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token for getting the next set of images, if there are any.
