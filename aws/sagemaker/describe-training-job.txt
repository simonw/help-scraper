NAME
       describe-training-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about a training job.

       Some  of  the attributes below only appear if the training job success-
       fully starts. If the training job fails,  TrainingJobStatus  is  Failed
       and, depending on the FailureReason , attributes like TrainingStartTime
       , TrainingTimeInSeconds , TrainingEndTime ,  and  BillableTimeInSeconds
       may not be present in the response.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-training-job
          --training-job-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --training-job-name (string)
          The name of the training job.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       TrainingJobStatus -> (string)
          The status of the training job.

          Amazon SageMaker provides the following training job statuses:

          o InProgress - The training is in progress.

          o Completed - The training job has completed.

          o Failed - The training job has failed. To see the  reason  for  the
            failure,  see the FailureReason field in the response to a Descri-
            beTrainingJobResponse call.

          o Stopping - The training job is stopping.

          o Stopped - The training job has stopped.

          For more detailed information, see SecondaryStatus .

       SecondaryStatus -> (string)
          Provides detailed information about the state of the  training  job.
          For  detailed  information  on  the secondary status of the training
          job, see StatusMessage under  SecondaryStatusTransition .

          Amazon SageMaker provides primary statuses  and  secondary  statuses
          that apply to each of them:
              InProgress

          o Starting - Starting the training job.

          o Downloading  -  An optional stage for algorithms that support File
            training input mode. It indicates that data is being downloaded to
            the ML storage volumes.

          o Training - Training is in progress.

          o Interrupted  -  The  job stopped because the managed spot training
            instances were interrupted.

          o Uploading - Training is complete and the model artifacts are being
            uploaded to the S3 location.

            Completed

          o Completed - The training job has completed.

            Failed

          o Failed  -  The training job has failed. The reason for the failure
            is returned in the FailureReason field  of  DescribeTrainingJobRe-
            sponse .

            Stopped

          o MaxRuntimeExceeded - The job stopped because it exceeded the maxi-
            mum allowed runtime.

          o MaxWaitTimeExceeded - The job stopped because it exceeded the max-
            imum allowed wait time.

          o Stopped - The training job has stopped.

            Stopping

          o Stopping - Stopping the training job.

          WARNING:
              Valid values for SecondaryStatus are subject to change.

          We no longer support the following secondary statuses:

          o LaunchingMLInstances

          o PreparingTraining

          o DownloadingTrainingImage

       FailureReason -> (string)
          If the training job failed, the reason it failed.

       HyperParameters -> (map)
          Algorithm-specific parameters.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       AlgorithmSpecification -> (structure)
          Information  about  the  algorithm  used for training, and algorithm
          metadata.

          TrainingImage -> (string)
              The registry path of the Docker image that contains the training
              algorithm.  For  information  about  docker  registry  paths for
              built-in algorithms, see Algorithms  Provided  by  Amazon  Sage-
              Maker:  Common  Parameters . Amazon SageMaker supports both reg-
              istry/repository[:tag]  and  registry/repository[@digest]  image
              path  formats.  For  more  information, see Using Your Own Algo-
              rithms with Amazon SageMaker .

          AlgorithmName -> (string)
              The name of the algorithm resource to use for the training  job.
              This must be an algorithm resource that you created or subscribe
              to on Amazon Web Services Marketplace. If you  specify  a  value
              for  this parameter, you can't specify a value for TrainingImage
              .

          TrainingInputMode -> (string)
              The training input mode that the algorithm  supports.  For  more
              information about input modes, see Algorithms .
                 Pipe mode

              If  an  algorithm  supports  Pipe mode, Amazon SageMaker streams
              data directly from Amazon S3 to the container.
                 File mode

              If an algorithm supports  File  mode,  SageMaker  downloads  the
              training  data from S3 to the provisioned ML storage volume, and
              mounts the directory to the Docker volume for the training  con-
              tainer.

              You  must provision the ML storage volume with sufficient capac-
              ity to accommodate the data downloaded from S3. In  addition  to
              the  training data, the ML storage volume also stores the output
              model. The algorithm container uses the  ML  storage  volume  to
              also store intermediate information, if any.

              For  distributed  algorithms,  training data is distributed uni-
              formly. Your training duration is predictable if the input  data
              objects  sizes  are  approximately  the same. SageMaker does not
              split the files any further for model training.  If  the  object
              sizes  are skewed, training won't be optimal as the data distri-
              bution is also skewed when one host in  a  training  cluster  is
              overloaded, thus becoming a bottleneck in training.
                 FastFile mode

              If  an  algorithm supports FastFile mode, SageMaker streams data
              directly from S3 to the container with no code changes, and pro-
              vides  file  system  access  to the data. Users can author their
              training script to interact with these files  as  if  they  were
              stored on disk.
                 FastFile  mode works best when the data is read sequentially.
                 Augmented manifest files aren't supported. The  startup  time
                 is  lower  when  there  are fewer files in the S3 bucket pro-
                 vided.

          MetricDefinitions -> (list)
              A list of metric definition objects. Each object  specifies  the
              metric  name  and  regular  expressions  used to parse algorithm
              logs. Amazon SageMaker publishes each metric  to  Amazon  Cloud-
              Watch.

              (structure)
                 Specifies  a  metric  that  the  training algorithm writes to
                 stderr or stdout . Amazon SageMakerhyperparameter tuning cap-
                 tures  all defined metrics. You specify one metric that a hy-
                 perparameter tuning job  uses  as  its  objective  metric  to
                 choose the best training job.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of the metric.

                 Regex -> (string)
                     A regular expression that searches the output of a train-
                     ing job and gets the value of the metric. For more infor-
                     mation about using regular expressions to define metrics,
                     see Defining Objective Metrics .

          EnableSageMakerMetricsTimeSeries -> (boolean)
              To generate and save time-series metrics during training, set to
              true  . The default is false and time-series metrics aren't gen-
              erated except in the following cases:

              o You use one of the Amazon SageMaker built-in algorithms

              o You use one of the following Prebuilt Amazon SageMaker  Docker
                Images :

                o Tensorflow (version >= 1.15)

                o MXNet (version >= 1.6)

                o PyTorch (version >= 1.3)

              o You specify at least one  MetricDefinition

       RoleArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Web  Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) role
          configured for the training job.

       InputDataConfig -> (list)
          An array of Channel objects that describes each data input channel.

          (structure)
              A channel is a named input source that training  algorithms  can
              consume.

              ChannelName -> (string)
                 The name of the channel.

              DataSource -> (structure)
                 The location of the channel data.

                 S3DataSource -> (structure)
                     The  S3  location  of  the data source that is associated
                     with a channel.

                     S3DataType -> (string)
                        If you choose S3Prefix , S3Uri identifies a  key  name
                        prefix.  Amazon  SageMaker uses all objects that match
                        the specified key name prefix for model training.

                        If you choose ManifestFile , S3Uri identifies  an  ob-
                        ject  that is a manifest file containing a list of ob-
                        ject keys that you want Amazon SageMaker  to  use  for
                        model training.

                        If you choose AugmentedManifestFile , S3Uri identifies
                        an object that is an augmented manifest file  in  JSON
                        lines  format. This file contains the data you want to
                        use for model training. AugmentedManifestFile can only
                        be used if the Channel's input mode is Pipe .

                     S3Uri -> (string)
                        Depending  on the value specified for the S3DataType ,
                        identifies either a key name prefix or a manifest. For
                        example:

                        o A key name prefix might look like this: s3://bucket-
                          name/exampleprefix

                        o A manifest might look like this: s3://bucketname/ex-
                          ample.manifest   A manifest is an S3 object which is
                          a JSON file consisting of an array of elements.  The
                          first  element  is a prefix which is followed by one
                          or more suffixes. SageMaker appends the suffix  ele-
                          ments  to  the  prefix  to get a full set of S3Uri .
                          Note that the prefix must be a valid non-empty S3Uri
                          that  precludes  users  from  specifying  a manifest
                          whose individual S3Uri is sourced from different  S3
                          buckets.  The  following  code example shows a valid
                          manifest   format:     [    {"prefix":    "s3://cus-
                          tomer_bucket/some/prefix/"},                  "rela-
                          tive/path/to/custdata-1",       "relative/path/cust-
                          data-2",     ...     "relative/path/custdata-N"    ]
                          This JSON is equivalent to the following S3Uri list:
                          s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/rela-
                          tive/path/to/custdata-1                    s3://cus-
                          tomer_bucket/some/prefix/relative/path/custdata-2
                          ...           s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/rela-
                          tive/path/custdata-N    The complete set of S3Uri in
                          this manifest is the input data for the channel  for
                          this  data source. The object that each S3Uri points
                          to must be readable by  the  IAM  role  that  Amazon
                          SageMaker uses to perform tasks on your behalf.

                     S3DataDistributionType -> (string)
                        If  you  want Amazon SageMaker to replicate the entire
                        dataset on each ML compute instance that  is  launched
                        for model training, specify FullyReplicated .

                        If  you want Amazon SageMaker to replicate a subset of
                        data on each ML compute instance that is launched  for
                        model  training, specify ShardedByS3Key . If there are
                        n ML compute instances launched for  a  training  job,
                        each  instance gets approximately 1/n of the number of
                        S3 objects. In this case, model training on  each  ma-
                        chine uses only the subset of training data.

                        Don't  choose  more  ML compute instances for training
                        than available S3 objects. If you do, some nodes won't
                        get  any  data  and you will pay for nodes that aren't
                        getting any training data. This applies in  both  File
                        and  Pipe modes. Keep this in mind when developing al-
                        gorithms.

                        In distributed training, where  you  use  multiple  ML
                        compute EC2 instances, you might choose ShardedByS3Key
                        . If the algorithm requires copying training  data  to
                        the  ML  storage volume (when TrainingInputMode is set
                        to File ), this copies 1/n of the number of objects.

                     AttributeNames -> (list)
                        A list of one or more attribute names to use that  are
                        found in a specified augmented manifest file.

                        (string)

                 FileSystemDataSource -> (structure)
                     The file system that is associated with a channel.

                     FileSystemId -> (string)
                        The file system id.

                     FileSystemAccessMode -> (string)
                        The  access mode of the mount of the directory associ-
                        ated with the channel. A directory can be mounted  ei-
                        ther in ro (read-only) or rw (read-write) mode.

                     FileSystemType -> (string)
                        The file system type.

                     DirectoryPath -> (string)
                        The  full  path to the directory to associate with the
                        channel.

              ContentType -> (string)
                 The MIME type of the data.

              CompressionType -> (string)
                 If training data is compressed, the compression type. The de-
                 fault  value  is  None . CompressionType is used only in Pipe
                 input mode. In File mode, leave this field unset or set it to
                 None.

              RecordWrapperType -> (string)
                 Specify  RecordIO as the value when input data is in raw for-
                 mat but the training algorithm requires the RecordIO  format.
                 In  this  case, Amazon SageMaker wraps each individual S3 ob-
                 ject in a RecordIO record. If the input data  is  already  in
                 RecordIO  format,  you  don't need to set this attribute. For
                 more information, see Create a Dataset Using RecordIO .

                 In File mode, leave this field unset or set it to None.

              InputMode -> (string)
                 (Optional) The input mode to use for the data  channel  in  a
                 training job. If you don't set a value for InputMode , Amazon
                 SageMaker uses the value set for TrainingInputMode . Use this
                 parameter to override the TrainingInputMode setting in a  Al-
                 gorithmSpecification request when you  have  a  channel  that
                 needs  a different input mode from the training job's general
                 setting. To download the data from Amazon Simple Storage Ser-
                 vice  (Amazon  S3)  to the provisioned ML storage volume, and
                 mount the directory to a Docker volume, use File input  mode.
                 To  stream  data  directly  from  Amazon S3 to the container,
                 choose Pipe input mode.

                 To use a model for incremental training,  choose  File  input
                 model.

              ShuffleConfig -> (structure)
                 A  configuration  for  a  shuffle  option for input data in a
                 channel. If you use S3Prefix for S3DataType ,  this  shuffles
                 the  results  of  the S3 key prefix matches. If you use Mani-
                 festFile , the order of the S3 object references in the Mani-
                 festFile  is shuffled. If you use AugmentedManifestFile , the
                 order of the JSON lines in the AugmentedManifestFile is shuf-
                 fled. The shuffling order is determined using the Seed value.

                 For  Pipe input mode, shuffling is done at the start of every
                 epoch. With large datasets this ensures that the order of the
                 training  data  is  different for each epoch, it helps reduce
                 bias and possible overfitting. In a multi-node  training  job
                 when ShuffleConfig is combined with S3DataDistributionType of
                 ShardedByS3Key , the data is shuffled across  nodes  so  that
                 the  content  sent  to  a  particular node on the first epoch
                 might be sent to a different node on the second epoch.

                 Seed -> (long)
                     Determines the shuffling order in ShuffleConfig value.

       OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
          The S3 path where model artifacts that you configured when  creating
          the  job  are  stored. Amazon SageMaker creates subfolders for model
          artifacts.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web  Ser-
              vices  KMS)  key that Amazon SageMaker uses to encrypt the model
              artifacts at rest using Amazon S3  server-side  encryption.  The
              KmsKeyId can be any of the following formats:

              o // KMS Key ID  "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

              o //    Amazon    Resource    Name    (ARN)   of   a   KMS   Key
                "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

              o // KMS Key Alias  "alias/ExampleAlias"

              o //   Amazon   Resource   Name   (ARN)   of  a  KMS  Key  Alias
                "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias"

              If you use a KMS key ID or an alias of your KMS key, the  Amazon
              SageMaker  execution  role  must  include  permissions  to  call
              kms:Encrypt . If you don't provide a KMS key  ID,  Amazon  Sage-
              Maker uses the default KMS key for Amazon S3 for your role's ac-
              count.  Amazon  SageMaker  uses  server-side   encryption   with
              KMS-managed keys for OutputDataConfig . If you use a bucket pol-
              icy with an s3:PutObject permission  that  only  allows  objects
              with   server-side   encryption,   set   the  condition  key  of
              s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption to "aws:kms" . For more informa-
              tion, see KMS-Managed Encryption Keys in the Amazon Simple Stor-
              age Service Developer Guide.

              The KMS key policy must grant permission to the  IAM  role  that
              you  specify in your CreateTrainingJob , CreateTransformJob , or
              CreateHyperParameterTuningJob requests.  For  more  information,
              see  Using Key Policies in Amazon Web Services KMS in the Amazon
              Web Services Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          S3OutputPath -> (string)
              Identifies the S3 path where you want Amazon SageMaker to  store
              the model artifacts. For example, s3://bucket-name/key-name-pre-
              fix .

       ResourceConfig -> (structure)
          Resources, including ML compute instances and  ML  storage  volumes,
          that are configured for model training.

          InstanceType -> (string)
              The ML compute instance type.

          InstanceCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of  ML  compute  instances  to use. For distributed
              training, provide a value greater than 1.

          VolumeSizeInGB -> (integer)
              The size of the ML storage volume that you want to provision.

              ML storage volumes store model artifacts and incremental states.
              Training  algorithms  might  also  use the ML storage volume for
              scratch space. If you want to store the training data in the  ML
              storage  volume, choose File as the TrainingInputMode in the al-
              gorithm specification.

              You must specify sufficient ML storage for your scenario.

              NOTE:
                 Amazon SageMaker supports only the General Purpose SSD  (gp2)
                 ML storage volume type.

              NOTE:
                 Certain  Nitro-based  instances  include local storage with a
                 fixed total size, dependent on the instance type. When  using
                 these instances for training, Amazon SageMaker mounts the lo-
                 cal instance storage instead of Amazon EBS gp2  storage.  You
                 can't request a VolumeSizeInGB greater than the total size of
                 the local instance storage.

                 For a list of instance  types  that  support  local  instance
                 storage,  including  the  total  size  per instance type, see
                 Instance Store Volumes .

          VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services KMS key that Amazon  SageMaker  uses  to
              encrypt  data  on  the storage volume attached to the ML compute
              instance(s) that run the training job.

              NOTE:
                 Certain Nitro-based instances include local  storage,  depen-
                 dent  on  the  instance  type.  Local storage volumes are en-
                 crypted using a hardware module on the  instance.  You  can't
                 request a VolumeKmsKeyId when using an instance type with lo-
                 cal storage.

                 For a list of instance  types  that  support  local  instance
                 storage, see Instance Store Volumes .

                 For more information about local instance storage encryption,
                 see SSD Instance Store Volumes .

              The VolumeKmsKeyId can be in any of the following formats:

              o // KMS Key ID  "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

              o //   Amazon   Resource   Name   (ARN)    of    a    KMS    Key
                "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

       VpcConfig -> (structure)
          A  VpcConfig object that specifies the VPC that  this  training  job
          has  access  to.  For more information, see Protect Training Jobs by
          Using an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud .

          SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              The VPC security group IDs, in the form sg-xxxxxxxx. Specify the
              security  groups  for  the  VPC that is specified in the Subnets
              field.

              (string)

          Subnets -> (list)
              The ID of the subnets in the VPC to which you  want  to  connect
              your training job or model. For information about the availabil-
              ity of specific instance types, see Supported Instance Types and
              Availability Zones .

              (string)

       StoppingCondition -> (structure)
          Specifies  a limit to how long a model training job can run. It also
          specifies how long a managed Spot training job has to complete. When
          the  job  reaches the time limit, Amazon SageMaker ends the training
          job. Use this API to cap model training costs.

          To stop a job, Amazon SageMaker sends the algorithm the SIGTERM sig-
          nal,  which  delays  job termination for 120 seconds. Algorithms can
          use this 120-second window to save the model artifacts, so  the  re-
          sults of training are not lost.

          MaxRuntimeInSeconds -> (integer)
              The  maximum length of time, in seconds, that a training or com-
              pilation job can run.

              For compilation jobs, if the job does not complete  during  this
              time,  you  will  receive a TimeOut error. We recommend starting
              with 900 seconds and increase as necessary based on your model.

              For all other jobs, if the job does  not  complete  during  this
              time, Amazon SageMaker ends the job. When RetryStrategy is spec-
              ified in the job request, MaxRuntimeInSeconds specifies the max-
              imum  time for all of the attempts in total, not each individual
              attempt. The default value is 1 day. The  maximum  value  is  28
              days.

          MaxWaitTimeInSeconds -> (integer)
              The  maximum  length  of  time,  in seconds, that a managed Spot
              training job has to complete. It is the  amount  of  time  spent
              waiting  for  Spot  capacity plus the amount of time the job can
              run. It must be equal to or greater than  MaxRuntimeInSeconds  .
              If  the job does not complete during this time, Amazon SageMaker
              ends the job.

              When RetryStrategy is specified in  the  job  request,  MaxWait-
              TimeInSeconds specifies the maximum time for all of the attempts
              in total, not each individual attempt.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          A timestamp that indicates when the training job was created.

       TrainingStartTime -> (timestamp)
          Indicates the time when the training  job  starts  on  training  in-
          stances.  You are billed for the time interval between this time and
          the value of TrainingEndTime . The start  time  in  CloudWatch  Logs
          might  be later than this time. The difference is due to the time it
          takes to download the training data and to the size of the  training
          container.

       TrainingEndTime -> (timestamp)
          Indicates the time when the training job ends on training instances.
          You are billed for the time interval between  the  value  of  Train-
          ingStartTime  and  this  time. For successful jobs and stopped jobs,
          this is the time after model  artifacts  are  uploaded.  For  failed
          jobs, this is the time when Amazon SageMaker detects a job failure.

       LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
          A  timestamp  that indicates when the status of the training job was
          last modified.

       SecondaryStatusTransitions -> (list)
          A history of all of the secondary statuses that the training job has
          transitioned through.

          (structure)
              An  array  element of  DescribeTrainingJobResponse$SecondarySta-
              tusTransitions . It provides additional details about  a  status
              that  the  training job has transitioned through. A training job
              can be in one of several states, for  example,  starting,  down-
              loading,  training, or uploading. Within each state, there are a
              number of intermediate states. For example, within the  starting
              state,  Amazon  SageMaker  could be starting the training job or
              launching the ML instances. These transitional  states  are  re-
              ferred to as the job's secondary status.

              Status -> (string)
                 Contains a secondary status information from a training job.

                 Status might be one of the following secondary statuses:
                     InProgress

                 o Starting - Starting the training job.

                 o Downloading - An optional stage for algorithms that support
                   File training input mode. It indicates that data  is  being
                   downloaded to the ML storage volumes.

                 o Training - Training is in progress.

                 o Uploading  -  Training  is complete and the model artifacts
                   are being uploaded to the S3 location.

                   Completed

                 o Completed - The training job has completed.

                   Failed

                 o Failed - The training job has failed. The  reason  for  the
                   failure is returned in the FailureReason field of Describe-
                   TrainingJobResponse .

                   Stopped

                 o MaxRuntimeExceeded - The job stopped  because  it  exceeded
                   the maximum allowed runtime.

                 o Stopped - The training job has stopped.

                   Stopping

                 o Stopping - Stopping the training job.

                 We no longer support the following secondary statuses:

                 o LaunchingMLInstances

                 o PreparingTrainingStack

                 o DownloadingTrainingImage

              StartTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  timestamp that shows when the training job transitioned to
                 the current secondary status state.

              EndTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp that shows when the training job transitioned out
                 of  this secondary status state into another secondary status
                 state or when the training job has ended.

              StatusMessage -> (string)
                 A detailed description of the  progress  within  a  secondary
                 status.

                 Amazon  SageMaker provides secondary statuses and status mes-
                 sages that apply to each of them:
                     Starting

                 o Starting the training job.

                 o Launching requested ML instances.

                 o Insufficient capacity error from EC2  while  launching  in-
                   stances, retrying!

                 o Launched instance was unhealthy, replacing it!

                 o Preparing the instances for training.

                   Training

                 o Downloading the training image.

                 o Training image download completed. Training in progress.

                 WARNING:
                     Status messages are subject to change. Therefore, we rec-
                     ommend not including them in code  that  programmatically
                     initiates  actions.  For  examples, don't use status mes-
                     sages in if statements.

                 To have an overview of your  training  job's  progress,  view
                 TrainingJobStatus and SecondaryStatus in  DescribeTrainingJob
                 , and StatusMessage together. For example, at the start of  a
                 training job, you might see the following:

                 o TrainingJobStatus - InProgress

                 o SecondaryStatus - Training

                 o StatusMessage - Downloading the training image

       FinalMetricDataList -> (list)
          A  collection  of MetricData objects that specify the names, values,
          and dates and times that the training algorithm  emitted  to  Amazon
          CloudWatch.

          (structure)
              The  name, value, and date and time of a metric that was emitted
              to Amazon CloudWatch.

              MetricName -> (string)
                 The name of the metric.

              Value -> (float)
                 The value of the metric.

              Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the algorithm emitted the metric.

       EnableNetworkIsolation -> (boolean)
          If you want to allow inbound or outbound network calls,  except  for
          calls between peers within a training cluster for distributed train-
          ing, choose True . If you enable network isolation for training jobs
          that are configured to use a VPC, Amazon SageMaker downloads and up-
          loads customer data and model artifacts through the  specified  VPC,
          but the training container does not have network access.

       EnableInterContainerTrafficEncryption -> (boolean)
          To  encrypt  all communications between ML compute instances in dis-
          tributed training, choose True . Encryption provides  greater  secu-
          rity  for  distributed training, but training might take longer. How
          long it takes depends on the amount of communication between compute
          instances,  especially if you use a deep learning algorithms in dis-
          tributed training.

       EnableManagedSpotTraining -> (boolean)
          A Boolean indicating whether managed spot training is enabled  (True
          ) or not (False ).

       CheckpointConfig -> (structure)
          Contains  information  about  the  output  location for managed spot
          training checkpoint data.

          S3Uri -> (string)
              Identifies the S3 path where you want Amazon SageMaker to  store
              checkpoints. For example, s3://bucket-name/key-name-prefix .

          LocalPath -> (string)
              (Optional)  The  local  directory where checkpoints are written.
              The default directory is /opt/ml/checkpoints/ .

       TrainingTimeInSeconds -> (integer)
          The training time in seconds.

       BillableTimeInSeconds -> (integer)
          The billable time in seconds. Billable time refers to  the  absolute
          wall-clock time.

          Multiply BillableTimeInSeconds by the number of instances (Instance-
          Count ) in your training cluster to get the total compute time Sage-
          Maker  will bill you if you run distributed training. The formula is
          as follows: BillableTimeInSeconds * InstanceCount .

          You can calculate the savings from using managed spot training using
          the  formula  (1  - BillableTimeInSeconds / TrainingTimeInSeconds) *
          100 . For example, if BillableTimeInSeconds  is  100  and  Training-
          TimeInSeconds is 500, the savings is 80%.

       DebugHookConfig -> (structure)
          Configuration  information  for the Debugger hook parameters, metric
          and tensor collections, and storage paths. To learn more  about  how
