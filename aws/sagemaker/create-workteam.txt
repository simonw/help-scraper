CREATE-WORKTEAM()                                            CREATE-WORKTEAM()



NAME
       create-workteam -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new work team for labeling your data. A work team is defined
       by one or more Amazon Cognito user pools. You  must  first  create  the
       user pools before you can create a work team.

       You cannot create more than 25 work teams in an account and region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-workteam
          --workteam-name <value>
          [--workforce-name <value>]
          --member-definitions <value>
          --description <value>
          [--notification-configuration <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --workteam-name (string)
          The name of the work team. Use this name to identify the work team.

       --workforce-name (string)
          The name of the workforce.

       --member-definitions (list)
          A  list of MemberDefinition objects that contains objects that iden-
          tify the workers that make up the work team.

          Workforces can be created using Amazon  Cognito  or  your  own  OIDC
          Identity Provider (IdP). For private workforces created using Amazon
          Cognito use CognitoMemberDefinition . For workforces  created  using
          your  own OIDC identity provider (IdP) use OidcMemberDefinition . Do
          not provide input for both of these parameters in a single request.

          For workforces created using Amazon Cognito, private work teams cor-
          respond  to  Amazon Cognito user groups within the user pool used to
          create a workforce. All of the CognitoMemberDefinition objects  that
          make  up the member definition must have the same ClientId and User-
          Pool values. To add a Amazon  Cognito  user  group  to  an  existing
          worker pool, see Adding groups to a User Pool . For more information
          about user pools, see `Amazon Cognito User Pools .

          For workforces created using your own OIDC  IdP,  specify  the  user
          groups  that  you  want to include in your private work team in Oid-
          cMemberDefinition by listing those groups in Groups .

          (structure)
              Defines an Amazon Cognito or your own OIDC IdP user  group  that
              is part of a work team.

              CognitoMemberDefinition -> (structure)
                 The Amazon Cognito user group that is part of the work team.

                 UserPool -> (string)
                     An  identifier  for a user pool. The user pool must be in
                     the same region as the service that you are calling.

                 UserGroup -> (string)
                     An identifier for a user group.

                 ClientId -> (string)
                     An identifier for an application client. You must  create
                     the app client ID using Amazon Cognito.

              OidcMemberDefinition -> (structure)
                 A  list user groups that exist in your OIDC Identity Provider
                 (IdP). One to ten groups can be used to create a single  pri-
                 vate  work  team.  When  you  add a user group to the list of
                 Groups , you can add that user group to one or  more  private
                 work  teams.  If you add a user group to a private work team,
                 all workers in that user group are added to the work team.

                 Groups -> (list)
                     A list of comma seperated strings  that  identifies  user
                     groups  in your OIDC IdP. Each user group is made up of a
                     group of private workers.

              rameter tuning jobs,  batch  transform  jobs,  models,  labeling
              jobs,  work  teams,  endpoint configurations, and endpoints. For
              more information on adding tags to SageMaker resources, see  Ad-
              dTags .

              vices resources with tagging, see Tagging  Amazon  Web  Services
              resources . For advice on best practices for managing Amazon Web
              Services resources with tagging, see Tagging Best Practices: Im-

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       WorkteamArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the work team. You can use this
          ARN to identify the work team.
