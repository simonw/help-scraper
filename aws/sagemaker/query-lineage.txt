SYNOPSIS
            query-lineage
          --start-arns <value>
          [--direction <value>]
          [--include-edges | --no-include-edges]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--max-depth <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]

OPTIONS
       --start-arns (list)
          A  list  of  resource  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that represent the
          starting point for your lineage query.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --direction (string)
          Associations between lineage entities have a direction. This parame-
          ter  determines  the  direction  from the StartArn(s) that the query
          traverses.

          Possible values:

          o Both

          o Ascendants

          o Descendants

       --include-edges | --no-include-edges (boolean)
          Setting this value to True retrieves not only the entities of inter-
          est  but also the Associations and lineage entities on the path. Set
          to False to only return lineage entities that match your query.

       --filters (structure)
          A set of filtering parameters that allow you to specify which  enti-
          ties should be returned.

          o Properties  -  Key-value  pairs  to match on the lineage entities'
            properties.

          o LineageTypes - A set of lineage entity types to match on. For  ex-
            ample: TrialComponent , Artifact , or Context .

          o CreatedBefore - Filter entities created before this date.

          o ModifiedBefore - Filter entities modified before this date.

          o ModifiedAfter - Filter entities modified after this date.

          Types -> (list)
              Filter  the  lineage entities connected to the StartArn by type.
              For example: DataSet , Model , Endpoint , or ModelDeployment .

              (string)

          LineageTypes -> (list)
              Filter the lineage entities connected to the StartArn (s) by the
              type of the lineage entity.

              (string)

          CreatedBefore -> (timestamp)
              Filter  the  lineage  entities  connected to the StartArn (s) by
              created date.

          CreatedAfter -> (timestamp)
              Filter the lineage entities connected to the StartArn (s)  after
              the create date.

          ModifiedBefore -> (timestamp)
              Filter the lineage entities connected to the StartArn (s) before
              the last modified date.

          ModifiedAfter -> (timestamp)
              Filter the lineage entities connected to the StartArn (s)  after
              the last modified date.

          Properties -> (map)
              Filter  the  lineage entities connected to the StartArn (s) by a
              set if property key value pairs. If multiple pairs are provided,
              an  entity  is  included in the results if it matches any of the
              provided pairs.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Types=string,string,LineageTypes=string,string,CreatedBefore=timestamp,CreatedAfter=timestamp,ModifiedBefore=timestamp,ModifiedAfter=timestamp,Properties={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Types": ["string", ...],
            "LineageTypes": ["TrialComponent"|"Artifact"|"Context"|"Action", ...],
            "CreatedBefore": timestamp,
            "CreatedAfter": timestamp,
            "ModifiedBefore": timestamp,
            "ModifiedAfter": timestamp,
            "Properties": {"string": "string"
              ...}
          }

       --max-depth (integer)
          The maximum depth in lineage relationships from the  StartArns  that
          are traversed. Depth is a measure of the number of Associations from
          the StartArn entity to the matched results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Limits the number of vertices in the results. Use the NextToken in a
          response to to retrieve the next page of results.

       --next-token (string)
          Limits the number of vertices in the request. Use the NextToken in a
          response to to retrieve the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 source.

                 of the directed edge.

              DestinationArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the destination lineage en-
