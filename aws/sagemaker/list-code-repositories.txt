LIST-CODE-REPOSITORIES()                              LIST-CODE-REPOSITORIES()



NAME
       list-code-repositories -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of the Git repositories in your account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-code-repositories is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: CodeRepositorySummaryList

OPTIONS
       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only Git repositories that were created  after
          the specified time.

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only Git repositories that were created before
          the specified time.

       --last-modified-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only Git repositories that were last  modified
          after the specified time.

       --last-modified-time-before (timestamp)
          A  filter that returns only Git repositories that were last modified
          before the specified time.

       --name-contains (string)
          A string in the Git repositories  name.  This  filter  returns  only
          repositories whose name contains the specified string.

       --sort-by (string)
          The field to sort results by. The default is Name .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

          o LastModifiedTime

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for results. The default is Ascending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CodeRepositorySummaryList -> (list)
          Gets a list of summaries of the Git repositories. Each summary spec-
          ifies the following values for the repository:

          o Configuration information,  including  the  URL  location  of  the
            repository  and the ARN of the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager
            secret that contains the credentials used to  access  the  reposi-
            tory.

              CodeRepositoryArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Git repository.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the Git repository was created.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the Git repository was last modified.

              GitConfig -> (structure)
                 Configuration  details  for the Git repository, including the
                 URL where it is located and the ARN of the  Amazon  Web  Ser-
                 vices  Secrets  Manager  secret that contains the credentials
                 used to access the repository.

                 RepositoryUrl -> (string)

                 SecretArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web Services
                     Secrets Manager secret that contains the credentials used
                     to access the git repository.  The  secret  must  have  a
                     staging  label of AWSCURRENT and must be in the following
                     format:
                        {"username": *UserName* , "password": *Password* }

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the result of a ListCodeRepositoriesOutput request was truncated,

          repositories, use the token in the next request.
