LIST-PIPELINE-EXECUTIONS()                          LIST-PIPELINE-EXECUTIONS()



NAME
       list-pipeline-executions -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of the pipeline executions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-pipeline-executions  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: PipelineExecutionSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-pipeline-executions
          --pipeline-name <value>
          [--created-after <value>]
          [--created-before <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pipeline-name (string)
          The name of the pipeline.

       --created-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns the pipeline executions that were created  af-
          ter a specified time.

       --created-before (timestamp)
          A  filter that returns the pipeline executions that were created be-
          fore a specified time.

       --sort-by (string)
          The field by which to sort results. The default is CreatedTime .

          Possible values:

          o CreationTime

          o PipelineExecutionArn

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for results.

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PipelineExecutionSummaries -> (list)
          Contains a sorted list of pipeline execution summary objects  match-
          ing  the specified filters. Each run summary includes the Amazon Re-
          source Name (ARN) of the pipeline execution, the run date,  and  the
          status. This list can be empty.

          (structure)
              A pipeline execution summary.

              PipelineExecutionArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the pipeline execution.

              StartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The start time of the pipeline execution.

              PipelineExecutionStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the pipeline execution.

              PipelineExecutionDescription -> (string)
                 The description of the pipeline execution.

              PipelineExecutionDisplayName -> (string)
                 The display name of the pipeline execution.

              PipelineExecutionFailureReason -> (string)
                 A message generated by SageMaker Pipelines describing why the
                 pipeline execution failed.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the result of the  previous  ListPipelineExecutions  request  was
          truncated,  the response includes a NextToken . To retrieve the next
          set of pipeline executions, use the token in the next request.
