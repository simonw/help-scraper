LIST-NOTEBOOK-INSTANCES()                            LIST-NOTEBOOK-INSTANCES()



NAME
       list-notebook-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of the Amazon SageMaker notebook instances in the re-
       quester's account in an Amazon Web Services Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-notebook-instances is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: NotebookInstances

          o Deleting

       --notebook-instance-lifecycle-config-name-contains (string)
          A string in the name of a notebook instances lifecycle configuration
          associated with this notebook instance.  This  filter  returns  only
          notebook  instances associated with a lifecycle configuration with a
          name that contains the specified string.

       --default-code-repository-contains (string)
          A string in the name or URL of a Git repository associated with this
          notebook instance. This filter returns only notebook instances asso-
          ciated with a git repository with a name that contains the specified
          string.

       --additional-code-repository-equals (string)
          A  filter  that returns only notebook instances with associated with
          the specified git repository.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response to the previous  ListNotebookInstances  request  was

                 URL  of a Git repository in Amazon Web Services CodeCommit or
                 in any other Git repository. When you  open  a  notebook  in-
                 stance,  it opens in the directory that contains this reposi-
                 tory. For more information, see Associating Git  Repositories

                 the same level as the default repository of your notebook in-
                 stance.  For  more information, see Associating Git Reposito-
                 ries with Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instances .
