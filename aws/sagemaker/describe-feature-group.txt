NAME
       describe-feature-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Use  this  operation to describe a FeatureGroup . The response includes
       information on the creation time, FeatureGroup name, the unique identi-
       fier for each FeatureGroup , and more.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-feature-group
          --feature-group-name <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --feature-group-name (string)
          The name of the FeatureGroup you want described.

       --next-token (string)
          A token to resume pagination of the list of Features (FeatureDefini-
          tions ). 2,500 Features are returned by default.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
