LIST-WORKTEAMS()                                              LIST-WORKTEAMS()



NAME
       list-workteams -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  list  of private work teams that you have defined in a region.
       The list may be empty if no work team satisfies the filter specified in
       the NameContains parameter.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-workteams  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Workteams

SYNOPSIS
            list-workteams
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--name-contains <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --sort-by (string)
          The field to sort results by. The default is CreationTime .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreateDate

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for results. The default is Ascending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --name-contains (string)
          A string in the work team's name.  This  filter  returns  only  work
          teams whose name contains the specified string.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Workteams -> (list)
          An array of Workteam objects, each describing a work team.

          (structure)
              Provides details about a labeling work team.

              WorkteamName -> (string)
                 The name of the work team.

              MemberDefinitions -> (list)
                 A list of MemberDefinition objects that contains objects that
                 identify the workers that make up the work team.

                 Workforces  can  be  created using Amazon Cognito or your own
                 OIDC Identity Provider (IdP). For private workforces  created
                 using  Amazon Cognito use CognitoMemberDefinition . For work-
                 forces created using your own OIDC  identity  provider  (IdP)
                 use OidcMemberDefinition .

                 (structure)
                     Defines an Amazon Cognito or your own OIDC IdP user group
                     that is part of a work team.

                     CognitoMemberDefinition -> (structure)
                        The Amazon Cognito user group that is part of the work
                        team.

                            An  identifier for a user pool. The user pool must
                            be in the same region as the service that you  are
                            calling.

                        UserGroup -> (string)
                            An identifier for a user group.

                        ClientId -> (string)
                            An  identifier for an application client. You must
                            create the app client ID using Amazon Cognito.

                     OidcMemberDefinition -> (structure)

                        Provider  (IdP). One to ten groups can be used to cre-
                        ate a single private work team. When you  add  a  user
                        group  to  the  list of Groups , you can add that user
                        group to one or more private work teams. If you add  a
                        user group to a private work team, all workers in that
                        user group are added to the work team.

                        Groups -> (list)
                            A list of comma seperated strings that  identifies
                            user  groups  in your OIDC IdP. Each user group is
                            made up of a group of private workers.

              SubDomain -> (string)
                 The URI of the labeling job's user  interface.  Workers  open
                 this URI to start labeling your data objects.

              CreateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the work team was created (timestamp).

              LastUpdatedDate -> (timestamp)
