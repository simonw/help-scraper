CREATE-LABELING-JOB()                                    CREATE-LABELING-JOB()



NAME
       create-labeling-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a job that uses workers to label the data objects in your input
       dataset. You can use the labeled data to train machine learning models.

       You can select your workforce from one of three providers:

       o A private workforce that you create. It can include  employees,  con-
         tractors,  and outside experts. Use a private workforce when want the
         data to stay within your organization  or  when  a  specific  set  of
         skills is required.

       o One or more vendors that you select from the Amazon Web Services Mar-
         ketplace. Vendors provide expertise in specific areas.

       o The Amazon Mechanical Turk workforce. This is the largest  workforce,
         but  it  should  only  be  used for public data or data that has been
         stripped of any personally identifiable information.

       You can also use automated data labeling to reduce the number  of  data
       objects  that  need  to  be labeled by a human. Automated data labeling
       uses active learning to determine if a data object can  be  labeled  by
       machine  or if it needs to be sent to a human worker. For more informa-
       tion, see Using Automated Data Labeling .

       The data objects to be labeled are contained in an  Amazon  S3  bucket.
       You  create a manifest file that describes the location of each object.
       For more information, see Using Input and Output Data .

       The output can be used as the manifest file for another labeling job or
       as training data for your machine learning models.

       You can use this operation to create a static labeling job or a stream-
       ing labeling job. A static labeling job stops if all  data  objects  in
       the  input manifest file identified in ManifestS3Uri have been labeled.
       A streaming labeling job runs perpetually until it is manually stopped,
       or remains idle for 10 days. You can send new data objects to an active
       (InProgress ) streaming labeling job in real time. To learn how to cre-
       ate  a static labeling job, see Create a Labeling Job (API) in the Ama-
       zon SageMaker Developer Guide. To learn how to create a  streaming  la-
       beling job, see Create a Streaming Labeling Job .

OPTIONS
       --labeling-job-name (string)
          The  name of the labeling job. This name is used to identify the job
          in a list of labeling jobs. Labeling job names must be unique within
          an  Amazon  Web  Services account and region. LabelingJobName is not
          case sensitive. For example, Example-job and example-job are consid-
          ered the same labeling job name by Ground Truth.

       --label-attribute-name (string)
          The attribute name to use for the label in the output manifest file.
          This is the key for the key/value pair formed with the label that  a
          worker  assigns  to the object. The LabelAttributeName must meet the
          following requirements.

          o The name can't end with "-metadata".

          o If you are using one of the following built-in task  types  ,  the
            attribute  name must end with "-ref". If the task type you are us-
            ing is not listed below, the attribute  name  must  not  end  with
            "-ref".

            o Image semantic segmentation (SemanticSegmentation) , and adjust-
              ment (AdjustmentSemanticSegmentation ) and verification (Verifi-
              cationSemanticSegmentation ) labeling jobs for this task type.

            o Video  frame  object  detection (VideoObjectDetection ), and ad-
              justment and verification (AdjustmentVideoObjectDetection )  la-
              beling jobs for this task type.

            o Video  frame object tracking (VideoObjectTracking ), and adjust-
              ment and verification (AdjustmentVideoObjectTracking )  labeling
              jobs for this task type.

            o 3D  point  cloud semantic segmentation (3DPointCloudSemanticSeg-
              mentation ), and adjustment and verification (Adjustment3DPoint-
              CloudSemanticSegmentation ) labeling jobs for this task type.

            o 3D  point  cloud  object tracking (3DPointCloudObjectTracking ),
              and adjustment and  verification  (Adjustment3DPointCloudObject-
              Tracking ) labeling jobs for this task type.

          WARNING:
              If  you are creating an adjustment or verification labeling job,
              you must use a different  LabelAttributeName than the  one  used
              in  the  original labeling job. The original labeling job is the
              Ground Truth labeling job that produced the labels that you want
              verified or adjusted. To learn more about adjustment and verifi-
              cation labeling jobs, see Verify and Adjust Labels .

       --input-config (structure)
          Input data for the labeling job, such as the Amazon S3  location  of
          the  data  objects  and  the  location of the manifest file that de-
          scribes the data objects.

          You must specify at least one of the following: S3DataSource or Sns-
          DataSource .

          o Use  SnsDataSource  to  specify an SNS input topic for a streaming
            labeling job. If you do not  specify  and  SNS  input  topic  ARN,
            Ground  Truth will create a one-time labeling job that stops after
            all data objects in the input manifest file have been labeled.

          o Use S3DataSource to  specify  an  input  manifest  file  for  both
            streaming  and  one-time  labeling jobs. Adding an S3DataSource is
            optional if you use SnsDataSource to create a  streaming  labeling
            job.

          If  you  use  the  Amazon Mechanical Turk workforce, your input data
          should not include confidential information, personal information or
          protected health information. Use ContentClassifiers to specify that
          your data is free of personally identifiable information  and  adult
          content.

          DataSource -> (structure)
              The location of the input data.

              S3DataSource -> (structure)
                 The Amazon S3 location of the input data objects.

                 ManifestS3Uri -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  S3  location  of  the manifest file that de-
                     scribes the input data objects.

                     The input manifest file referenced in ManifestS3Uri  must
                     contain one of the following keys: source-ref or source .
                     The value of the keys are interpreted as follows:

                     o source-ref : The source of the object is the Amazon  S3
                       object  specified in the value. Use this value when the
                       object is a binary object, such as an image.

                     o source : The source of the object  is  the  value.  Use
                       this value when the object is a text value.

                     If  you are a new user of Ground Truth, it is recommended
                     you review Use an Input Manifest File in the Amazon Sage-
                     Maker  Developer  Guide  to  learn how to create an input
                     manifest file.

              SnsDataSource -> (structure)
                 An Amazon SNS data source used for streaming  labeling  jobs.

                 SnsTopicArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  SNS  input topic Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
                     Specify the ARN of the input topic you will use  to  send
                     new data objects to a streaming labeling job.

          DataAttributes -> (structure)
              Attributes of the data specified by the customer.

              ContentClassifiers -> (list)
                 Declares that your content is free of personally identifiable
                 information or adult content. Amazon SageMaker  may  restrict
                 the  Amazon  Mechanical  Turk workers that can view your task
                 based on this information.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DataSource={S3DataSource={ManifestS3Uri=string},SnsDataSource={SnsTopicArn=string}},DataAttributes={ContentClassifiers=[string,string]}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DataSource": {
              "S3DataSource": {
                "ManifestS3Uri": "string"
              },
              "SnsDataSource": {
                "SnsTopicArn": "string"
              }
            },
            "DataAttributes": {
              "ContentClassifiers": ["FreeOfPersonallyIdentifiableInformation"|"FreeOfAdultContent", ...]
            }
          }

       --output-config (structure)
          The location of the output data and the Amazon Web Services Key Man-
          agement  Service key ID for the key used to encrypt the output data,
          if any.

          S3OutputPath -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 location to write output data.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services Key Management Service  ID  of  the  key
              used to encrypt the output data, if any.

              If  you  provide  your own KMS key ID, you must add the required
              permissions to your KMS key described in Encrypt Output Data and
              Storage Volume with Amazon Web Services KMS .

              If you don't provide a KMS key ID, Amazon SageMaker uses the de-
              fault Amazon Web Services KMS key for Amazon S3 for your  role's
              account to encrypt your output data.

              If  you use a bucket policy with an s3:PutObject permission that
              only allows objects with server-side encryption, set the  condi-
              tion  key  of s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption to "aws:kms" . For
              more information, see KMS-Managed Encryption Keys in the  Amazon
              Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.

          SnsTopicArn -> (string)
              An  Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) output topic
              ARN. Provide a SnsTopicArn if you want to do real time  chaining
              to another streaming job and receive an Amazon SNS notifications
              each time a data object is submitted by a worker.

              If you provide an SnsTopicArn in  OutputConfig  ,  when  workers
              complete  labeling  tasks,  Ground Truth will send labeling task
              output data to the SNS output topic you specify here.

              To learn more, see Receive Output Data from a Streaming Labeling
              Job .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3OutputPath=string,KmsKeyId=string,SnsTopicArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

            "S3OutputPath": "string",
            "KmsKeyId": "string",
            "SnsTopicArn": "string"
          }

       --role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Number (ARN) that Amazon SageMaker assumes to
          perform tasks on your behalf during data labeling.  You  must  grant
          this  role  the  necessary  permissions so that Amazon SageMaker can
          successfully complete data labeling.

       --label-category-config-s3-uri (string)
          The S3 URI of the file, referred to as a label  category  configura-
          tion  file  , that defines the categories used to label the data ob-
          jects.

          For 3D point cloud and video frame task types,  you  can  add  label
          category attributes and frame attributes to your label category con-
          figuration file. To learn how, see Create a Labeling  Category  Con-
          figuration File for 3D Point Cloud Labeling Jobs .

          For  named  entity  recognition  jobs, in addition to "labels" , you
          must provide worker instructions in the label category configuration
          file  using the "instructions" parameter: "instructions": {"shortIn-
          struction":"<h1>Add       header</h1><p>Add       Instructions</p>",
          "fullInstruction":"<p>Add  additional  instructions.</p>"} . For de-
          tails and an example, see Create a Named Entity Recognition Labeling
          Job (API) .

          For all other built-in task types and custom tasks , your label cat-
          egory configuration file must be a JSON file in the  following  for-
          mat.  Identify the labels you want to use by replacing label_1 , la-
          bel_2 ,``...`` ,``label_n`` with your label categories.
              {

              "document-version": "2018-11-28",

              "labels":  [{"label":  "label_1"},{"label":  "label_2"},...{"la-
              bel": "label_n"}]

              }

          Note the following about the label category configuration file:

          o For  image  classification  and  text  classification  (single and
            multi-label) you must specify at least two label  categories.  For
            all  other  task types, the minimum number of label categories re-
            quired is one.

          o Each label category must be unique, you cannot  specify  duplicate
            label categories.

          o If  you create a 3D point cloud or video frame adjustment or veri-
            fication labeling job, you must include auditLabelAttributeName in
            the  label category configuration. Use this parameter to enter the
            `                                               LabelAttributeName
            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateLabelingJob.html#sagemaker-CreateLabelingJob-request-LabelAttributeName`__
            of the labeling job you want to adjust or verify annotations of.

       --stopping-conditions (structure)
          A set of conditions for stopping the labeling job.  If  any  of  the
          conditions  are  met,  the job is automatically stopped. You can use
          these conditions to control the cost of data labeling.

          MaxHumanLabeledObjectCount -> (integer)
              The maximum number of objects that can be labeled by human work-
              ers.

          MaxPercentageOfInputDatasetLabeled -> (integer)
              The maximum number of input data objects that should be labeled.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MaxHumanLabeledObjectCount=integer,MaxPercentageOfInputDatasetLabeled=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MaxHumanLabeledObjectCount": integer,
            "MaxPercentageOfInputDatasetLabeled": integer
          }

       --labeling-job-algorithms-config (structure)
          Configures the information required to perform automated data label-
          ing.

          LabelingJobAlgorithmSpecificationArn -> (string)
              Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  algorithm  used
              for auto-labeling. You must select one of the following ARNs:

          InitialActiveLearningModelArn -> (string)
              At  the  end  of an auto-label job Ground Truth sends the Amazon
              Resource Name (ARN) of the final model used  for  auto-labeling.
              You can use this model as the starting point for subsequent sim-
              ilar jobs by providing the ARN of the model here.

          LabelingJobResourceConfig -> (structure)
              Provides configuration information for a labeling job.

              VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Key Management  Service  (Amazon  Web
                 Services  KMS) key that Amazon SageMaker uses to encrypt data
                 on the storage volume attached to the ML compute  instance(s)
                 that  run  the training and inference jobs used for automated
                 data labeling.

                 You can only specify a VolumeKmsKeyId when you create  a  la-
                 beling job with automated data labeling enabled using the API
                 operation CreateLabelingJob . You cannot  specify  an  Amazon
                 Web  Services  KMS key to encrypt the storage volume used for
                 automated data labeling model training and inference when you
                 create  a  labeling job using the console. To learn more, see
                 Output Data and Storage Volume Encryption .

                 The VolumeKmsKeyId can be any of the following formats:

                 o KMS Key ID  "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                 o Amazon   Resource    Name    (ARN)    of    a    KMS    Key
                   "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                 named entity recognition, 3D point cloud and video frame  la-
                 beling jobs. Use your labeling job task type to select one of
                 the following ARNs and use it with this  parameter  when  you
                 create a labeling job. Replace aws-region with the Amazon Web
                 Services Region you are creating your labeling  job  in.  For
                 example,  replace  aws-region  with us-west-1 if you create a
                 labeling job in US West (N. California).

          TaskKeywords -> (list)
              Keywords used to describe the task so that workers on Amazon Me-
              chanical Turk can discover the task.

              (string)

          TaskTitle -> (string)
              A title for the task for your human workers.

          TaskDescription -> (string)
              A description of the task for your human workers.

          NumberOfHumanWorkersPerDataObject -> (integer)
              The number of human workers that will label an object.

          TaskTimeLimitInSeconds -> (integer)
              The amount of time that a worker has to complete a task.

              If you create a custom labeling job, the maximum value for  this
              parameter is 8 hours (28,800 seconds).

              If you create a labeling job using a built-in task type the max-
              imum for this parameter depends on the task type you use:

              o For image and text labeling  jobs,  the  maximum  is  8  hours
                (28,800 seconds).

              o For  3D point cloud and video frame labeling jobs, the maximum
                is 30 days (2952,000 seconds) for non-AL mode. For most users,
                the maximum is also 30 days.

          TaskAvailabilityLifetimeInSeconds -> (integer)
              The length of time that a task remains available for labeling by
              human workers. The default and maximum values for this parameter
              depend on the type of workforce you use.

              o If  you choose the Amazon Mechanical Turk workforce, the maxi-
                mum is 12 hours (43,200  seconds).  The  default  is  6  hours
                (21,600 seconds).

              o If you choose a private or vendor workforce, the default value
                is 30 days (2592,000 seconds) for non-AL mode. For most users,
                the maximum is also 30 days.

          MaxConcurrentTaskCount -> (integer)
              Defines  the  maximum number of data objects that can be labeled
              by human workers at the same time. Also  referred  to  as  batch
              size. Each object may have more than one worker at one time. The
              default value is 1000 objects.

          AnnotationConsolidationConfig -> (structure)
              Configures how labels are consolidated across human workers.

              AnnotationConsolidationLambdaArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a  Lambda  function  imple-
                 ments  the  logic for annotation consolidation and to process
                 output data.

                 This  parameter  is  required  for  all  labeling  jobs.  For
                 built-in  task  types , use one of the following Amazon Sage-
                 Maker Ground Truth Lambda function ARNs for AnnotationConsol-
                 idationLambdaArn   .   For  custom  labeling  workflows,  see
                 Post-annotation Lambda .

          Allocation  Tags in the Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost Manage-
          ment User Guide .

          (structure)
              A tag object that consists of a key and an optional value,  used
              to manage metadata for SageMaker Amazon Web Services resources.

              You  can add tags to notebook instances, training jobs, hyperpa-
              rameter tuning jobs,  batch  transform  jobs,  models,  labeling
              jobs,  work  teams,  endpoint configurations, and endpoints. For
              more information on adding tags to SageMaker resources, see  Ad-
              dTags .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
