SEARCH()                                                              SEARCH()



NAME
       search -

DESCRIPTION
       Finds  Amazon  SageMaker  resources that match a search query. Matching
       resources are returned as a list of SearchRecord  objects  in  the  re-
       sponse.  You  can sort the search results by any resource property in a
       ascending or descending order.

       You can query against the following value types: numeric,  text,  Bool-
       ean, and timestamp.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       search  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation  by  providing  the --no-paginate argument.  When using --output
       text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query  ar-
       gument  must  extract  data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Results

       --search-expression (structure)
          A Boolean conditional statement. Resources must satisfy this  condi-
          tion to be included in search results. You must provide at least one
          subexpression, filter, or nested filter. The maximum number  of  re-
          cursive SubExpressions , NestedFilters , and Filters that can be in-
          cluded in a SearchExpression object is 50.

          Filters -> (list)
              A list of filter objects.

              (structure)
                 A conditional statement for a search expression that includes
                 a  resource  property,  a  Boolean operator, and a value. Re-
                 sources that match the statement are returned in the  results
                 from the  Search API.

                 If  you  specify a Value , but not an Operator , Amazon Sage-
                 Maker uses the equals operator.

                 In search, there are several property types:
                     Metrics

                 To define a metric filter, enter a value using the form "Met-
                 rics.<name>"  ,  where  <name> is a metric name. For example,
                 the following filter searches for training jobs with an  "ac-
                 curacy" metric greater than "0.9" :
                     {

                     "Name": "Metrics.accuracy",

                     "Operator": "GreaterThan",

                     "Value": "0.9"

                     }
                        HyperParameters

                 To  define  a  hyperparameter  filter, enter a value with the
                 form "HyperParameters.<name>" . Decimal hyperparameter values
                 are  treated  as  a  decimal in a comparison if the specified
                 Value is also a decimal value. If the specified Value  is  an
                 integer, the decimal hyperparameter values are treated as in-
                 tegers. For example, the following  filter  is  satisfied  by
                 training  jobs  with a "learning_rate" hyperparameter that is
                 less than "0.5" :
                     {

                     "Name": "HyperParameters.learning_rate",

                     "Operator": "LessThan",

                     "Value": "0.5"

                     }
                        Tags

                 To  define  a  tag  filter,  enter  a  value  with  the  form
                 Tags.<key> .

                 Name -> (string)
                     A  resource property name. For example, TrainingJobName .
                     For valid property names, see  SearchRecord  .  You  must
                     specify a valid property for the resource.

                 Operator -> (string)
                     A  Boolean  binary  operator that is used to evaluate the
                     filter. The operator field contains one of the  following
                     values:
                        Equals

                     The value of Name equals Value .
                        NotEquals

                     The value of Name doesn't equal Value .
                        Exists

                     The Name property exists.
                        NotExists

                     The Name property does not exist.
                        GreaterThan

                     The  value  of Name is greater than Value . Not supported
                     for text properties.
                        GreaterThanOrEqualTo

                     The value of Name is greater than or equal to Value . Not
                     supported for text properties.
                        LessThan

                     The  value of Name is less than Value . Not supported for
                     text properties.
                        LessThanOrEqualTo

                     The value of Name is less than or equal to  Value  .  Not
                     supported for text properties.
                        In

                     The  value  of Name is one of the comma delimited strings
                     in Value . Only supported for text properties.
                        Contains

                     The value of Name contains the string Value .  Only  sup-
                     ported for text properties.

                     A SearchExpression can include the Contains operator mul-
                     tiple times when the value of Name is one of the  follow-
                     ing:

                     o Experiment.DisplayName

                     o Experiment.ExperimentName

                     o Experiment.Tags

                     o Trial.DisplayName

                     o Trial.TrialName

                     o Trial.Tags

                     o TrialComponent.DisplayName

                     o TrialComponent.TrialComponentName

                     o TrialComponent.Tags

                     o TrialComponent.InputArtifacts

                     o TrialComponent.OutputArtifacts

                     A SearchExpression can include only one Contains operator
                     for all other values of Name . In these cases, if you in-
                     clude multiple Contains operators in the SearchExpression
                     , the result is the following error message:  "'CONTAINS'
                     operator usage limit of 1 exceeded. "

                 Value -> (string)
                     A  value  used  with Name and Operator to determine which
                     resources satisfy the filter's condition.  For  numerical
                     properties,  Value  must  be an integer or floating-point
                     decimal. For timestamp properties, Value must be  an  ISO
                     8601   date-time   string   of   the   following  format:
                     YYYY-mm-dd'T'HH:MM:SS .

          NestedFilters -> (list)
              A list of nested filter objects.

              (structure)
                 A list of nested  Filter objects. A resource must satisfy the
                 conditions  of  all filters to be included in the results re-
                 turned from the  Search API.

                 For example, to filter on a  training  job's  InputDataConfig
                 property  with  a specific channel name and S3Uri prefix, de-
                 fine the following filters:

                 o '{Name:"InputDataConfig.ChannelName",  "Operator":"Equals",
                   "Value":"train"}',

                 o '{Name:"InputDataConfig.DataSource.S3DataSource.S3Uri",
                   "Operator":"Contains", "Value":"mybucket/catdata"}'

                 NestedPropertyName -> (string)
                     The name of the property to use in  the  nested  filters.
                     The  value must match a listed property name, such as In-
                     putDataConfig .

                 Filters -> (list)
                     A list of filters. Each filter acts on a  property.  Fil-
                     ters  must  contain at least one Filters value. For exam-
                     ple, a NestedFilters call might include a filter  on  the
                     PropertyName  parameter  of the InputDataConfig property:
                     InputDataConfig.DataSource.S3DataSource.S3Uri .

                     (structure)
                        A conditional statement for a search  expression  that
                        includes  a resource property, a Boolean operator, and
                        a value. Resources that match the  statement  are  re-
                        turned in the results from the  Search API.

                        If  you specify a Value , but not an Operator , Amazon
                        SageMaker uses the equals operator.

                        In search, there are several property types:
                            Metrics

                        To define a metric filter, enter  a  value  using  the
                        form "Metrics.<name>" , where <name> is a metric name.
                        For example, the following filter searches for  train-
                        ing  jobs with an "accuracy" metric greater than "0.9"
                        :
                            {

                            "Name": "Metrics.accuracy",

                            "Operator": "GreaterThan",

                            "Value": "0.9"

                            }
                               HyperParameters

                        To define a hyperparameter filter, enter a value  with
                        the  form  "HyperParameters.<name>" . Decimal hyperpa-
                        rameter values are treated as a decimal in a  compari-
                        son if the specified Value is also a decimal value. If
                        the specified Value is an integer, the decimal  hyper-
                        parameter values are treated as integers. For example,
                        the following filter is  satisfied  by  training  jobs
                        with  a  "learning_rate"  hyperparameter  that is less
                        than "0.5" :
                            {

                            "Name": "HyperParameters.learning_rate",

                            "Operator": "LessThan",

                            "Value": "0.5"

                            }
                               Tags

                        To define a tag filter, enter a value  with  the  form
                        Tags.<key> .

                        Name -> (string)
                            A  resource  property  name.  For  example, Train-
                            ingJobName  .  For  valid  property   names,   see
                            SearchRecord  .  You must specify a valid property
                            for the resource.

                        Operator -> (string)
                            A Boolean binary operator that is used to evaluate
                            the filter. The operator field contains one of the
                            following values:
                               Equals

                            The value of Name equals Value .
                               NotEquals

                            The value of Name doesn't equal Value .
                               Exists

                            The Name property exists.
                               NotExists

                            The Name property does not exist.
                               GreaterThan

                            The value of Name is greater than Value . Not sup-
                            ported for text properties.
                               GreaterThanOrEqualTo

                            The  value  of  Name  is  greater than or equal to
                            Value . Not supported for text properties.
                               LessThan

                            The value of Name is less than Value  .  Not  sup-
                            ported for text properties.
                               LessThanOrEqualTo

                            The value of Name is less than or equal to Value .
                            Not supported for text properties.
                               In

                            The value of Name is one of  the  comma  delimited
                            strings in Value . Only supported for text proper-
                            ties.
                               Contains

                            The value of Name contains the string Value . Only
                            supported for text properties.

                            A SearchExpression can include the Contains opera-
                            tor multiple times when the value of Name  is  one
                            of the following:

                            o Experiment.DisplayName

                            o Experiment.ExperimentName

                            o Experiment.Tags

                            o TrialComponent.OutputArtifacts

                            A  SearchExpression  can include only one Contains
                            operator for all other values of Name .  In  these
                            cases,  if you include multiple Contains operators
                            in the SearchExpression , the result is  the  fol-
                            lowing  error  message: "'CONTAINS' operator usage
                            limit of 1 exceeded. "

                        Value -> (string)
                            A value used with Name and Operator  to  determine
                            which  resources  satisfy  the filter's condition.
                            For numerical properties, Value must be an integer
                            or  floating-point  decimal. For timestamp proper-
                            ties, Value must be an ISO 8601  date-time  string
                            of the following format: YYYY-mm-dd'T'HH:MM:SS .

          SubExpressions -> (list)
              A list of search expression objects.

              (structure)
                 A  multi-expression  that searches for the specified resource
                 or resources in a search. All resource objects  that  satisfy
                 the  expression's  condition  are  included in the search re-
                 sults. You must specify at least one  subexpression,  filter,
                 or nested filter. A SearchExpression can contain up to twenty
                 elements.

                 A SearchExpression contains the following components:

                 o A list of Filter objects.  Each  filter  defines  a  simple
                   Boolean  expression  comprised of a resource property name,
                   Boolean operator, and value.

                 o A list of NestedFilter objects. Each nested filter  defines
                   a  list  of  Boolean  expressions  using a list of resource
                   properties. A nested filter is satisfied if a single object
                   in the list satisfies all Boolean expressions.

                 o A list of SearchExpression objects. A search expression ob-
                   ject can be nested in a list of search expression objects.

                 o A Boolean operator: And or Or .

                 Filters -> (list)
                     A list of filter objects.

                     (structure)
                        A conditional statement for a search  expression  that
                        includes  a resource property, a Boolean operator, and
                        a value. Resources that match the  statement  are  re-
                        turned in the results from the  Search API.

                        If  you specify a Value , but not an Operator , Amazon
                        SageMaker uses the equals operator.

                        In search, there are several property types:
                            Metrics

                        To define a metric filter, enter  a  value  using  the
                        form "Metrics.<name>" , where <name> is a metric name.
                        For example, the following filter searches for  train-
                        ing  jobs with an "accuracy" metric greater than "0.9"
                        :
                            {

                            "Name": "Metrics.accuracy",

                            "Operator": "GreaterThan",

                            "Value": "0.9"

                            }
                               HyperParameters

                        To define a hyperparameter filter, enter a value  with
                        the  form  "HyperParameters.<name>" . Decimal hyperpa-
                        rameter values are treated as a decimal in a  compari-
                        son if the specified Value is also a decimal value. If
                        the specified Value is an integer, the decimal  hyper-
                        parameter values are treated as integers. For example,
                        the following filter is  satisfied  by  training  jobs
                        with  a  "learning_rate"  hyperparameter  that is less
                        than "0.5" :
                            {

                            "Name": "HyperParameters.learning_rate",

                            "Operator": "LessThan",

                            "Value": "0.5"

                            }
                               Tags

                        To define a tag filter, enter a value  with  the  form
                        Tags.<key> .

                        Name -> (string)
                            A  resource  property  name.  For  example, Train-
                            ingJobName  .  For  valid  property   names,   see
                            SearchRecord  .  You must specify a valid property
                            for the resource.

                        Operator -> (string)
                            A Boolean binary operator that is used to evaluate
                            the filter. The operator field contains one of the
                            following values:
                               Equals

                            The value of Name equals Value .
                               NotEquals

                            The value of Name doesn't equal Value .
                               Exists

                            The Name property exists.
                               NotExists

                            The Name property does not exist.
                               GreaterThan

                            The value of Name is greater than Value . Not sup-
                            ported for text properties.
                               GreaterThanOrEqualTo

                            The  value  of  Name  is  greater than or equal to
                            Value . Not supported for text properties.
                               LessThan

                            The value of Name is less than Value  .  Not  sup-
                            ported for text properties.
                               LessThanOrEqualTo

                            The value of Name is less than or equal to Value .
                            Not supported for text properties.
                               In

                            The value of Name is one of  the  comma  delimited
                            strings in Value . Only supported for text proper-
                            ties.
                               Contains

                            The value of Name contains the string Value . Only
                            supported for text properties.

                            A SearchExpression can include the Contains opera-
                            tor multiple times when the value of Name  is  one
                            of the following:

                            o Experiment.DisplayName

                            o Experiment.ExperimentName

                            o Experiment.Tags

                            o Trial.DisplayName

                            o Trial.TrialName

                            o Trial.Tags

                            o TrialComponent.DisplayName

                            o TrialComponent.TrialComponentName

                            o TrialComponent.Tags

                            o TrialComponent.InputArtifacts

                            o TrialComponent.OutputArtifacts

                            A  SearchExpression  can include only one Contains
                            operator for all other values of Name .  In  these
                            cases,  if you include multiple Contains operators
                            in the SearchExpression , the result is  the  fol-
                            lowing  error  message: "'CONTAINS' operator usage
                            limit of 1 exceeded. "

                        Value -> (string)
                            A value used with Name and Operator  to  determine
                            which  resources  satisfy  the filter's condition.
                            For numerical properties, Value must be an integer
                            or  floating-point  decimal. For timestamp proper-
                            ties, Value must be an ISO 8601  date-time  string
                            of the following format: YYYY-mm-dd'T'HH:MM:SS .

                 NestedFilters -> (list)
                     A list of nested filter objects.

                     (structure)
                        A list of nested  Filter objects. A resource must sat-
                        isfy the conditions of all filters to be  included  in
                        the results returned from the  Search API.

                        For  example, to filter on a training job's InputData-
                        Config property with a specific channel name and S3Uri
                        prefix, define the following filters:

                        o '{Name:"InputDataConfig.ChannelName",        "Opera-
                          tor":"Equals", "Value":"train"}',

                        o '{Name:"InputDataConfig.DataSource.S3Data-
                          Source.S3Uri",  "Operator":"Contains",  "Value":"my-
                          bucket/catdata"}'

                        NestedPropertyName -> (string)
                            The name of the property to use in the nested fil-
                            ters. The value must match a listed property name,
                            such as InputDataConfig .

                        Filters -> (list)
                            A list of filters. Each filter acts on a property.
                            Filters  must  contain at least one Filters value.
                            For example, a NestedFilters call might include  a
                            filter on the PropertyName parameter of the Input-
                            DataConfig     property:     InputDataConfig.Data-
                            Source.S3DataSource.S3Uri .

                            (structure)
                               A conditional statement for a search expression
                               that includes a resource  property,  a  Boolean
                               operator, and a value. Resources that match the
                               statement are returned in the results from  the
                               Search API.

                               If  you specify a Value , but not an Operator ,
                               Amazon SageMaker uses the equals operator.

                               In search, there are several property types:
                                   Metrics

                               To define a metric filter, enter a value  using
                               the  form  "Metrics.<name>" , where <name> is a
                               metric name. For example, the following  filter
                               searches  for  training jobs with an "accuracy"
                               metric greater than "0.9" :
                                   {

                                   "Name": "Metrics.accuracy",

                                   "Operator": "GreaterThan",

                                   "Value": "0.9"

                                   }
                                      HyperParameters

                               To define  a  hyperparameter  filter,  enter  a
                               value  with the form "HyperParameters.<name>" .
                               Decimal hyperparameter values are treated as  a
                               decimal  in a comparison if the specified Value
                               is also a decimal value. If the specified Value
                               is  an integer, the decimal hyperparameter val-
                               ues are treated as integers. For  example,  the
                               following  filter is satisfied by training jobs
                               with a "learning_rate" hyperparameter  that  is
                               less than "0.5" :
                                   {

                                   "Name": "HyperParameters.learning_rate",

                                   "Operator": "LessThan",

                                   "Value": "0.5"

                                   }
                                      Tags

                               To  define a tag filter, enter a value with the
                               form Tags.<key> .

                               Name -> (string)
                                   A  resource  property  name.  For  example,
                                   TrainingJobName . For valid property names,
                                   see  SearchRecord  .  You  must  specify  a
                                   valid property for the resource.

                               Operator -> (string)
                                   A  Boolean  binary operator that is used to
                                   evaluate the  filter.  The  operator  field
                                   contains one of the following values:
                                      Equals

                                   The value of Name equals Value .
                                      NotEquals

                                   The value of Name doesn't equal Value .
                                      Exists

                                   The Name property exists.
                                      NotExists

                                   The Name property does not exist.
                                      GreaterThan

                                   The  value  of Name is greater than Value .
                                   Not supported for text properties.
                                      GreaterThanOrEqualTo

                                   The value of Name is greater than or  equal
                                   to  Value  . Not supported for text proper-
                                   ties.
                                      LessThan

                                   The value of Name is less than Value .  Not
                                   supported for text properties.
                                      LessThanOrEqualTo

                                   The  value of Name is less than or equal to
                                   Value . Not supported for text properties.
                                      In

       --sort-by (string)
          The  name  of the resource property used to sort the SearchResults .
          The default is LastModifiedTime .

       --sort-order (string)
          How SearchResults are ordered. Valid values  are  Ascending  or  De-
          scending . The default is Descending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                        Provided by Amazon SageMaker: Common Parameters . Ama-
                        zon  SageMaker supports both registry/repository[:tag]
                        and registry/repository[@digest] image  path  formats.

                        with Amazon SageMaker .

                     AlgorithmName -> (string)
                        The name of the algorithm  resource  to  use  for  the
                        training  job. This must be an algorithm resource that
                        you created or subscribe to  on  Amazon  Web  Services
                        Marketplace.  If  you specify a value for this parame-
                        ter, you can't specify a value for TrainingImage .

                     TrainingInputMode -> (string)
                        The training input mode that the  algorithm  supports.

                        .
                            Pipe mode

                        If an algorithm supports Pipe mode,  Amazon  SageMaker
                        streams data directly from Amazon S3 to the container.
                            File mode

                        If  an  algorithm  supports File mode, SageMaker down-
                        loads the training data from S3 to the provisioned  ML
                        storage volume, and mounts the directory to the Docker
                        volume for the training container.

                        You must provision the ML storage volume  with  suffi-
                        cient capacity to accommodate the data downloaded from
                        S3. In addition to the training data, the  ML  storage
                        volume  also  stores  the  output model. The algorithm
                        container uses the ML storage volume to also store in-
                        termediate information, if any.

                        For  distributed algorithms, training data is distrib-
                        uted uniformly. Your training duration is  predictable
                        if  the input data objects sizes are approximately the
                        same. SageMaker does not split the files  any  further
                        for  model  training.  If the object sizes are skewed,
                        training won't be optimal as the data distribution  is
                        also  skewed  when  one  host in a training cluster is
                        overloaded, thus becoming a bottleneck in training.

                        If an  algorithm  supports  FastFile  mode,  SageMaker
                        streams data directly from S3 to the container with no
                        code changes, and provides file system access  to  the
                        data. Users can author their training script to inter-
                        act with these files as if they were stored on disk.
                            FastFile mode works best when the data is read se-
                            quentially.  Augmented  manifest files aren't sup-
                            ported. The startup time is lower when  there  are
                            fewer files in the S3 bucket provided.

                     MetricDefinitions -> (list)
                        A list of metric definition objects. Each object spec-
                        ifies the metric name and regular expressions used  to
                        parse  algorithm logs. Amazon SageMaker publishes each
                        metric to Amazon CloudWatch.

                        (structure)
                            Specifies a metric  that  the  training  algorithm
                            writes  to  stderr or stdout . Amazon SageMakerhy-
                            perparameter tuning captures all defined  metrics.
                            You  specify one metric that a hyperparameter tun-
                            ing job uses as its objective metric to choose the
                            best training job.

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the metric.

                            Regex -> (string)
                               A  regular  expression that searches the output
                               of a training job and gets  the  value  of  the
                               metric.  For more information about using regu-
                               lar expressions to define metrics, see Defining
                               Objective Metrics .

                     EnableSageMakerMetricsTimeSeries -> (boolean)
                        To generate and save time-series metrics during train-
                        ing, set to true . The default is false  and  time-se-
                        ries  metrics aren't generated except in the following
                        cases:

                        o You use one of the Amazon SageMaker  built-in  algo-
                          rithms

                        o You  use  one of the following Prebuilt Amazon Sage-
                          Maker Docker Images :

                          o Tensorflow (version >= 1.15)

                          o MXNet (version >= 1.6)

                          o PyTorch (version >= 1.3)

                        o You specify at least one  MetricDefinition

                 RoleArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Web Services Identity  and  Access  Management
                     (IAM) role configured for the training job.

                 InputDataConfig -> (list)
                     An  array of Channel objects that describes each data in-
                     put channel.

                     (structure)
                        A channel is a named input source that training  algo-
                        rithms can consume.

                        ChannelName -> (string)
                            The name of the channel.

                        DataSource -> (structure)
                            The location of the channel data.

                            S3DataSource -> (structure)
                               The  S3 location of the data source that is as-
                               sociated with a channel.

                               S3DataType -> (string)
                                   If you choose S3Prefix , S3Uri identifies a
                                   key  name prefix. Amazon SageMaker uses all
                                   objects that match the specified  key  name
                                   prefix for model training.

                                   If  you choose ManifestFile , S3Uri identi-
                                   fies an object that is a manifest file con-
                                   taining a list of object keys that you want
                                   Amazon SageMaker to use for model training.

                                   If you choose AugmentedManifestFile , S3Uri
                                   identifies  an  object that is an augmented
                                   manifest file in JSON  lines  format.  This
                                   file  contains the data you want to use for
                                   model training.  AugmentedManifestFile  can
                                   only be used if the Channel's input mode is
                                   Pipe .

                               S3Uri -> (string)
                                   Depending on the value  specified  for  the
                                   S3DataType  ,  identifies either a key name
                                   prefix or a manifest. For example:

                                   o A key name prefix might look  like  this:
                                     s3://bucketname/exampleprefix

                                   o A   manifest   might   look   like  this:
                                     s3://bucketname/example.manifest   A man-
                                     ifest  is  an  S3  object which is a JSON
                                     file consisting of an array of  elements.
                                     The  first  element  is a prefix which is
                                     followed by one or more  suffixes.  Sage-
                                     Maker  appends the suffix elements to the
                                     prefix to get a full set of S3Uri .  Note
                                     that the prefix must be a valid non-empty
                                     S3Uri that precludes users from  specify-
                                     ing  a manifest whose individual S3Uri is
                                     sourced from different  S3  buckets.  The
                                     following code example shows a valid man-
                                     ifest format:   [  {"prefix":  "s3://cus-

                                     tive/path/custdata-N"    ]   This JSON is
                                     equivalent  to  the following S3Uri list:
                                     s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/rela-
                                     tive/path/to/custdata-1         s3://cus-

                                     tive/path/custdata-N    The  complete set
                                     of S3Uri in this manifest  is  the  input
                                     data   for  the  channel  for  this  data
                                     source. The object that each S3Uri points
                                     to  must be readable by the IAM role that
                                     Amazon SageMaker uses to perform tasks on
                                     your behalf.

                               S3DataDistributionType -> (string)
                                   If  you  want Amazon SageMaker to replicate
                                   the entire dataset on each ML  compute  in-
                                   stance that is launched for model training,
                                   specify FullyReplicated .

                                   If you want Amazon SageMaker to replicate a
                                   subset  of data on each ML compute instance
                                   that is launched for model training,  spec-
                                   ify ShardedByS3Key . If there are n ML com-
                                   pute instances launched for a training job,
                                   each instance gets approximately 1/n of the
                                   number of S3 objects. In this  case,  model
                                   training on each machine uses only the sub-
                                   set of training data.

                                   Don't choose more ML compute instances  for
                                   training  than available S3 objects. If you
                                   do, some nodes won't get any data  and  you
                                   will  pay for nodes that aren't getting any
                                   training data. This applies  in  both  File
                                   and  Pipe modes. Keep this in mind when de-
                                   veloping algorithms.

                                   In distributed training, where you use mul-
                                   tiple  ML  compute EC2 instances, you might
                                   choose ShardedByS3Key .  If  the  algorithm
                                   requires  copying  training  data to the ML
                                   storage volume (when  TrainingInputMode  is
                                   set  to File ), this copies 1/n of the num-
                                   ber of objects.

                               AttributeNames -> (list)
                                   A list of one or more  attribute  names  to
                                   use that are found in a specified augmented
                                   manifest file.

                                   (string)

                            FileSystemDataSource -> (structure)
                               The file system that is associated with a chan-
                               nel.

                               FileSystemId -> (string)
                                   The file system id.

                               FileSystemAccessMode -> (string)
                                   The  access mode of the mount of the direc-
                                   tory associated with the channel. A  direc-
                                   tory   can   be   mounted   either   in  ro
                                   (read-only) or rw (read-write) mode.

                               FileSystemType -> (string)
                                   The file system type.

                               DirectoryPath -> (string)
                                   The full path to the directory to associate
                                   with the channel.

                        ContentType -> (string)
                            The MIME type of the data.

                        CompressionType -> (string)
                            If  training  data  is compressed, the compression
                            type. The default value is None .  CompressionType
                            is  used  only  in  Pipe input mode. In File mode,
                            leave this field unset or set it to None.

                        RecordWrapperType -> (string)
                            Specify RecordIO as the value when input  data  is
                            in  raw format but the training algorithm requires
                            the RecordIO format. In this  case,  Amazon  Sage-
                            Maker  wraps each individual S3 object in a Recor-
                            dIO record. If the input data is already in Recor-
                            dIO  format, you don't need to set this attribute.

                            RecordIO .

                            In  File mode, leave this field unset or set it to
                            None.

                        InputMode -> (string)
                            (Optional) The input mode  to  use  for  the  data
                            channel  in  a  training  job.  If you don't set a
                            value for InputMode , Amazon  SageMaker  uses  the
                            value set for TrainingInputMode . Use this parame-
                            ter to override the TrainingInputMode setting in a
                            AlgorithmSpecification  request  when  you  have a
                            channel that needs a different input mode from the
                            training  job's  general  setting. To download the
                            data from Amazon Simple  Storage  Service  (Amazon
                            S3)  to  the  provisioned  ML  storage volume, and
                            mount the directory to a Docker volume,  use  File
                            input mode. To stream data directly from Amazon S3
                            to the container, choose Pipe input mode.

                            To use a model for  incremental  training,  choose
                            File input model.

                            A  configuration  for  a  shuffle option for input
                            data  in  a  channel.  If  you  use  S3Prefix  for
                            S3DataType  ,  this shuffles the results of the S3
                            key prefix matches. If you use ManifestFile ,  the
                            order of the S3 object references in the Manifest-
                            File is shuffled. If you use AugmentedManifestFile
                            , the order of the JSON lines in the AugmentedMan-
                            ifestFile is shuffled. The shuffling order is  de-
                            termined using the Seed value.

                            For  Pipe  input  mode,  shuffling  is done at the
                            start of every epoch. With large datasets this en-
                            sures  that the order of the training data is dif-
                            ferent for each epoch, it helps  reduce  bias  and
                            possible overfitting. In a multi-node training job
                            when ShuffleConfig is combined with  S3DataDistri-
                            butionType  of  ShardedByS3Key , the data is shuf-
                            fled across nodes so that the content  sent  to  a
                            particular  node  on the first epoch might be sent
                            to a different node on the second epoch.

                            Seed -> (long)
                               Determines the shuffling order in ShuffleConfig
                               value.

                 OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
                     The  S3  path  where  model artifacts that you configured
                     when creating the job are stored. Amazon  SageMaker  cre-
                     ates subfolders for model artifacts.

                     KmsKeyId -> (string)
                        The Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon
                        Web Services KMS) key that Amazon  SageMaker  uses  to
                        encrypt  the  model  artifacts at rest using Amazon S3
                        server-side encryption. The KmsKeyId can be any of the
                        following formats:

                        o //              KMS              Key              ID
                          "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                        o //  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  a   KMS   Key
                          "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                        o // KMS Key Alias  "alias/ExampleAlias"

                        o // Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  a  KMS  Key  Alias
                          "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/Exam-
                          pleAlias"

                        If you use a KMS key ID or an alias of your  KMS  key,
                        the  Amazon SageMaker execution role must include per-
                        missions to call kms:Encrypt . If you don't provide  a
                        KMS  key ID, Amazon SageMaker uses the default KMS key
                        for Amazon S3 for your role's  account.  Amazon  Sage-
                        Maker  uses  server-side  encryption  with KMS-managed
                        keys for OutputDataConfig . If you use a bucket policy
                        with  an  s3:PutObject permission that only allows ob-
                        jects with server-side encryption, set  the  condition
                        key  of s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption to "aws:kms" .
                        For more information, see KMS-Managed Encryption  Keys
                        in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.

                        The  KMS  key  policy must grant permission to the IAM
                        role that you specify in your CreateTrainingJob , Cre-
                        ateTransformJob , or CreateHyperParameterTuningJob re-
                        quests. For more information, see Using  Key  Policies
                        in  Amazon Web Services KMS in the Amazon Web Services
                        Key Management Service Developer Guide .

                     S3OutputPath -> (string)
                        Identifies the S3 path where you want Amazon SageMaker
                        to   store   the   model   artifacts.   For   example,
                        s3://bucket-name/key-name-prefix .

                 ResourceConfig -> (structure)
                     Resources, including ML compute instances and ML  storage
                     volumes, that are configured for model training.

                     InstanceType -> (string)
                        The ML compute instance type.

                     InstanceCount -> (integer)
                        The  number  of  ML compute instances to use. For dis-
                        tributed training, provide a value greater than 1.

                     VolumeSizeInGB -> (integer)
                        The size of the ML storage volume  that  you  want  to
                        provision.

                        ML storage volumes store model artifacts and incremen-
                        tal states. Training algorithms might also use the  ML
                        storage volume for scratch space. If you want to store
                        the training data in the  ML  storage  volume,  choose
                        File  as the TrainingInputMode in the algorithm speci-
                        fication.

                        You must specify sufficient ML storage for  your  sce-
                        nario.

                        NOTE:
                            Amazon SageMaker supports only the General Purpose
                            SSD (gp2) ML storage volume type.

                        NOTE:
                            Certain Nitro-based instances include local  stor-
                            age  with a fixed total size, dependent on the in-
                            stance type. When using these instances for train-
                            ing,  Amazon  SageMaker  mounts the local instance
                            storage instead of Amazon  EBS  gp2  storage.  You
                            can't  request  a  VolumeSizeInGB greater than the
                            total size of the local instance storage.

                            For a list of instance types  that  support  local
                            instance storage, including the total size per in-
                            stance type, see Instance Store Volumes .

                     VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
                        The Amazon Web Services KMS key that Amazon  SageMaker
                        uses to encrypt data on the storage volume attached to
                        the ML compute instance(s) that run the training job.

                        NOTE:
                            Certain Nitro-based instances include local  stor-
                            age, dependent on the instance type. Local storage
                            volumes are encrypted using a hardware  module  on
                            the  instance.  You can't request a VolumeKmsKeyId
                            when using an instance type with local storage.

                            For a list of instance types  that  support  local
                            instance storage, see Instance Store Volumes .

                            For  more information about local instance storage
                            encryption, see SSD Instance Store Volumes .

                        The VolumeKmsKeyId can be in any of the following for-
                        mats:

                        o //              KMS              Key              ID
                          "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                        o //  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  a   KMS   Key
                          "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                 VpcConfig -> (structure)
                     A  VpcConfig object that  specifies  the  VPC  that  this
                     training  job  has  access  to. For more information, see
                     Protect Training Jobs by Using an Amazon Virtual  Private
                     Cloud .

                     SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                        The  VPC  security group IDs, in the form sg-xxxxxxxx.
                        Specify the security groups for the VPC that is speci-
                        fied in the Subnets field.

                        (string)

                     Subnets -> (list)
                        The  ID of the subnets in the VPC to which you want to
                        connect your training job or  model.  For  information
                        about the availability of specific instance types, see
                        Supported Instance Types and Availability Zones .

                        (string)

                 StoppingCondition -> (structure)
                     Specifies a limit to how long a model  training  job  can
                     run.  It  also specifies how long a managed Spot training
                     job has to complete. When the job reaches the time limit,
                     Amazon  SageMaker  ends the training job. Use this API to
                     cap model training costs.

                     To stop a job, Amazon SageMaker sends the  algorithm  the
                     SIGTERM signal, which delays job termination for 120 sec-
                     onds. Algorithms can use this 120-second window  to  save
                     the  model  artifacts, so the results of training are not
                     lost.

                     MaxRuntimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                        The maximum length of time, in seconds, that a  train-
                        ing or compilation job can run.

                        For  compilation  jobs,  if  the job does not complete
                        during this time, you will receive a TimeOut error. We
                        recommend  starting  with  900 seconds and increase as
                        necessary based on your model.

                        For all other jobs, if the job does not complete  dur-
                        ing  this  time,  Amazon  SageMaker ends the job. When
                        RetryStrategy is specified in the job request, MaxRun-
                        timeInSeconds  specifies  the  maximum time for all of
                        the attempts in total, not  each  individual  attempt.
                        The  default  value  is 1 day. The maximum value is 28
                        days.

                     MaxWaitTimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                        The maximum length of time, in seconds, that a managed
                        Spot training job has to complete. It is the amount of
                        time spent waiting for Spot capacity plus  the  amount
                        of  time  the  job  can  run.  It  must be equal to or
                        greater than MaxRuntimeInSeconds . If the job does not
                        complete  during  this time, Amazon SageMaker ends the
                        job.

                        When RetryStrategy is specified in  the  job  request,
                        MaxWaitTimeInSeconds  specifies  the  maximum time for
                        all of the attempts in total, not each individual  at-
                        tempt.

                 CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                     A timestamp that indicates when the training job was cre-
                     ated.

                 TrainingStartTime -> (timestamp)
                     Indicates the time when the training job starts on train-
                     ing  instances.  You are billed for the time interval be-
                     tween this time and the value of  TrainingEndTime  .  The
                     start  time  in  CloudWatch Logs might be later than this
                     time. The difference is due to the time it takes to down-
                     load  the  training  data and to the size of the training
                     container.

                 TrainingEndTime -> (timestamp)
                     Indicates the time when the training job ends on training
                     instances.  You  are billed for the time interval between
                     the value of TrainingStartTime and this  time.  For  suc-
                     cessful  jobs  and  stopped  jobs, this is the time after
                     model artifacts are uploaded. For failed  jobs,  this  is
                     the time when Amazon SageMaker detects a job failure.

                 LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                     A  timestamp that indicates when the status of the train-
                     ing job was last modified.

                 SecondaryStatusTransitions -> (list)
                     A history of all  of  the  secondary  statuses  that  the
                     training job has transitioned through.

                     (structure)
                        An  array element of  DescribeTrainingJobResponse$Sec-
                        ondaryStatusTransitions . It provides  additional  de-
                        tails about a status that the training job has transi-
                        tioned through. A training job can be in one  of  sev-
                        eral   states,  for  example,  starting,  downloading,
                        training, or uploading. Within each state, there are a
                        number of intermediate states. For example, within the
                        starting state, Amazon SageMaker could be starting the
                        training  job  or  launching  the  ML instances. These
                        transitional states are referred to as the job's  sec-
                        ondary status.

                        Status -> (string)
                            Contains  a  secondary  status  information from a
                            training job.

                            Status might be one  of  the  following  secondary
                            statuses:
                               InProgress

                            o Starting - Starting the training job.

                            o Downloading  -  An optional stage for algorithms
                              that support File training input mode. It  indi-
                              cates  that  data  is being downloaded to the ML
                              storage volumes.

                            o Training - Training is in progress.

                            o Uploading - Training is complete and  the  model
                              artifacts are being uploaded to the S3 location.

                               Status  messages  are subject to change. There-
                               fore, we recommend not including them  in  code
                               that  programmatically  initiates  actions. For
                               examples,  don't  use  status  messages  in  if
                               statements.

                            To   have  an  overview  of  your  training  job's
                            progress, view TrainingJobStatus and SecondarySta-
                            tus  in   DescribeTrainingJob  , and StatusMessage
                            together. For example, at the start of a  training
                            job, you might see the following:

                            o TrainingJobStatus - InProgress

                            o SecondaryStatus - Training

                 FinalMetricDataList -> (list)
                     A  list  of  final  metric  values  that are set when the
                     training job completes. Used only if the training job was
                     configured to use metrics.

                     (structure)
                        The  name,  value,  and date and time of a metric that
                        was emitted to Amazon CloudWatch.

                        MetricName -> (string)
                            The name of the metric.

                        Value -> (float)
                            The value of the metric.

                        Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                            The date and time that the algorithm  emitted  the
                            metric.

                 EnableNetworkIsolation -> (boolean)
                     If  the  TrainingJob  was created with network isolation,
                     the value is set to true . If network  isolation  is  en-
                     abled,  nodes  can't  communicate beyond the VPC they run
                     in.

                     To encrypt all  communications  between  ML  compute  in-
                     stances in distributed training, choose True . Encryption
                     provides greater security for distributed  training,  but
                     training  might take longer. How long it takes depends on
                     the amount of communication  between  compute  instances,
                     especially  if  you use a deep learning algorithm in dis-
                     tributed training.

                               the training job. This must be an algorithm re-
                               source that you created or subscribe to on Ama-
                               zon  Web Services Marketplace. If you specify a
                               value for this parameter, you can't  specify  a
                               value for TrainingImage .

                            TrainingInputMode -> (string)
                               The training input mode that the algorithm sup-
                               ports. For more information about input  modes,
                               see Algorithms .
                                   Pipe mode

                               If  an  algorithm  supports  Pipe  mode, Amazon
                               SageMaker streams data directly from Amazon  S3
                               to the container.
                                   File mode

                               If  an  algorithm supports File mode, SageMaker
                               downloads the training data from S3 to the pro-
                               visioned  ML storage volume, and mounts the di-
                               rectory to the Docker volume for  the  training
                               container.

                               You  must  provision the ML storage volume with
                               sufficient capacity  to  accommodate  the  data
                               downloaded from S3. In addition to the training
                               data, the ML storage  volume  also  stores  the
                               output  model. The algorithm container uses the
                               ML storage volume to  also  store  intermediate
                               information, if any.

                               For  distributed  algorithms,  training data is
                               distributed uniformly. Your  training  duration
                               is  predictable if the input data objects sizes
                               are approximately the same. SageMaker does  not
                               split the files any further for model training.
                               If the object sizes are skewed, training  won't
                               be  optimal  as  the  data distribution is also
                               skewed when one host in a training  cluster  is
                               overloaded,   thus  becoming  a  bottleneck  in
                               training.
                                   FastFile mode

                               If an algorithm supports FastFile  mode,  Sage-
                               Maker streams data directly from S3 to the con-
                               tainer with no code changes, and provides  file
                               system  access  to  the  data. Users can author
                               their training script to  interact  with  these
                               files as if they were stored on disk.
                                   FastFile  mode  works best when the data is
                                   read sequentially. Augmented manifest files
                                   aren't supported. The startup time is lower
                                   when there are fewer files in the S3 bucket
                                   provided.

                               A  list  of metric definition objects. Each ob-
                               ject specifies the metric name and regular  ex-
                               pressions  used to parse algorithm logs. Amazon
                               SageMaker  publishes  each  metric  to   Amazon

                                   defined metrics.  You  specify  one  metric

                        RoleArn -> (string)
                            The  Amazon  Web Services Identity and Access Man-
                            agement (IAM) role  configured  for  the  training
                            job.

                        InputDataConfig -> (list)
                            An  array  of  Channel objects that describes each
                            data input channel.

                            (structure)
                               A channel is a named input source that training
                               algorithms can consume.

                               ChannelName -> (string)
                                   The name of the channel.

                               DataSource -> (structure)
                                   The location of the channel data.

                                   S3DataSource -> (structure)
                                      The  S3 location of the data source that
                                      is associated with a channel.

                                      S3DataType -> (string)
                                          If you choose S3Prefix , S3Uri iden-
                                          tifies  a  key  name  prefix. Amazon
                                          SageMaker  uses  all  objects   that
                                          match  the specified key name prefix
                                          for model training.

                                          If you choose ManifestFile  ,  S3Uri
                                          identifies an object that is a mani-
                                          fest file containing a list  of  ob-
                                          ject keys that you want Amazon Sage-
                                          Maker to use for model training.

                                          If you choose  AugmentedManifestFile
                                          , S3Uri identifies an object that is
                                          an augmented manifest file  in  JSON
                                          lines format. This file contains the
                                          data  you  want  to  use  for  model
                                          training.  AugmentedManifestFile can
                                          only be used if the Channel's  input
                                          mode is Pipe .

                                      S3Uri -> (string)
                                          Depending on the value specified for
                                          the S3DataType , identifies either a
                                          key  name  prefix or a manifest. For
                                          example:

                                          o A key name prefix might look  like
                                            this:  s3://bucketname/examplepre-
                                            fix

                                          o A manifest might look  like  this:
                                            s3://bucketname/example.manifest
                                            A manifest is an S3  object  which
                                            is  a  JSON  file consisting of an
                                            array of elements. The first  ele-
                                            ment is a prefix which is followed
                                            by one or more suffixes. SageMaker
                                            appends the suffix elements to the
                                            prefix to get a full set of  S3Uri
                                            .  Note  that the prefix must be a
                                            valid non-empty  S3Uri  that  pre-
                                            cludes  users  from  specifying  a
                                            manifest whose individual S3Uri is
                                            sourced from different S3 buckets.
                                            The following code example shows a
                                            valid  manifest format:   [ {"pre-
                                            fix":                   "s3://cus-

                                            "relative/path/custdata-N"       ]
                                            This  JSON  is  equivalent  to the

                                          replicate the entire dataset on each

                                          ByS3Key . If there are n ML  compute
                                          instances  launched  for  a training
                                          job,  each  instance  gets  approxi-
                                          mately  1/n  of the number of S3 ob-
                                          jects. In this case, model  training
                                          on each machine uses only the subset
                                          of training data.

                                          Don't choose  more  ML  compute  in-
                                          stances  for training than available
                                          S3 objects. If you  do,  some  nodes
                                          won't  get any data and you will pay
                                          for nodes that  aren't  getting  any
                                          training  data. This applies in both
                                          File and Pipe modes.  Keep  this  in
                                          mind when developing algorithms.

                                          In  distributed  training, where you
                                          use  multiple  ML  compute  EC2  in-

                                   CompressionType is used only in Pipe  input
                                   mode.  In File mode, leave this field unset
                                   or set it to None.

                               RecordWrapperType -> (string)
                                   Specify RecordIO as the  value  when  input
                                   data  is in raw format but the training al-
                                   gorithm requires the  RecordIO  format.  In
                                   this  case, Amazon SageMaker wraps each in-
                                   dividual S3 object in a RecordIO record. If
                                   the  input data is already in RecordIO for-
                                   mat, you don't need to set this  attribute.

                                   In File mode, leave this field unset or set
                                   it to None.

                               InputMode -> (string)
                                   (Optional)  The  input  mode to use for the
                                   data channel in  a  training  job.  If  you
                                   don't  set  a  value for InputMode , Amazon
                                   SageMaker uses the value set for  Training-
                                   InputMode  . Use this parameter to override
                                   the TrainingInputMode setting in  a   Algo-
                                   rithmSpecification  request when you have a
                                   channel that needs a different  input  mode
                                   from the training job's general setting. To
                                   download the data from Amazon Simple  Stor-
                                   age  Service (Amazon S3) to the provisioned
                                   ML storage volume, and mount the  directory
                                   to a Docker volume, use File input mode. To
                                   stream data directly from Amazon S3 to  the
                                   container, choose Pipe input mode.

                                   To  use  a  model for incremental training,
                                   choose File input model.

                               ShuffleConfig -> (structure)
                                   A configuration for a  shuffle  option  for
                                   input  data in a channel. If you use S3Pre-
                                   fix for S3DataType , this shuffles the  re-
                                   sults  of the S3 key prefix matches. If you
                                   use ManifestFile , the order of the S3  ob-
                                   ject  references  in  the  ManifestFile  is
                                   shuffled. If you use  AugmentedManifestFile
                                   ,  the  order of the JSON lines in the Aug-
                                   mentedManifestFile is shuffled.  The  shuf-
                                   fling  order  is  determined using the Seed
                                   value.

                                   For Pipe input mode, shuffling is  done  at
                                   the   start  of  every  epoch.  With  large
                                   datasets this ensures that the order of the
                                   training  data is different for each epoch,
                                   it helps reduce bias and possible  overfit-
                                   ting.  In  a  multi-node  training job when
                                   ShuffleConfig is combined  with  S3DataDis-
                                   tributionType  of ShardedByS3Key , the data
                                   is shuffled across nodes so that  the  con-
                                   tent sent to a particular node on the first
                                   epoch might be sent to a different node  on
                                   the second epoch.

                        OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
                            The S3 path where model artifacts that you config-
                            ured  when  creating  the  job  are stored. Amazon
                            SageMaker creates subfolders for model artifacts.

                            KmsKeyId -> (string)
                               The Amazon Web Services Key Management  Service
                               (Amazon Web Services KMS) key that Amazon Sage-
                               Maker uses to encrypt the  model  artifacts  at
                               rest  using  Amazon  S3 server-side encryption.
                               The KmsKeyId can be any of the  following  for-
                               mats:

                               o //            KMS            Key           ID
                                 "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                               o // Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  a  KMS  Key
                                 "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                               o // KMS Key Alias  "alias/ExampleAlias"

                               o // Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  a  KMS  Key
                                 Alias

                                 ampleAlias"

                               If you use a KMS key ID or an alias of your KMS
                               key, the Amazon SageMaker execution  role  must
                               include  permissions  to  call kms:Encrypt . If
                               you don't provide a KMS key  ID,  Amazon  Sage-
                               Maker  uses  the  default KMS key for Amazon S3
                               for your role's account. Amazon SageMaker  uses
                               server-side  encryption  with  KMS-managed keys
                               for OutputDataConfig . If you use a bucket pol-
                               icy  with  an s3:PutObject permission that only
                               allows objects with server-side encryption, set
                               the  condition  key of s3:x-amz-server-side-en-
                               cryption to "aws:kms" . For  more  information,

                               The KMS key policy must grant permission to the
                               IAM  role that you specify in your CreateTrain-

                        ResourceConfig -> (structure)
                            Resources, including ML compute instances  and  ML
                            storage  volumes,  that  are  configured for model
                            training.

                            InstanceType -> (string)
                               The ML compute instance type.

                            InstanceCount -> (integer)
                               The number of ML compute instances to use.  For
                               distributed  training,  provide a value greater
                               than 1.

                            VolumeSizeInGB -> (integer)
                               The size of the ML storage volume that you want
                               to provision.

                               ML  storage  volumes  store model artifacts and
                               incremental states. Training  algorithms  might
                               also  use  the  ML  storage  volume for scratch
                               space. If you want to store the  training  data
                               in  the  ML  storage volume, choose File as the
                               TrainingInputMode in the  algorithm  specifica-
                               tion.

                               You must specify sufficient ML storage for your
                               scenario.

                               NOTE:
                                   Amazon SageMaker supports only the  General
                                   Purpose SSD (gp2) ML storage volume type.

                               NOTE:
                                   Certain Nitro-based instances include local
                                   storage with a fixed total size,  dependent
                                   on  the instance type. When using these in-
                                   stances  for  training,  Amazon   SageMaker
                                   mounts  the  local instance storage instead
                                   of Amazon EBS gp2 storage.  You  can't  re-
                                   quest a VolumeSizeInGB greater than the to-
                                   tal size of the local instance storage.

                            VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
                               The  Amazon  Web  Services  KMS key that Amazon
                               SageMaker uses to encrypt data on  the  storage
                               volume  attached  to the ML compute instance(s)
                               that run the training job.

                               NOTE:
                                   Certain Nitro-based instances include local
                                   storage,  dependent  on  the instance type.
                                   Local storage volumes are encrypted using a
                                   hardware  module on the instance. You can't
                                   request a VolumeKmsKeyId when using an  in-
                                   stance type with local storage.

                               (string)

                        StoppingCondition -> (structure)
                            Specifies a limit to how long a model training job
                            can run. It also specifies how long a managed Spot
                            training job has to complete. When the job reaches
                            the time limit, Amazon SageMaker ends the training
                            job. Use this API to cap model training costs.

                            To stop a job, Amazon SageMaker  sends  the  algo-
                            rithm  the SIGTERM signal, which delays job termi-
                            nation for 120 seconds. Algorithms  can  use  this
                            120-second  window to save the model artifacts, so
                            the results of training are not lost.

                            MaxRuntimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                               The maximum length of time, in seconds, that  a
                               training or compilation job can run.

                               For  compilation jobs, if the job does not com-
                               plete during this  time,  you  will  receive  a
                               TimeOut  error.  We recommend starting with 900
                               seconds and increase as necessary based on your
                               model.

                               For  all  other  jobs, if the job does not com-
                               plete during this time, Amazon  SageMaker  ends
                               the job. When RetryStrategy is specified in the
                               job request, MaxRuntimeInSeconds specifies  the
                               maximum  time for all of the attempts in total,
                               not each individual attempt. The default  value
                               is 1 day. The maximum value is 28 days.

                            MaxWaitTimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                               The  maximum length of time, in seconds, that a
                               managed Spot training job has to  complete.  It
                               is  the  amount  of time spent waiting for Spot
                               capacity plus the amount of time  the  job  can
                               run.  It  must  be  equal  to  or  greater than
                               MaxRuntimeInSeconds . If the job does not  com-
                               plete  during  this time, Amazon SageMaker ends
                               the job.

                               When RetryStrategy is specified in the job  re-
                               quest, MaxWaitTimeInSeconds specifies the maxi-
                               mum time for all of the attempts in total,  not
                               each individual attempt.

                        CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                            A  timestamp  that indicates when the training job
                            was created.

                        TrainingStartTime -> (timestamp)
                            Indicates the time when the training job starts on
                            training  instances.  You  are billed for the time
                            interval between this time and the value of Train-
                            ingEndTime  .  The  start  time in CloudWatch Logs
                            might be later than this time. The  difference  is
                            due  to the time it takes to download the training
                            data and to the size of the training container.

                        TrainingEndTime -> (timestamp)
                            Indicates the time when the training job  ends  on
                            training  instances.  You  are billed for the time
                            interval between the  value  of  TrainingStartTime
                            and  this  time.  For  successful jobs and stopped
                            jobs, this is the time after model  artifacts  are
                            uploaded.  For  failed jobs, this is the time when
                            Amazon SageMaker detects a job failure.

                        LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                            A timestamp that indicates when the status of  the
                            training job was last modified.

                        SecondaryStatusTransitions -> (list)
                            A  history  of  all of the secondary statuses that
                            the training job has transitioned through.

                            (structure)
                               An  array  element  of   DescribeTrainingJobRe-
                               sponse$SecondaryStatusTransitions . It provides
                               additional details  about  a  status  that  the
                               training job has transitioned through. A train-
                               ing job can be in one of  several  states,  for
                               example,  starting,  downloading,  training, or
                               uploading. Within each state, there are a  num-
                               ber of intermediate states. For example, within
                               the starting state, Amazon SageMaker  could  be
                               starting  the  training job or launching the ML
                               instances. These transitional  states  are  re-
                               ferred to as the job's secondary status.

                               Status -> (string)
                                   Contains  a  secondary  status  information
                                   from a training job.

                                   Status might be one of the  following  sec-
                                   ondary statuses:
                                      InProgress

                               EndTime -> (timestamp)
                                   A  timestamp  that  shows when the training
                                   job transitioned out of this secondary sta-
                                   tus  state  into  another  secondary status
                                   state or when the training job has ended.

                               StatusMessage -> (string)
                                   A  detailed  description  of  the  progress
                                   within a secondary status.

                        FinalMetricDataList -> (list)
                            A list of final metric values that  are  set  when
                            the  training  job  completes.  Used  only  if the
                            training job was configured to use metrics.

                            (structure)
                               The name, value, and date and time of a  metric
                               that was emitted to Amazon CloudWatch.

                               MetricName -> (string)
                                   The name of the metric.

                               Value -> (float)
                                   The value of the metric.

                               Timestamp -> (timestamp)

                                      Whether  you  use an S3Prefix or a Mani-
                                      festFile  for  the  data  type.  If  you
                                      choose S3Prefix , S3Uri identifies a key
                                      name prefix. Amazon SageMaker  uses  all
                                      objects with the specified key name pre-
                                      fix  for  the  processing  job.  If  you
                                      choose  ManifestFile  , S3Uri identifies
                                      an object that is a manifest  file  con-
                                      taining  a  list of object keys that you
                                      want Amazon SageMaker  to  use  for  the
                                      processing job.

                                      In File mode,  Amazon  SageMaker  copies
                                      the  data from the input source onto the
                                      local ML storage volume before  starting
                                      your  processing  container. This is the
                                      most commonly used input mode.  In  Pipe
                                      mode,  Amazon  SageMaker  streams  input
                                      data from the source  directly  to  your
                                      processing  container  into  named pipes
                                      without using the ML storage volume.

                                      FullyReplicated , or  whether  the  data
                                      from  Amazon  S3  is shared by Amazon S3
                                      key, downloading one shard  of  data  to
                                      each processing instance.

                                      processing  container.  Gzip can only be
                                      used when Pipe mode is specified as  the
                                      S3InputMode . In Pipe mode, Amazon Sage-
                                      Maker streams input data from the source
                                      directly to your container without using
                                      the EBS volume.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The tag key. Tag keys must  be  unique  per
                                   resource.

                               Value -> (string)
                                   The tag value.

                     TransformJob -> (structure)
                        Information about a transform job that's the source of
                        a trial component.

                        TransformJobName -> (string)
                            The name of the transform job.

                        TransformJobArn -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  transform
                            job.

                        TransformJobStatus -> (string)
                            The status of the transform job.

                            Transform job statuses are:

                            o InProgress - The job is in progress.

                            o Completed - The job has completed.

                            o Failed  -  The  transform job has failed. To see
                              the reason for the failure, see the  FailureRea-
                              son field in the response to a DescribeTransfor-
                              mJob call.

                            o Stopping - The transform job is stopping.

                            o Stopped - The transform job has stopped.

                        FailureReason -> (string)
                            If the transform job failed, the reason it failed.

                        ModelName -> (string)
                            The name of the model associated with  the  trans-
                            form job.

                        MaxConcurrentTransforms -> (integer)
                            The  maximum  number of parallel requests that can
                            be sent to each instance in a  transform  job.  If
                            MaxConcurrentTransforms is set to 0 or left unset,
                            SageMaker checks the optional execution-parameters
                            to  determine  the  settings for your chosen algo-
                            rithm. If the execution-parameters endpoint is not
                            enabled,  the default value is 1. For built-in al-
                            gorithms, you don't need to set a value  for  Max-
                            ConcurrentTransforms .

                        ModelClientConfig -> (structure)
                            Configures  the  timeout and maximum number of re-
                            tries for processing a transform job invocation.

                            InvocationsTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                               The timeout value in seconds for an  invocation
                               request.

                            InvocationsMaxRetries -> (integer)
                               The  maximum  number of retries when invocation
                               requests are failing.

                        MaxPayloadInMB -> (integer)
                            The maximum allowed size of the payload, in MB.  A
                            payload  is  the data portion of a record (without
                            metadata). The value  in  MaxPayloadInMB  must  be
                            greater  than,  or  equal to, the size of a single
                            record. To estimate the size of a  record  in  MB,
                            divide  the  size of your dataset by the number of
                            records. To ensure that the records fit within the
                            maximum   payload   size,  we  recommend  using  a
                            slightly larger value. The default value is 6  MB.
                            For  cases  where the payload might be arbitrarily
                            large and is transmitted using HTTP chunked encod-
                            ing,  set  the value to 0. This feature works only
                            in  supported  algorithms.  Currently,   SageMaker
                            built-in  algorithms  do  not support HTTP chunked
                            encoding.

                        BatchStrategy -> (string)
                            Specifies the number of records to  include  in  a
                            mini-batch for an HTTP inference request. A record
                            is a single unit of input data that inference  can
                            be  made  on.  For example, a single line in a CSV
                            file is a record.

                        Environment -> (map)
                            The environment variables to  set  in  the  Docker
                            container.  We support up to 16 key and values en-
                            tries in the map.

                            key -> (string)

                            value -> (string)

                        TransformInput -> (structure)
                            Describes the input source of a transform job  and
                            the way the transform job consumes it.

                            DataSource -> (structure)
                               Describes  the  location  of  the channel data,
                               which is, the S3 location  of  the  input  data
                               that the model can consume.

                               S3DataSource -> (structure)
                                   The  S3 location of the data source that is
                                   associated with a channel.

                                   S3DataType -> (string)
                                      If you choose S3Prefix ,  S3Uri  identi-
                                      fies a key name prefix. Amazon SageMaker
                                      uses all objects with the specified  key
                                      name prefix for batch transform.

                                      If you choose ManifestFile , S3Uri iden-
                                      tifies an object that is a manifest file
                                      containing  a  list  of object keys that
                                      you want Amazon  SageMaker  to  use  for
                                      batch transform.

                                      The  following  values  are  compatible:
                                      ManifestFile , S3Prefix

                                      The following value is  not  compatible:
                                      AugmentedManifestFile

                                   S3Uri -> (string)
                                      Depending on the value specified for the
                                      S3DataType ,  identifies  either  a  key
                                      name prefix or a manifest. For example:

                                      o A  key  name  prefix  might  look like
                                        this: s3://bucketname/exampleprefix .

                                      o A  manifest  might  look  like   this:
                                        s3://bucketname/example.manifest   The
                                        manifest is an S3 object  which  is  a
                                        JSON  file  with the following format:
                                        [        {"prefix":         "s3://cus-

                                        tive/path/custdata-N    The   complete
                                        set of S3Uris in this manifest consti-
                                        tutes the input data for  the  channel
                                        for  this  datasource. The object that
                                        each S3Uris points to must be readable
                                        by  the IAM role that Amazon SageMaker
                                        uses to perform tasks on your behalf.

                            ContentType -> (string)
                               The multipurpose internet mail extension (MIME)
                               type  of  the  data.  Amazon SageMaker uses the
                               MIME type with each http call to transfer  data
                               to the transform job.

                            CompressionType -> (string)
                               If  your  transform data is compressed, specify
                               the compression type. Amazon SageMaker automat-
                               ically  decompresses the data for the transform
                               job accordingly. The default value is None .

                            SplitType -> (string)
                               The method to use to split the transform  job's
                               data  files  into smaller batches. Splitting is
                               necessary when the total size of each object is
                               too  large  to fit in a single request. You can
                               also use data splitting to improve  performance
                               by processing multiple concurrent mini-batches.
                               The default value for SplitType is None , which
                               indicates  that input data files are not split,
                               and request payloads contain  the  entire  con-
                               tents of an input object. Set the value of this
                               parameter to Line to split records on a newline
                               character  boundary.  SplitType also supports a
                               number of record-oriented binary data  formats.
                               Currently, the supported record formats are:

                               o RecordIO

                               o TFRecord

                               When  splitting  is  enabled,  the  size  of  a
                               mini-batch depends on the values of the  Batch-
                               Strategy  and  MaxPayloadInMB  parameters. When
                               the value of  BatchStrategy  is  MultiRecord  ,
                               Amazon  SageMaker  sends  the maximum number of
                               records in each request, up to the  MaxPayload-
                               InMB  limit.  If  the value of BatchStrategy is
                               SingleRecord , Amazon SageMaker sends  individ-
                               ual records in each request.

                               NOTE:
                                   Some  data  formats represent a record as a
                                   binary payload wrapped with  extra  padding
                                   bytes.  When  splitting is applied to a bi-
                                   nary data format, padding is removed if the
                                   value  of BatchStrategy is set to SingleRe-
                                   cord . Padding is not removed if the  value
                                   of BatchStrategy is set to MultiRecord .

                        TransformOutput -> (structure)
                            Describes the results of a transform job.

                            S3OutputPath -> (string)
                               The  Amazon S3 path where you want Amazon Sage-
                               Maker to store the  results  of  the  transform
                               job.                For                example,
                               s3://bucket-name/key-name-prefix .

                               For every S3  object  used  as  input  for  the
                               transform   job,  batch  transform  stores  the
                               transformed data with an .``out`` suffix  in  a
                               corresponding  subfolder in the location in the
                               output prefix. For example, for the input  data
                               stored    at   s3://bucket-name/input-name-pre-
                               fix/dataset01/data.csv , batch transform stores
                               the  transformed  data at s3://bucket-name/out-
                               put-name-prefix/input-name-prefix/data.csv.out
                               . Batch transform doesn't upload partially pro-
                               cessed objects. For an  input  S3  object  that
                               contains   multiple   records,  it  creates  an
                               .``out`` file only if the  transform  job  suc-
                               ceeds  on  the entire file. When the input con-
                               tains multiple S3 objects, the batch  transform
                               job processes the listed S3 objects and uploads
                               only the output for successfully processed  ob-
                               jects. If any object fails in the transform job
                               batch transform marks  the  job  as  failed  to
                               prompt investigation.

                            Accept -> (string)
                               The  MIME type used to specify the output data.
                               Amazon SageMaker uses the MIME type  with  each
                               http  call  to transfer data from the transform
                               job.

                            AssembleWith -> (string)
                               Defines how to  assemble  the  results  of  the
                               transform  job  as a single S3 object. Choose a
                               format that is most convenient to you. To  con-
                               catenate  the results in binary format, specify
                               None . To add a newline character at the end of
                               every transformed record, specify Line .

                            KmsKeyId -> (string)
                               The  Amazon Web Services Key Management Service
                               (Amazon Web Services KMS) key that Amazon Sage-
                               Maker  uses  to  encrypt the model artifacts at
                               rest using Amazon  S3  server-side  encryption.
                               The  KmsKeyId  can be any of the following for-
                               mats:

                               o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

                               o Key                                      ARN:

                                 ampleAlias

                               If you don't provide a KMS key ID, Amazon Sage-
                               Maker  uses  the  default KMS key for Amazon S3
                               for your role's account. For more  information,

                               The KMS key policy must grant permission to the
                               IAM  role that you specify in your  CreateModel
                               request. For more information,  see  Using  Key

                        TransformResources -> (structure)
                            Describes  the  resources,  including  ML instance
                            types and ML instance count, to use for  transform
                            job.

                            InstanceType -> (string)
                               The  ML compute instance type for the transform
                               job. If you are using  built-in  algorithms  to
                               transform  moderately sized datasets, we recom-
                               mend using ml.m4.xlarge or ml.m5.large instance
                               types.

                            InstanceCount -> (integer)
                               The  number  of  ML compute instances to use in
                               the transform job.  For  distributed  transform
                               jobs,  specify  a value greater than 1. The de-
                               fault value is 1 .

                            VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
                               The Amazon Web Services Key Management  Service
                               (Amazon Web Services KMS) key that Amazon Sage-
                               Maker uses to encrypt model data on the storage
                               volume  attached  to the ML compute instance(s)
                               that run the batch transform job.

                               NOTE:
                                   Certain Nitro-based instances include local
                                   storage,  dependent  on  the instance type.
                                   Local storage volumes are encrypted using a
                                   hardware  module on the instance. You can't
                                   request a VolumeKmsKeyId when using an  in-
                                   stance type with local storage.

                                   For  a  list of instance types that support
                                   local instance storage, see Instance  Store
                                   Volumes .

                               The  VolumeKmsKeyId can be any of the following
                               formats:

                               o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

                               o Key                                      ARN:

                                 ampleAlias

                        CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                            A timestamp that shows when the transform Job  was
                            created.

                        TransformStartTime -> (timestamp)
                            Indicates  when the transform job starts on ML in-
                            stances. You are billed for the time interval  be-
                            tween  this time and the value of TransformEndTime
                            .

                        TransformEndTime -> (timestamp)
                            Indicates when the transform  job  has  been  com-
                            pleted,  or  has stopped or failed. You are billed
                            for the time interval between this  time  and  the
                            value of TransformStartTime .

                        LabelingJobArn -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the labeling job
                            that created the transform job.

                        AutoMLJobArn -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  AutoML  job
                            that created the transform job.

                        DataProcessing -> (structure)
                            The  data structure used to specify the data to be
                            used for inference in a batch transform job and to
                            associate the data that is relevant to the predic-
                            tion results in the output. The input filter  pro-
                            vided allows you to exclude input data that is not
                            needed for inference in a batch transform job. The
                            output filter provided allows you to include input
                            data relevant to interpreting the  predictions  in
                            the output from the job. For more information, see
                            Associate Prediction  Results  with  their  Corre-
                            sponding Input Records .

                            InputFilter -> (string)
                               A  JSONPath expression used to select a portion
                               of the input data to pass to the algorithm. Use
                               the  InputFilter  parameter  to exclude fields,
                               such as an ID column, from the  input.  If  you
                               want  Amazon SageMaker to pass the entire input
                               dataset to the algorithm,  accept  the  default
                               value $ .

                               Examples: "$" , "$[1:]" , "$.features"

                            OutputFilter -> (string)
                               A  JSONPath expression used to select a portion
                               of the joined dataset to  save  in  the  output
                               file  for  a  batch  transform job. If you want
                               Amazon SageMaker  to  store  the  entire  input
                               dataset  in  the output file, leave the default
                               value, $ . If you specify indexes  that  aren't
                               within   the   dimension  size  of  the  joined
                               dataset, you get an error.

                               Examples: "$" , "$[0,5:]" , "$['id','SageMaker-
                               Output']"

                            JoinSource -> (string)
                               Specifies  the  source of the data to join with
                               the transformed data. The valid values are None
                               and  Input  . The default value is None , which
                               specifies not to join the input with the trans-
                               formed  data.  If  you want the batch transform
                               job to join the original input  data  with  the
                               transformed data, set JoinSource to Input . You
                               can specify OutputFilter as an additional  fil-
                               ter  to  select a portion of the joined dataset
                               and store it in the output file.

                               For JSON or JSONLines objects, such as  a  JSON
                               array,  SageMaker  adds the transformed data to
                               the input JSON object in  an  attribute  called
                               SageMakerOutput  .  The  joined result for JSON
                               must be a key-value pair object. If  the  input
                               is  not a key-value pair object, SageMaker cre-
                               ates a new JSON file. In the new JSON file, and
                               the input data is stored under the SageMakerIn-
                               put key and the results  are  stored  in  Sage-
                               MakerOutput .

                               For  CSV  data,  SageMaker  takes each row as a
                               JSON array and joins the transformed data  with
                               the  input by appending each transformed row to
                               the end of the input. The joined data  has  the
                               original input data followed by the transformed
                               data and the output is a CSV file.

                                   Currently  the  only supported cron expres-
                                   sions are:

                                   o If you want to set the job to start every
                                     hour,  please use the following:  Hourly:
                                     cron(0 * ? * * *)

                                   o If you  want  to  start  the  job  daily:
                                     cron(0 [00-23] ? * * *)

                                   For  example,  the following are valid cron
                                   expressions:

                                   o Daily at noon UTC: cron(0 12 ? * * *)

                                   o Daily at midnight UTC: cron(0 0 ? * * *)

                                   To support running every 6, 12  hours,  the
                                   following are also supported:
                                      cron(0 [00-23]/[01-24] ? * * *)

                                   For  example,  the following are valid cron
                                   expressions:

                                   o Every 12  hours,  starting  at  5pm  UTC:
                                     cron(0 17/12 ? * * *)

                                   o Every  two  hours  starting  at midnight:
                                     cron(0 0/2 ? * * *)

                                   NOTE:

                                      o Even though the cron expression is set
                                        to  start  at 5PM UTC, note that there
                                        could be a delay of 0-20 minutes  from
                                        the  actual  requested time to run the
                                        execution.

                                      o We recommend that if you would like  a
                                        daily  schedule,  you  do  not provide
                                        this parameter. Amazon SageMaker  will
                                        pick a time for running every day.

                                               Amazon SageMaker uses  to  per-
                                               form tasks on your behalf.

                                   ContentType -> (string)
                                      The multipurpose internet mail extension
                                      (MIME) type of the  data.  Amazon  Sage-
                                      Maker  uses the MIME type with each http
                                      call to transfer data to  the  transform
                                      job.

                                   CompressionType -> (string)
                                      If  your  transform  data is compressed,
                                      specify  the  compression  type.  Amazon
                                      SageMaker automatically decompresses the
                                      data for the transform job  accordingly.
                                      The default value is None .

                                   SplitType -> (string)
                                      The method to use to split the transform
                                      job's data files into  smaller  batches.
                                      Splitting  is  necessary  when the total
                                      size of each object is too large to  fit
                                      in  a  single  request. You can also use
                                      data splitting to improve performance by
                                      processing      multiple      concurrent
                                      mini-batches.  The  default  value   for
                                      SplitType is None , which indicates that
                                      input data files are not split, and  re-
                                      quest  payloads  contain the entire con-
                                      tents of an input object. Set the  value
                                      of  this  parameter  to  Line  to  split
                                      records on a newline character boundary.
                                      SplitType  also  supports  a  number  of
                                      record-oriented  binary  data   formats.
                                      Currently,  the supported record formats
                                      are:

                                      o RecordIO

                                      o TFRecord

                                      When splitting is enabled, the size of a
                                      mini-batch  depends on the values of the
                                      BatchStrategy and MaxPayloadInMB parame-
                                      ters. When the value of BatchStrategy is
                                      MultiRecord , Amazon SageMaker sends the
                                      maximum  number  of  records in each re-
                                      quest, up to the  MaxPayloadInMB  limit.
                                      If  the  value  of BatchStrategy is Sin-
                                      gleRecord , Amazon SageMaker sends indi-
                                      vidual records in each request.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Some data formats represent a record
                                          as a binary payload wrapped with ex-
                                          tra padding bytes. When splitting is
                                          applied to  a  binary  data  format,
                                          padding  is  removed if the value of
                                          BatchStrategy is set to SingleRecord
                                          .  Padding  is  not  removed  if the
                                          value of  BatchStrategy  is  set  to
                                          MultiRecord .

                               TransformOutput -> (structure)
                                   Identifies the Amazon S3 location where you
                                   want  Amazon  SageMaker to save the results
                                   from the transform job.

                                   S3OutputPath -> (string)
                                      The Amazon S3 path where you want Amazon
                                      SageMaker  to  store  the results of the
                                      transform     job.     For      example,
                                      s3://bucket-name/key-name-prefix .

                                      For  every  S3  object used as input for
                                      the  transform  job,   batch   transform
                                      stores  the  transformed  data  with  an
                                      .``out`` suffix in a corresponding  sub-
                                      folder  in  the  location  in the output
                                      prefix. For example, for the input  data
                                      stored      at      s3://bucket-name/in-
                                      put-name-prefix/dataset01/data.csv     ,
                                      batch  transform  stores the transformed
                                      data      at       s3://bucket-name/out-
                                      put-name-prefix/input-name-pre-
                                      fix/data.csv.out   .   Batch   transform
                                      doesn't  upload  partially processed ob-
                                      jects. For an input S3 object that  con-
                                      tains  multiple  records,  it creates an
                                      .``out`` file only if the transform  job
                                      succeeds  on  the  entire file. When the
                                      input contains multiple S3 objects,  the
                                      batch transform job processes the listed
                                      S3 objects and uploads only  the  output
                                      for  successfully  processed objects. If
                                      any object fails in  the  transform  job
                                      batch  transform marks the job as failed
                                      to prompt investigation.

                                   Accept -> (string)
                                      The MIME type used to specify the output
                                      data.  Amazon  SageMaker  uses  the MIME
                                      type with each  http  call  to  transfer
                                      data from the transform job.

                                   AssembleWith -> (string)

                                      the transform job as a single S3 object.
                                      Choose  a format that is most convenient
                                      to you. To concatenate  the  results  in
                                      binary  format,  specify None . To add a
                                      newline character at the  end  of  every
                                      transformed record, specify Line .

                                          the  instance  type.  Local  storage
                                          volumes  are encrypted using a hard-
                                          ware module  on  the  instance.  You
                                          can't  request a VolumeKmsKeyId when
                                          using an instance  type  with  local
                                          storage.
