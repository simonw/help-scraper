LIST-TRIAL-COMPONENTS()                                LIST-TRIAL-COMPONENTS()



NAME
       list-trial-components -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  trial  components in your account. You can sort the list by
       trial component name or creation time. You can filter the list to  show
       only  components  that  were  created in a specific time range. You can
       also filter on one of the following:

       o ExperimentName

       o SourceArn

       o TrialName

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-trial-components is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: TrialComponentSummaries

OPTIONS
       --experiment-name (string)
          A filter that returns only components that are part of the specified
          experiment. If you specify ExperimentName  ,  you  can't  filter  by
          SourceArn or TrialName .

       --trial-name (string)
          A filter that returns only components that are part of the specified
          trial. If you specify TrialName , you can't filter by ExperimentName
          or SourceArn .

       --source-arn (string)
          A filter that returns only components that have the specified source
          Amazon Resource Name (ARN). If you specify  SourceArn  ,  you  can't
          filter by ExperimentName or TrialName .

       --created-after (timestamp)
          A  filter  that  returns only components created after the specified
          time.

       --created-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only components created before  the  specified
          time.

       --sort-by (string)
          The property used to sort results. The default value is CreationTime
          .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order. The default value is Descending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
