NAME
       list-inference-recommendations-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists recommendation jobs that satisfy various filters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-inference-recommendations-jobs  is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: InferenceRecommendationsJobs

OPTIONS
       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only jobs created  after  the  specified  time
          (timestamp).

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A  filter  that  returns only jobs created before the specified time
          (timestamp).

       --last-modified-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only jobs that were last  modified  after  the
          specified time (timestamp).

       --last-modified-time-before (timestamp)
          A  filter  that returns only jobs that were last modified before the
          specified time (timestamp).

       --name-contains (string)
          A string in the job name. This filter returns  only  recommendations
          whose name contains the specified string.

       --status-equals (string)
          A  filter  that retrieves only inference recommendations jobs with a
          specific status.

          Possible values:

          o PENDING

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o COMPLETED

          o FAILED

          o STOPPING

          o STOPPED

       --sort-by (string)
          The parameter by which to sort the results.

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

          o Status

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for the results.

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
