UPDATE-WORKFORCE()                                          UPDATE-WORKFORCE()



NAME
       update-workforce -

DESCRIPTION
       Use this operation to update your workforce. You can use this operation
       to require that workers use specific IP addresses to work on tasks  and
       to  update your OpenID Connect (OIDC) Identity Provider (IdP) workforce
       configuration.

       Use SourceIpConfig to restrict worker access to  tasks  to  a  specific
       range  of  IP addresses. You specify allowed IP addresses by creating a
       list of up to ten CIDRs . By default, a workforce isn't  restricted  to
       specific  IP addresses. If you specify a range of IP addresses, workers
       who attempt to access tasks using any IP address outside the  specified
       range  are  denied and get a Not Found error message on the worker por-
       tal.

       Use OidcConfig to update the configuration of a workforce created using
       your own OIDC IdP.

       WARNING:
          You  can  only  update your OIDC IdP configuration when there are no
          work teams associated with your workforce. You can delete work teams
          using the operation.

       After  restricting  access  to a range of IP addresses or updating your
       OIDC IdP configuration with this operation, you can view details  about
       your update workforce using the operation.

       WARNING:
          This operation only applies to private workforces.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          figuration for a workforce made using your own IdP.

          ClientId -> (string)
              The OIDC IdP client ID used to configure your private workforce.

          ClientSecret -> (string)
              The OIDC IdP client secret used to configure your private  work-
              force.

          Issuer -> (string)
              The OIDC IdP issuer used to configure your private workforce.

          AuthorizationEndpoint -> (string)

              vate workforce.

          TokenEndpoint -> (string)
              The OIDC IdP token endpoint used to configure your private work-
              force.

          UserInfoEndpoint -> (string)

              private workforce.

              The OIDC IdP logout endpoint  used  to  configure  your  private
              workforce.

          JwksUri -> (string)
              The  OIDC IdP JSON Web Key Set (Jwks) URI used to configure your
              private workforce.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ClientId=string,ClientSecret=string,Issuer=string,AuthorizationEndpoint=string,TokenEndpoint=string,UserInfoEndpoint=string,LogoutEndpoint=string,JwksUri=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ClientId": "string",
            "ClientSecret": "string",
            "Issuer": "string",
            "AuthorizationEndpoint": "string",

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
