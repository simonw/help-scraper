LIST-ASSOCIATIONS()                                        LIST-ASSOCIATIONS()



NAME
       list-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the associations in your account and their properties.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-associations  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: AssociationSummaries

OPTIONS
       --source-arn (string)
          A filter that returns only associations with  the  specified  source
          ARN.

       --destination-arn (string)
          A  filter that returns only associations with the specified destina-
          tion Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

       --source-type (string)
          A filter that returns only associations with  the  specified  source
          type.

       --destination-type (string)
          A  filter that returns only associations with the specified destina-
          tion type.

       --association-type (string)
          A filter that returns only associations of the specified type.

          Possible values:

          o ContributedTo

          o AssociatedWith

          o DerivedFrom

          o Produced

       --created-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only associations  created  on  or  after  the
          specified time.

       --created-before (timestamp)
          A  filter  that  returns  only associations created on or before the
          specified time.

       --sort-by (string)
          The property used to sort results. The default value is CreationTime
          .

          Possible values:

          o SourceArn

          o DestinationArn

          o SourceType

          o DestinationType

          o CreationTime

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order. The default value is Descending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              tion is an entity that links other lineage or  experiment  enti-
              ties.  An example would be an association between a training job
              and a model.

              SourceArn -> (string)

              DestinationArn -> (string)

                 The source type.

                 The destination type.

              AssociationType -> (string)
                 The type of the association.

              SourceName -> (string)
                 The name of the source.

              DestinationName -> (string)
                 The name of the destination.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the association was created.

              CreatedBy -> (structure)
                 Information about the user who created or modified an experi-
                 ment, trial, trial component, lineage group, or project.

                 UserProfileArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the user's profile.

                 UserProfileName -> (string)
                     The name of the user's profile.

                 DomainId -> (string)
                     The domain associated with the user.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token for getting the next set of associations, if there are any.
