LIST-ENDPOINTS()                                              LIST-ENDPOINTS()



NAME
       list-endpoints -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists endpoints.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-endpoints  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Endpoints

OPTIONS
       --sort-by (string)
          Sorts the list of results. The default is CreationTime .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

          o Status

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for results. The default is Descending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --name-contains (string)
          A string in endpoint names. This filter returns only endpoints whose
          name contains the specified string.

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A  filter  that  returns only endpoints that were created before the
          specified time (timestamp).

       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only endpoints with a  creation  time  greater
          than or equal to the specified time (timestamp).

       --last-modified-time-before (timestamp)
          A  filter  that returns only endpoints that were modified before the
          specified timestamp.

       --last-modified-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only endpoints that were  modified  after  the
          specified timestamp.

       --status-equals (string)
          A filter that returns only endpoints with the specified status.

          Possible values:

          o OutOfService

          o Creating

          o Updating

          o SystemUpdating

          o RollingBack

          o InService

          o Deleting

          o Failed

          o UpdateRollbackFailed

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Endpoints -> (list)
          An array or endpoint objects.

          (structure)
              Provides summary information for an endpoint.

              EndpointName -> (string)
                 The name of the endpoint.

              EndpointArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp that shows when the endpoint was created.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp that shows when the endpoint was last modified.

              EndpointStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the endpoint.

                 o OutOfService  :  Endpoint is not available to take incoming
                   requests.

                 o Creating : CreateEndpoint is executing.

                 o Updating           :           UpdateEndpoint            or
                   UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities is executing.

                 o SystemUpdating  :  Endpoint  is  undergoing maintenance and
                   cannot be updated or deleted or re-scaled until it has com-
                   pleted. This maintenance operation does not change any cus-
                   tomer-specified values such as VPC config, KMS  encryption,
                   model, instance type, or instance count.

                 o RollingBack  : Endpoint fails to scale up or down or change
                   its variant weight and is in the process of rolling back to
                   its  previous  configuration.  Once the rollback completes,
                   endpoint returns to an InService status. This  transitional
                   status only applies to an endpoint that has autoscaling en-
                   abled and is undergoing variant weight or capacity  changes
                   as  part  of  an UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities call or
                   when the  UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities  operation  is
                   called explicitly.

                 o InService  :  Endpoint is available to process incoming re-
                   quests.

                 o Deleting : DeleteEndpoint is executing.

                 o Failed  :  Endpoint  could  not  be  created,  updated,  or
                   re-scaled. Use DescribeEndpointOutput$FailureReason for in-
                   formation about the failure. DeleteEndpoint is the only op-
                   eration that can be performed on a failed endpoint.

                 To  get  a list of endpoints with a specified status, use the
                 StatusEquals filter with a call to ListEndpoints .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, SageMaker returns this token.  To  re-
          trieve  the  next set of training jobs, use it in the subsequent re-
          quest.
