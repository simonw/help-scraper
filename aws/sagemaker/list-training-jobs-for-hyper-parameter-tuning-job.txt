NAME
       list-training-jobs-for-hyper-parameter-tuning-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  list of  TrainingJobSummary objects that describe the training
       jobs that a hyperparameter tuning job launched.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-training-jobs-for-hyper-parameter-tuning-job is a paginated opera-
       tion.  Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire
       data set of results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by  providing  the
       --no-paginate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argu-
       ment on a paginated response, the --query argument  must  extract  data
       from  the  results  of the following query expressions: TrainingJobSum-
       maries

SYNOPSIS
            list-training-jobs-for-hyper-parameter-tuning-job
          --hyper-parameter-tuning-job-name <value>
          [--status-equals <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --hyper-parameter-tuning-job-name (string)
          The name of the tuning job whose training jobs you want to list.

       --status-equals (string)
          A filter that returns only training jobs with the specified status.

          Possible values:

          o InProgress

          o Completed

          o Failed

          o Stopping

          o Stopped

       --sort-by (string)
          The field to sort results by. The default is Name .

          If the value of this field is FinalObjectiveMetricValue , any train-
          ing jobs that did not return an objective metric are not listed.

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

          o Status

          o FinalObjectiveMetricValue

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for results. The default is Ascending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TrainingJobSummaries -> (list)
          A  list  of   TrainingJobSummary  objects that describe the training
          jobs that the ListTrainingJobsForHyperParameterTuningJob request re-
          turned.

          (structure)
              The container for the summary information about a training job.

              TrainingJobDefinitionName -> (string)
                 The training job definition name.

              TrainingJobName -> (string)
                 The name of the training job.

              TrainingJobArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the training job.

              TuningJobName -> (string)
                 The HyperParameter tuning job that launched the training job.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the training job was created.

              TrainingStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the training job started.

              TrainingEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 Specifies the time when the training job ends on training in-
                 stances. You are billed for the  time  interval  between  the
                 value of TrainingStartTime and this time. For successful jobs
                 and stopped jobs, this is the time after model artifacts  are
                 uploaded.  For  failed  jobs, this is the time when SageMaker
                 detects a job failure.

              TrainingJobStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the training job.

              TunedHyperParameters -> (map)
                 A list of the hyperparameters for which you specified  ranges
                 to search.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              FailureReason -> (string)
                 The reason that the training job failed.

              FinalHyperParameterTuningJobObjectiveMetric -> (structure)
                 The   FinalHyperParameterTuningJobObjectiveMetric object that
                 specifies the value of the objective metric of the tuning job
                 that launched this training job.

                 Type -> (string)
                     Whether  to  minimize  or  maximize the objective metric.
                     Valid values are Minimize and Maximize.

                 MetricName -> (string)
                     The name of the objective metric.

                 Value -> (float)
                     The value of the objective metric.

              ObjectiveStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the objective metric for the training job:

                 o Succeeded: The final objective metric for the training  job
                   was  evaluated by the hyperparameter tuning job and used in
                   the hyperparameter tuning process.

                 o Pending: The training job is in progress and evaluation  of
                   its final objective metric is pending.

                 o Failed: The final objective metric for the training job was
                   not evaluated, and was not used in the hyperparameter  tun-
                   ing  process.  This  typically occurs when the training job
                   failed or did not emit an objective metric.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the result of this ListTrainingJobsForHyperParameterTuningJob re-
          quest was truncated, the response includes a NextToken . To retrieve
          the next set of training jobs, use the token in the next request.
