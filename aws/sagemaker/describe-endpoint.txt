NAME
       describe-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the description of an endpoint.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-endpoint
          --endpoint-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --endpoint-name (string)
          The name of the endpoint.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          Name of the endpoint.

       EndpointArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint.

       EndpointStatus -> (string)
          The status of the endpoint.

          o OutOfService : Endpoint is not  available  to  take  incoming  re-
            quests.

          o Creating :  CreateEndpoint is executing.

          o Updating  :  UpdateEndpoint or  UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities
            is executing.

          o SystemUpdating : Endpoint is undergoing maintenance and cannot  be
            updated or deleted or re-scaled until it has completed. This main-
            tenance operation does not change  any  customer-specified  values
            such  as  VPC config, KMS encryption, model, instance type, or in-
            stance count.

          o RollingBack : Endpoint fails to scale up or  down  or  change  its
            variant weight and is in the process of rolling back to its previ-
            ous configuration. Once the rollback completes,  endpoint  returns
            to  an  InService status. This transitional status only applies to
            an endpoint that has autoscaling enabled and is undergoing variant
            weight  or  capacity  changes as part of an  UpdateEndpointWeight-
            sAndCapacities call or when  the   UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapaci-
            ties operation is called explicitly.

          o InService : Endpoint is available to process incoming requests.

          o Deleting :  DeleteEndpoint is executing.

          o Failed : Endpoint could not be created, updated, or re-scaled. Use
            DescribeEndpointOutput$FailureReason  for  information  about  the
            failure.   DeleteEndpoint  is  the only operation that can be per-
            formed on a failed endpoint.

       FailureReason -> (string)
          If the status of the endpoint is Failed , the reason why it failed.

          A timestamp that shows when the endpoint was created.

       LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
          A timestamp that shows when the endpoint was last modified.

       LastDeploymentConfig -> (structure)
          The most recent deployment configuration for the endpoint.

          BlueGreenUpdatePolicy -> (structure)
              Update policy for a blue/green deployment. If this update policy
              is  specified,  SageMaker creates a new fleet during the deploy-
              ment while maintaining the old fleet. SageMaker flips traffic to
              the new fleet according to the specified traffic routing config-
              uration. Only one update policy should be used in the deployment
              configuration.  If no update policy is specified, SageMaker uses
              a blue/green deployment strategy with all at once traffic shift-
              ing by default.

              TrafficRoutingConfiguration -> (structure)

                 the old fleet to the new fleet during an endpoint deployment.

                     Traffic routing strategy type.

                       in a single step.

                     o CANARY  :  Endpoint  traffic shifts to the new fleet in
                       two steps. The first step is the  canary,  which  is  a
                       small  portion  of  the traffic. The second step is the
                       remainder of the traffic.

                     o LINEAR : Endpoint traffic shifts to the new fleet in  n
                       steps of a configurable size.

                     The  waiting  time (in seconds) between incremental steps
                     to turn on traffic on the new endpoint fleet.

                          number of instances.

                        o CAPACITY_PERCENT  :  The endpoint activates based on
                          the specified percentage of capacity.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        Defines the capacity size, either as a number  of  in-

                          number of instances.

                        o CAPACITY_PERCENT : The endpoint activates  based  on
                          the specified percentage of capacity.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        Defines  the  capacity size, either as a number of in-
                        stances or a capacity percentage.

              TerminationWaitInSeconds -> (integer)
                 Additional waiting time in seconds after the completion of an
                 endpoint  deployment  before  terminating  the  old  endpoint
                 fleet. Default is 0.

              MaximumExecutionTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                 Maximum execution timeout for the deployment. Note  that  the
                 timeout  value  should  be larger than the total waiting time

                 List of CloudWatch alarms in your account that are configured
                 to  monitor metrics on an endpoint. If any alarms are tripped
                 during a deployment, SageMaker rolls back the deployment.

                 (structure)
