LIST-ACTIONS()                                                  LIST-ACTIONS()



NAME
       list-actions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the actions in your account and their properties.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-actions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: ActionSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-actions
          [--source-uri <value>]
          [--action-type <value>]
          [--created-after <value>]
          [--created-before <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-uri (string)
          A filter that returns only actions with the specified source URI.

       --action-type (string)
          A filter that returns only actions of the specified type.

       --created-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only actions created on or after the specified
          time.

       --created-before (timestamp)
          A  filter  that returns only actions created on or before the speci-
          fied time.

       --sort-by (string)
          The property used to sort results. The default value is CreationTime
          .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order. The default value is Descending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ActionSummaries -> (list)
          A list of actions and their properties.

          (structure)
              Lists the properties of an action . An action represents an  ac-
              tion  or activity. Some examples are a workflow step and a model
              deployment. Generally, an action involves at least one input ar-
              tifact or output artifact.

              ActionArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the action.

                 The name of the action.

              Source -> (structure)
                 The source of the action.

                 SourceUri -> (string)
                     The URI of the source.

                 SourceType -> (string)
                     The type of the source.

                 SourceId -> (string)
                     The ID of the source.

              ActionType -> (string)
                 The type of the action.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the action.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the action was created.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the action was last modified.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token for getting the next set of actions, if there are any.
