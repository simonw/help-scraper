          Defines the type of supervised learning  available  for  the  candi-
          dates.  For more information, see Amazon SageMaker Autopilot problem
          types and algorithm support .

          Possible values:

          o BinaryClassification

          o MulticlassClassification

          o Regression

       --auto-ml-job-objective (structure)
          Defines the objective metric used to measure the predictive  quality
          of  an AutoML job. You provide an  AutoMLJobObjective$MetricName and
          Autopilot infers whether to minimize or maximize it.

          MetricName -> (string)
              The name of the objective metric used to measure the  predictive
              quality  of  a machine learning system. This metric is optimized
              during training to provide the best estimate for model parameter
              values from data.

              Here are the options:

              o MSE  :  The  mean  squared  error  (MSE) is the average of the
                squared differences between the predicted and  actual  values.
                It is used for regression. MSE values are always positive: the
                better a model is at predicting the actual values, the smaller
                the  MSE  value is. When the data contains outliers, they tend
                to dominate the MSE, which might cause subpar prediction  per-
                formance.

              o Accuracy  :  The  ratio  of the number of correctly classified
                items to the total number of (correctly and incorrectly) clas-
                sified items. It is used for binary and multiclass classifica-
                tion. It measures how close the predicted class values are  to
                the  actual values. Accuracy values vary between zero and one:
                one indicates perfect accuracy and zero indicates perfect  in-
                accuracy.

              o F1  :  The  F1 score is the harmonic mean of the precision and
                recall. It is used for binary classification into classes tra-
                ditionally  referred  to as positive and negative. Predictions
                are said to be true when they  match  their  actual  (correct)
                class  and  false  when they do not. Precision is the ratio of
                the true positive predictions to all positive predictions (in-
                cluding  the  false  positives) in a data set and measures the
                quality of the prediction when it predicts the positive class.
                Recall (or sensitivity) is the ratio of the true positive pre-
                dictions to all actual positive  instances  and  measures  how
                completely a model predicts the actual class members in a data
                set.  The  standard  F1  score  weighs  precision  and  recall
                equally.  But  which  metric is paramount typically depends on
                specific aspects of a problem. F1 scores vary between zero and
                one:  one indicates the best possible performance and zero the
                worst.

              o AUC : The area under the curve (AUC) metric is used to compare
                and  evaluate  binary classification by algorithms such as lo-
                gistic regression that return probabilities.  A  threshold  is
                needed to map the probabilities into classifications. The rel-
                evant curve is the  receiver  operating  characteristic  curve
                that plots the true positive rate (TPR) of predictions (or re-
                call) against the false positive rate (FPR) as a  function  of
                the  threshold  value,  above which a prediction is considered
                positive. Increasing the threshold results in fewer false pos-
                itives  but  more  false negatives. AUC is the area under this
                receiver operating characteristic curve and so provides an ag-
                gregated  measure of the model performance across all possible
                classification thresholds. The AUC score can  also  be  inter-
                preted  as  the  probability that a randomly selected positive
                data point is more likely to be predicted positive than a ran-
                domly  selected negative example. AUC scores vary between zero
                and one: a score of one indicates perfect accuracy and a score
                of one half indicates that the prediction is not better than a
                random classifier. Values under one half  predict  less  accu-
                rately than a random predictor. But such consistently bad pre-
                dictors can simply be inverted to obtain  better  than  random
                predictors.

              o F1macro  :  The F1macro score applies F1 scoring to multiclass
                classification. In this context, you have multiple classes  to
                predict.  You just calculate the precision and recall for each
                class as you did for the positive class in binary  classifica-
                tion.  Then,  use  these  values to calculate the F1 score for
                each class and average  them  to  obtain  the  F1macro  score.
                F1macro  scores  vary  between zero and one: one indicates the
                best possible performance and zero the worst.

              If you do not specify a metric explicitly, the default  behavior
              is to automatically use:

              o MSE : for regression.

              o F1 : for binary classification

              o Accuracy : for multiclass classification.

                 stopped automatically and its processing is ended gracefully.
                 The  AutoML  job identifies the best model whose training was
                 completed and marks it as the best-performing model. Any  un-
                 finished  steps  of  the job, such as automatic one-click Au-
                 topilot model deployment, will not be completed.

                 than 0 and less than 1. We recommend setting this value to be
                 less than 0.5.

          CandidateGenerationConfig -> (structure)
              The  configuration  for generating a candidate for an AutoML job
              (optional).

          {
            "AutoGenerateEndpointName": true|false,
            "EndpointName": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
