LIST-PROCESSING-JOBS()                                  LIST-PROCESSING-JOBS()



NAME
       list-processing-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists processing jobs that satisfy various filters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-processing-jobs  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: ProcessingJobSummaries

OPTIONS
       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only processing jobs created after the  speci-
          fied time.

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A  filter that returns only processing jobs created after the speci-
          fied time.

       --last-modified-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only processing jobs modified after the speci-
          fied time.

       --last-modified-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only processing jobs modified before the spec-
          ified time.

       --name-contains (string)
          A string in the processing job name. This filter returns  only  pro-
          cessing jobs whose name contains the specified string.

       --status-equals (string)
          A filter that retrieves only processing jobs with a specific status.

          Possible values:

          o InProgress

          o Completed

          o Failed

          o Stopping

          o Stopped

       --sort-by (string)
          The field to sort results by. The default is CreationTime .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

          o Status

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for results. The default is Ascending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ProcessingJobSummaries -> (list)
          An array of ProcessingJobSummary objects, each listing a  processing
          job.

          (structure)
              Summary of information about a processing job.

              ProcessingJobName -> (string)
                 The name of the processing job.

              ProcessingJobArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the processing job..

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the processing job was created.

              ProcessingEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the processing job completed.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  timestamp  that indicates the last time the processing job
                 was modified.

              ProcessingJobStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the processing job.

              FailureReason -> (string)
                 A string, up to one KB in size, that contains  the  reason  a
                 processing job failed, if it failed.

              ExitMessage -> (string)
                 An optional string, up to one KB in size, that contains meta-
                 data from the processing container when  the  processing  job
                 exits.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  response is truncated, Amazon SageMaker returns this token.
          To retrieve the next set of processing jobs, use it  in  the  subse-
          quent request.
