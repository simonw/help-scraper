LIST-COMPILATION-JOBS()                                LIST-COMPILATION-JOBS()



NAME
       list-compilation-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists model compilation jobs that satisfy various filters.

       To  create  a model compilation job, use  CreateCompilationJob . To get
       information about a particular model compilation job you have  created,
       use  DescribeCompilationJob .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-compilation-jobs  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: CompilationJobSummaries

OPTIONS
       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns the model compilation jobs that  were  created
          after a specified time.

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A  filter  that returns the model compilation jobs that were created
          before a specified time.

       --last-modified-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns the model compilation jobs that were  modified
          after a specified time.

       --last-modified-time-before (timestamp)
          A  filter that returns the model compilation jobs that were modified
          before a specified time.

       --name-contains (string)
          A filter that returns the model compilation jobs whose name contains
          a specified string.

       --status-equals (string)
          A  filter that retrieves model compilation jobs with a specific  De-
          scribeCompilationJobResponse$CompilationJobStatus status.

          Possible values:

          o INPROGRESS

          o COMPLETED

          o FAILED

          o STARTING

          o STOPPING

          o STOPPED

       --sort-by (string)
          The field by which to sort results. The default is CreationTime .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

          o Status

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for results. The default is Ascending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 pilation job has completed.

              CompilationTargetPlatformOs -> (string)
