LIST-FLOW-DEFINITIONS()                                LIST-FLOW-DEFINITIONS()



NAME
       list-flow-definitions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about the flow definitions in your account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-flow-definitions  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: FlowDefinitionSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-flow-definitions
          [--creation-time-after <value>]
          [--creation-time-before <value>]
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only flow definitions  with  a  creation  time
          greater than or equal to the specified timestamp.

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only flow definitions that were created before
          the specified timestamp.

       --sort-order (string)
          An optional value that specifies whether you want the results sorted
          in Ascending or Descending order.

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FlowDefinitionSummaries -> (list)
          An array of objects describing the flow definitions.

          (structure)
              Contains summary information about the flow definition.

              FlowDefinitionName -> (string)
                 The name of the flow definition.

              FlowDefinitionArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the flow definition.

              FlowDefinitionStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the flow definition. Valid values:

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp when SageMaker created the flow definition.

              FailureReason -> (string)
                 The reason why the flow definition creation failed. A failure
                 reason is returned only when the flow  definition  status  is
                 Failed .

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token to resume pagination.
