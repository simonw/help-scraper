OPTIONS
       --processing-job-name (string)
          The  name  of  the processing job. The name must be unique within an
          Amazon Web Services Region in the Amazon Web Services account.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       ProcessingInputs -> (list)
          The inputs for a processing job.

          (structure)
              The inputs for a processing job. The processing input must spec-
              ify exactly one of either S3Input or DatasetDefinition types.

              InputName -> (string)
                 The name for the processing job input.

              AppManaged -> (boolean)
                 When True , input operations such as data download  are  man-
                 aged  natively  by the processing job application. When False
                 (default), input operations are managed by Amazon SageMaker.

              S3Input -> (structure)
                 Configuration for downloading input data from Amazon S3  into
                 the processing container.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     The  URI  of  the Amazon S3 prefix Amazon SageMaker down-
                     loads data required to run a processing job.

                 LocalPath -> (string)
                     The local path in your container where  you  want  Amazon
                     SageMaker  to  write input data to. LocalPath is an abso-
                     lute  path  to  the  input  data  and  must  begin   with
                     /opt/ml/processing/  .  LocalPath is a required parameter
                     when AppManaged is False (default).

                 S3DataType -> (string)
                     Whether you use an S3Prefix or  a  ManifestFile  for  the
                     data  type.  If  you choose S3Prefix , S3Uri identifies a
                     key name prefix. Amazon SageMaker uses all  objects  with
                     the  specified key name prefix for the processing job. If
                     you choose ManifestFile , S3Uri identifies an object that
                     is  a manifest file containing a list of object keys that
                     you want Amazon SageMaker to use for the processing job.

                 S3InputMode -> (string)
                     Whether to use File or Pipe input  mode.  In  File  mode,
                     Amazon  SageMaker  copies  the data from the input source
                     onto the local ML storage  volume  before  starting  your
                     processing  container. This is the most commonly used in-
                     put mode. In Pipe mode, Amazon  SageMaker  streams  input
                     data  from  the  source  directly to your processing con-
                     tainer into named pipes without using the ML storage vol-
                     ume.

                 S3DataDistributionType -> (string)
                     Whether to distribute the data from Amazon S3 to all pro-
                     cessing instances with FullyReplicated , or  whether  the
                     data from Amazon S3 is shared by Amazon S3 key, download-
                     ing one shard of data to each processing instance.

                 S3CompressionType -> (string)
                     Whether to GZIP-decompress the data in Amazon S3 as it is
                     streamed  into the processing container. Gzip can only be
                     used when Pipe mode is specified as the S3InputMode .  In
                     Pipe  mode,  Amazon SageMaker streams input data from the
                     source directly to your container without using  the  EBS
                     volume.

              DatasetDefinition -> (structure)
                 Configuration for a Dataset Definition input.

                     OutputS3Uri -> (string)
                        The location in Amazon S3 where the Redshift query re-
                        sults are stored.

                     KmsKeyId -> (string)
                        The Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon
                        Web Services KMS) key that Amazon  SageMaker  uses  to

                 LocalPath -> (string)
                     The  local  path where you want Amazon SageMaker to down-
                     load the Dataset Definition inputs to  run  a  processing
                     job.  LocalPath  is  an  absolute path to the input data.
                     This is a required parameter  when  AppManaged  is  False

                     Whether  the  generated  dataset  is  FullyReplicated  or
                     ShardedByS3Key (default).

                 InputMode -> (string)
                     Whether to use File or Pipe input mode. In File (default)
                     mode,  Amazon  SageMaker  copies  the data from the input
                     source onto the local Amazon Elastic Block Store  (Amazon
                     EBS)  volumes  before  starting  your training algorithm.
                     This is the most commonly used input mode. In Pipe  mode,
                     Amazon  SageMaker  streams input data from the source di-

                 AppManaged -> (boolean)
                     When True , output operations such  as  data  upload  are
                     managed  natively by the processing job application. When
                     False (default), output operations are managed by  Amazon
                     SageMaker.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              The  Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Ser-
              vices KMS) key that Amazon SageMaker uses to  encrypt  the  pro-
              cessing job output. KmsKeyId can be an ID of a KMS key, ARN of a
              KMS key, alias of a KMS key, or alias of a KMS key. The KmsKeyId
              is applied to all outputs.

       ProcessingJobName -> (string)
          The  name  of  the processing job. The name must be unique within an
          Amazon Web Services Region in the Amazon Web Services account.

       ProcessingResources -> (structure)
          Identifies the resources, ML compute instances, and ML storage  vol-
          umes  to  deploy  for a processing job. In distributed training, you
          specify more than one instance.

          ClusterConfig -> (structure)
              The configuration for the resources in a cluster used to run the
              processing job.

              InstanceCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of ML compute instances to use in the processing
                 job. For distributed processing jobs, specify a value greater
                 than 1. The default value is 1.

              InstanceType -> (string)
                 The ML compute instance type for the processing job.

              VolumeSizeInGB -> (integer)
                 The  size of the ML storage volume in gigabytes that you want
                 to provision. You must specify sufficient ML storage for your
                 scenario.

                 NOTE:
                     Certain  Nitro-based instances include local storage with
                     a fixed total size, dependent on the instance type.  When
                     using  these  instances  for processing, Amazon SageMaker
                     mounts the local instance storage instead of  Amazon  EBS
                     gp2  storage.  You can't request a VolumeSizeInGB greater
                     than the total size of the local instance storage.

                     For a list of instance types that support local  instance
                     storage,  including the total size per instance type, see
                     Instance Store Volumes .

              VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Key Management  Service  (Amazon  Web
                 Services  KMS) key that Amazon SageMaker uses to encrypt data
                 on the storage volume attached to the ML compute  instance(s)
                 that run the processing job.

                 NOTE:
                     Certain  Nitro-based instances include local storage, de-
                     pendent on the instance type. Local storage  volumes  are
                     encrypted  using  a  hardware module on the instance. You
                     can't request a VolumeKmsKeyId  when  using  an  instance
                     type with local storage.

                     For  a list of instance types that support local instance
                     storage, see Instance Store Volumes .

                     For more information about local instance storage encryp-
                     tion, see SSD Instance Store Volumes .
