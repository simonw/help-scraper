CREATE-TRIAL()                                                  CREATE-TRIAL()



NAME
       create-trial -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  SageMaker  trial  . A trial is a set of steps called trial
       components that produce a machine learning model. A trial is part of  a
       single SageMaker experiment .

       When  you use SageMaker Studio or the SageMaker Python SDK, all experi-
       ments, trials, and trial components are automatically tracked,  logged,
       and  indexed.  When  you  use  the  Amazon  Web Services SDK for Python
       (Boto), you must use the logging APIs provided by the SDK.

       You can add tags to a trial and then use the  Search API to search  for
       the tags.

       To  get  a list of all your trials, call the  ListTrials API. To view a
       trial's properties, call the  DescribeTrial API. To create a trial com-
       ponent, call the  CreateTrialComponent API.

SYNOPSIS
            create-trial
          --trial-name <value>
          [--display-name <value>]
          --experiment-name <value>
          [--metadata-properties <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --trial-name (string)
          The  name  of  the trial. The name must be unique in your Amazon Web
          Services account and is not case-sensitive.

       --display-name (string)
          The name of the trial as displayed. The  name  doesn't  need  to  be
          unique. If DisplayName isn't specified, TrialName is displayed.

       --experiment-name (string)
          The name of the experiment to associate the trial with.

       --metadata-properties (structure)
          Metadata  properties  of the tracking entity, trial, or trial compo-
          nent.

          CommitId -> (string)
              The commit ID.

          Repository -> (string)
              The repository.

          GeneratedBy -> (string)
              The entity this entity was generated by.

          ProjectId -> (string)
              The project ID.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CommitId=string,Repository=string,GeneratedBy=string,ProjectId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CommitId": "string",
            "Repository": "string",
            "GeneratedBy": "string",
            "ProjectId": "string"
          }

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags to associate with the trial. You can use  Search  API
          to search on the tags.

          (structure)
              A  tag object that consists of a key and an optional value, used
              to manage metadata for SageMaker Amazon Web Services resources.

              You can add tags to notebook instances, training jobs,  hyperpa-
              rameter  tuning  jobs,  batch  transform  jobs, models, labeling
              jobs, work teams, endpoint configurations,  and  endpoints.  For
              more information on adding tags to SageMaker resources, see  Ad-
              dTags .

              For more information on adding metadata to your Amazon Web  Ser-
              vices  resources  with  tagging, see Tagging Amazon Web Services
              resources . For advice on best practices for managing Amazon Web
              Services resources with tagging, see Tagging Best Practices: Im-
              plement an Effective Amazon Web Services Resource Tagging Strat-
              egy .

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag key. Tag keys must be unique per resource.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TrialArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the trial.
