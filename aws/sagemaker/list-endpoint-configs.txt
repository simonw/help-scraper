LIST-ENDPOINT-CONFIGS()                                LIST-ENDPOINT-CONFIGS()



NAME
       list-endpoint-configs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists endpoint configurations.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-endpoint-configs  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: EndpointConfigs

SYNOPSIS
            list-endpoint-configs
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--name-contains <value>]
          [--creation-time-before <value>]
          [--creation-time-after <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --sort-by (string)
          The field to sort results by. The default is CreationTime .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for results. The default is Descending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --name-contains (string)
          A string in the endpoint configuration  name.  This  filter  returns
          only  endpoint  configurations  whose  name  contains  the specified
          string.

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only endpoint  configurations  created  before
          the specified time (timestamp).

       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A  filter  that returns only endpoint configurations with a creation
          time greater than or equal to the specified time (timestamp).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EndpointConfigs -> (list)
          An array of endpoint configurations.

          (structure)
              Provides summary information for an endpoint configuration.

              EndpointConfigName -> (string)
                 The name of the endpoint configuration.

              EndpointConfigArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint configuration.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp that shows when the  endpoint  configuration  was
                 created.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  response is truncated, SageMaker returns this token. To re-
          trieve the next set of endpoint configurations, use it in the subse-
          quent request
