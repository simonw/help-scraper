LIST-MODEL-PACKAGES()                                    LIST-MODEL-PACKAGES()



NAME
       list-model-packages -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the model packages that have been created.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-model-packages is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: ModelPackageSummaryList

OPTIONS
       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only model packages created after  the  speci-
          fied time (timestamp).

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A  filter that returns only model packages created before the speci-
          fied time (timestamp).

       --name-contains (string)
          A string in the model package name. This filter returns  only  model
          packages whose name contains the specified string.

       --model-approval-status (string)
          A filter that returns only the model packages with the specified ap-
          proval status.

          Possible values:

          o Approved

          o Rejected

          o PendingManualApproval

       --model-package-group-name (string)
          A filter that returns only model versions that belong to the  speci-
          fied model group.

       --model-package-type (string)
          A filter that returns only the model packages of the specified type.
          This can be one of the following values.

          o UNVERSIONED - List only unversioined models. This is  the  default
            value if no ModelPackageType is specified.

          o VERSIONED - List only versioned models.

          o BOTH - List both versioned and unversioned models.

          Possible values:

          o Versioned

          o Unversioned

          o Both

       --sort-by (string)
          The parameter by which to sort the results. The default is Creation-
          Time .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for the results. The default is Ascending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ModelPackageSummaryList -> (list)
          An array of ModelPackageSummary objects, each of which lists a model
          package.

          (structure)
              Provides summary information about a model package.

              ModelPackageName -> (string)
                 The name of the model package.

              ModelPackageGroupName -> (string)
                 If  the  model  package is a versioned model, the model group
                 that the versioned model belongs to.

              ModelPackageVersion -> (integer)
                 If the model package is a versioned model, the version of the
                 model.

              ModelPackageArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the model package.

              ModelPackageDescription -> (string)
                 A brief description of the model package.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp that shows when the model package was created.

              ModelPackageStatus -> (string)
                 The overall status of the model package.

              ModelApprovalStatus -> (string)
                 The approval status of the model. This can be one of the fol-
                 lowing values.

                 o APPROVED - The model is approved

                 o REJECTED - The model is rejected.

                 o PENDING_MANUAL_APPROVAL - The model is waiting  for  manual
                   approval.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  response is truncated, Amazon SageMaker returns this token.
          To retrieve the next set of model packages, use it in the subsequent
          request.
