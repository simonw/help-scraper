LIST-TRAINING-JOBS()                                      LIST-TRAINING-JOBS()



NAME
       list-training-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists training jobs.

       NOTE:
          When  StatusEquals  and  MaxResults  are  set  at the same time, the
          MaxResults number of training jobs are first retrieved ignoring  the
          StatusEquals  parameter  and  then they are filtered by the StatusE-
          quals parameter, which is returned as a response.

          For example, if ListTrainingJobs is invoked with the  following  pa-
          rameters:
              { ... MaxResults: 100, StatusEquals: InProgress ... }

          First,  100  trainings  jobs  with any status, including those other
          than InProgress , are selected (sorted  according  to  the  creation
          time,  from the most current to the oldest). Next, those with a sta-
          tus of InProgress are returned.

          You can quickly test the API using the following Amazon Web Services
          CLI code.
              aws   sagemaker   list-training-jobs  --max-results  100  --sta-
              tus-equals InProgress

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-training-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: TrainingJobSummaries

OPTIONS
       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only training jobs created after the specified
          time (timestamp).

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only training jobs created before  the  speci-
          fied time (timestamp).

       --last-modified-time-after (timestamp)
          A  filter  that returns only training jobs modified after the speci-
          fied time (timestamp).

       --last-modified-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only training jobs modified before the  speci-
          fied time (timestamp).

       --name-contains (string)
          A string in the training job name. This filter returns only training
          jobs whose name contains the specified string.

       --status-equals (string)
          A filter that retrieves only training jobs with a specific status.

          Possible values:

          o InProgress

          o Completed

          o Failed

          o Stopping

          o Stopped

       --sort-by (string)
          The field to sort results by. The default is CreationTime .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

          o Status

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for results. The default is Ascending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TrainingJobSummaries -> (list)
          An array of TrainingJobSummary objects, each listing a training job.

          (structure)
              Provides summary information about a training job.

              TrainingJobName -> (string)
                 The name of the training job that you want a summary for.

              TrainingJobArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the training job.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp that shows when the training job was created.

              TrainingEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp that shows when  the  training  job  ended.  This
                 field is set only if the training job has one of the terminal
                 statuses (Completed , Failed , or Stopped ).

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 Timestamp when the training job was last modified.

              TrainingJobStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the training job.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, SageMaker returns this token.  To  re-
          trieve  the  next set of training jobs, use it in the subsequent re-
          quest.
