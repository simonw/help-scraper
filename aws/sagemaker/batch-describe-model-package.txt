NAME
       batch-describe-model-package -

DESCRIPTION
       This action batch describes a list of versioned model packages

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-describe-model-package
          --model-package-arn-list <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --model-package-arn-list (list)
          The list of Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the model package groups.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                            If you are using your own custom algorithm instead
                            of an algorithm provided by Amazon SageMaker,  the

                            istry/repository[:tag]     and    registry/reposi-
                            tory[@digest] image path formats. For more  infor-
                            mation,  see Using Your Own Algorithms with Amazon
