NAME
       list-model-package-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of the model groups in your Amazon Web Services account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-model-package-groups  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: ModelPackageGroupSummaryList

SYNOPSIS
            list-model-package-groups
          [--creation-time-after <value>]
          [--creation-time-before <value>]
          [--name-contains <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only model groups created after the  specified
          time.

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only model groups created before the specified
          time.

       --name-contains (string)
          A string in the model group name. This  filter  returns  only  model
          groups whose name contains the specified string.

       --sort-by (string)
          The field to sort results by. The default is CreationTime .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for results. The default is Ascending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ModelPackageGroupSummaryList -> (list)
          A  list of summaries of the model groups in your Amazon Web Services
          account.

          (structure)
              Summary information about a model group.

              ModelPackageGroupName -> (string)
                 The name of the model group.

              ModelPackageGroupArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the model group.

              ModelPackageGroupDescription -> (string)
                 A description of the model group.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the model group was created.

              ModelPackageGroupStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the model group.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, SageMaker returns this token.  To  re-
          trieve  the  next  set of model groups, use it in the subsequent re-
          quest.
