NAME
       describe-labeling-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about a labeling job.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-labeling-job
          --labeling-job-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --labeling-job-name (string)
          The name of the labeling job to return information for.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                       this value when the object is a text value.

                     If you are a new user of Ground Truth, it is  recommended
                     you review Use an Input Manifest File in the Amazon Sage-
                     Maker Developer Guide to learn how  to  create  an  input

              Attributes of the data specified by the customer.

              ContentClassifiers -> (list)
                 Declares that your content is free of personally identifiable
                 information or adult content. SageMaker may restrict the Ama-
                 zon Mechanical Turk workers that can view your task based  on
                 this information.

                 (string)

       OutputConfig -> (structure)
          The  location  of  the job's output data and the Amazon Web Services
          Key Management Service key ID for the key used to encrypt the output
          data, if any.

          S3OutputPath -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 location to write output data.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Web  Services  Key Management Service ID of the key
              used to encrypt the output data, if any.

              If you provide your own KMS key ID, you must  add  the  required
              permissions to your KMS key described in Encrypt Output Data and
              Storage Volume with Amazon Web Services KMS .

              If you don't provide a KMS key ID, Amazon SageMaker uses the de-
              fault  Amazon Web Services KMS key for Amazon S3 for your role's
              account to encrypt your output data.

              If you use a bucket policy with an s3:PutObject permission  that
              only  allows objects with server-side encryption, set the condi-
              tion key of s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption to "aws:kms"  .  For
              more  information, see KMS-Managed Encryption Keys in the Amazon
              Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.

          SnsTopicArn -> (string)
              An Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) output  topic
              ARN.  Provide a SnsTopicArn if you want to do real time chaining
              to another streaming job and receive an Amazon SNS notifications
              each time a data object is submitted by a worker.

              If  you  provide  an  SnsTopicArn in OutputConfig , when workers
              complete labeling tasks, Ground Truth will  send  labeling  task
              output data to the SNS output topic you specify here.

                 named entity recognition, 3D point cloud and video frame  la-
                 beling jobs. Use your labeling job task type to select one of
                 the following ARNs and use it with this  parameter  when  you
                 create a labeling job. Replace aws-region with the Amazon Web
                 Services Region you are creating your labeling  job  in.  For

          TaskKeywords -> (list)
              Keywords used to describe the task so that workers on Amazon Me-
              chanical Turk can discover the task.

              (string)

          TaskTitle -> (string)
              A title for the task for your human workers.

          TaskDescription -> (string)
              A description of the task for your human workers.

          NumberOfHumanWorkersPerDataObject -> (integer)
              The number of human workers that will label an object.

          TaskTimeLimitInSeconds -> (integer)
              The amount of time that a worker has to complete a task.

              If you create a custom labeling job, the maximum value for  this
              parameter is 8 hours (28,800 seconds).

              If you create a labeling job using a built-in task type the max-
              imum for this parameter depends on the task type you use:

              o For image and text labeling  jobs,  the  maximum  is  8  hours
                (28,800 seconds).

              o For  3D point cloud and video frame labeling jobs, the maximum
                is 30 days (2952,000 seconds) for non-AL mode. For most users,
                the maximum is also 30 days.

          TaskAvailabilityLifetimeInSeconds -> (integer)
              The length of time that a task remains available for labeling by
              human workers. The default and maximum values for this parameter
              depend on the type of workforce you use.

              o If  you choose the Amazon Mechanical Turk workforce, the maxi-
                mum is 12 hours (43,200  seconds).  The  default  is  6  hours
                (21,600 seconds).

              o If you choose a private or vendor workforce, the default value
                is 30 days (2592,000 seconds) for non-AL mode. For most users,
                the maximum is also 30 days.

          MaxConcurrentTaskCount -> (integer)
              Defines  the  maximum number of data objects that can be labeled
              by human workers at the same time. Also  referred  to  as  batch
              size. Each object may have more than one worker at one time. The
              default value is 1000 objects.

          AnnotationConsolidationConfig -> (structure)
              Configures how labels are consolidated across human workers.

              AnnotationConsolidationLambdaArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a  Lambda  function  imple-
                 ments  the  logic for annotation consolidation and to process
                 output data.

                 This  parameter  is  required  for  all  labeling  jobs.  For
                 built-in  task  types , use one of the following Amazon Sage-
                 Maker Ground Truth Lambda function ARNs for AnnotationConsol-
                 idationLambdaArn   .   For  custom  labeling  workflows,  see
                 Post-annotation Lambda .
