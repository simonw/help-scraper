NAME
       describe-auto-ml-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about an Amazon SageMaker AutoML job.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-auto-ml-job
          --auto-ml-job-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --auto-ml-job-name (string)
          Requests information about an AutoML job using its unique name.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          in Amazon S3.

       AutoMLJobObjective -> (structure)
          Returns the job's objective.

          MetricName -> (string)
              The name of the objective metric used to measure the  predictive
              quality  of  a machine learning system. This metric is optimized
              during training to provide the best estimate for model parameter
              values from data.

              Here are the options:

              o MSE  :  The  mean  squared  error  (MSE) is the average of the
                squared differences between the predicted and  actual  values.
                It is used for regression. MSE values are always positive: the
                better a model is at predicting the actual values, the smaller
                the  MSE  value is. When the data contains outliers, they tend
                to dominate the MSE, which might cause subpar prediction  per-
                formance.

              o Accuracy  :  The  ratio  of the number of correctly classified
                items to the total number of (correctly and incorrectly) clas-
                sified items. It is used for binary and multiclass classifica-
                tion. It measures how close the predicted class values are  to
                the  actual values. Accuracy values vary between zero and one:
                one indicates perfect accuracy and zero indicates perfect  in-
                accuracy.

              o F1  :  The  F1 score is the harmonic mean of the precision and
                recall. It is used for binary classification into classes tra-
                ditionally  referred  to as positive and negative. Predictions
                are said to be true when they  match  their  actual  (correct)
                class  and  false  when they do not. Precision is the ratio of
                the true positive predictions to all positive predictions (in-
                cluding  the  false  positives) in a data set and measures the
                quality of the prediction when it predicts the positive class.
                Recall (or sensitivity) is the ratio of the true positive pre-
                dictions to all actual positive  instances  and  measures  how
                completely a model predicts the actual class members in a data
                set.  The  standard  F1  score  weighs  precision  and  recall
                equally.  But  which  metric is paramount typically depends on
                specific aspects of a problem. F1 scores vary between zero and
                one:  one indicates the best possible performance and zero the
                worst.

              o AUC : The area under the curve (AUC) metric is used to compare
                and  evaluate  binary classification by algorithms such as lo-
                gistic regression that return probabilities.  A  threshold  is
                needed to map the probabilities into classifications. The rel-
                evant curve is the  receiver  operating  characteristic  curve
                that plots the true positive rate (TPR) of predictions (or re-
                call) against the false positive rate (FPR) as a  function  of
                the  threshold  value,  above which a prediction is considered
                positive. Increasing the threshold results in fewer false pos-
                itives  but  more  false negatives. AUC is the area under this
                receiver operating characteristic curve and so provides an ag-
                gregated  measure of the model performance across all possible
                classification thresholds. The AUC score can  also  be  inter-
                preted  as  the  probability that a randomly selected positive
                data point is more likely to be predicted positive than a ran-
                domly  selected negative example. AUC scores vary between zero
                and one: a score of one indicates perfect accuracy and a score
                of one half indicates that the prediction is not better than a
                random classifier. Values under one half  predict  less  accu-
                rately than a random predictor. But such consistently bad pre-
                dictors can simply be inverted to obtain  better  than  random
                predictors.

              o F1macro  :  The F1macro score applies F1 scoring to multiclass
                classification. In this context, you have multiple classes  to
                predict.  You just calculate the precision and recall for each
                class as you did for the positive class in binary  classifica-
                tion.  Then,  use  these  values to calculate the F1 score for
                each class and average  them  to  obtain  the  F1macro  score.
                F1macro  scores  vary  between zero and one: one indicates the
                best possible performance and zero the worst.

              If you do not specify a metric explicitly, the default  behavior
              is to automatically use:

              o MSE : for regression.

              o F1 : for binary classification

              o Accuracy : for multiclass classification.

                 If  an  AutoML  job  exceeds  the maximum runtime, the job is
                 stopped automatically and its processing is ended gracefully.
                 The  AutoML  job identifies the best model whose training was
                 completed and marks it as the best-performing model. Any  un-

          AutoMLJobObjective -> (structure)
              Specifies a metric to minimize or maximize as the objective of a
              job.

              MetricName -> (string)
                 The name of the objective metric used to measure the  predic-
                 tive quality of a machine learning system. This metric is op-
                 timized during training to  provide  the  best  estimate  for
                 model parameter values from data.

                 Here are the options:

                 o MSE  :  The  mean squared error (MSE) is the average of the
                   squared differences between the predicted and  actual  val-
                   ues. It is used for regression. MSE values are always posi-
                   tive: the better a model is at predicting the  actual  val-
                   ues,  the  smaller the MSE value is. When the data contains
                   outliers, they tend to dominate the MSE, which might  cause
                   subpar prediction performance.

                 o Accuracy  : The ratio of the number of correctly classified
                   items to the total number of  (correctly  and  incorrectly)
                   classified  items.  It  is  used  for binary and multiclass
                   classification. It measures how close the  predicted  class
                   values  are  to the actual values. Accuracy values vary be-
                   tween zero and one: one indicates perfect accuracy and zero
                   indicates perfect inaccuracy.

                 o F1 : The F1 score is the harmonic mean of the precision and
                   recall. It is used for binary classification  into  classes
                   traditionally referred to as positive and negative. Predic-
                   tions are said to be true  when  they  match  their  actual
                   (correct)  class  and  false when they do not. Precision is
                   the ratio of the true positive predictions to all  positive
                   predictions  (including  the false positives) in a data set
                   and measures the quality of the prediction when it predicts
                   the positive class. Recall (or sensitivity) is the ratio of
                   the true positive predictions to all  actual  positive  in-
                   stances  and  measures  how completely a model predicts the
                   actual class members in a data set. The standard  F1  score
                   weighs  precision  and  recall equally. But which metric is
                   paramount typically depends on specific aspects of a  prob-
                   lem. F1 scores vary between zero and one: one indicates the
                   best possible performance and zero the worst.

                 o AUC : The area under the curve (AUC) metric is used to com-
                   pare  and evaluate binary classification by algorithms such
                   as logistic regression that return probabilities. A thresh-
                   old  is  needed  to  map the probabilities into classifica-
                   tions. The relevant curve is the receiver operating charac-
                   teristic  curve  that plots the true positive rate (TPR) of
                   predictions (or recall) against  the  false  positive  rate
                   (FPR)  as  a function of the threshold value, above which a
                   prediction is considered positive. Increasing the threshold
                   results  in fewer false positives but more false negatives.
                   AUC is the area under this receiver operating  characteris-
                   tic  curve  and  so  provides  an aggregated measure of the
                   model  performance  across  all   possible   classification
                   thresholds.  The  AUC  score can also be interpreted as the
                   probability that a randomly selected positive data point is
                   more  likely  to  be predicted positive than a randomly se-
                   lected negative example. AUC scores vary between  zero  and
                   one:  a score of one indicates perfect accuracy and a score
                   of one half indicates that the  prediction  is  not  better
                   than  a  random  classifier.  Values under one half predict
                   less accurately than a random predictor. But  such  consis-
                   tently bad predictors can simply be inverted to obtain bet-
                   ter than random predictors.

                 o F1macro : The F1macro score applies F1  scoring  to  multi-
                   class  classification.  In  this context, you have multiple
                   classes to predict. You just calculate  the  precision  and
                   recall  for each class as you did for the positive class in
                   binary classification. Then, use these values to  calculate
                   the  F1 score for each class and average them to obtain the
                   F1macro score. F1macro scores vary between  zero  and  one:
                   one  indicates  the  best possible performance and zero the
                   worst.

                 If you do not specify a metric explicitly, the default behav-
                 ior is to automatically use:

                 o MSE : for regression.

                 o F1 : for binary classification

                 o Accuracy : for multiclass classification.

          ProblemType -> (string)
              The problem type.

          CompletionCriteria -> (structure)
              How  long  a job is allowed to run, or how many candidates a job
              is allowed to generate.

              MaxCandidates -> (integer)
                 The maximum number of times a training job is allowed to run.

              MaxRuntimePerTrainingJobInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The maximum time, in seconds, that each training job  is  al-
                 lowed to run as part of a hyperparameter tuning job. For more
                 information, see the used by the action.

              MaxAutoMLJobRuntimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The maximum runtime, in seconds, an AutoML job  has  to  com-
                 plete.

                 If  an  AutoML  job  exceeds  the maximum runtime, the job is
                 stopped automatically and its processing is ended gracefully.
                 The  AutoML  job identifies the best model whose training was
                 completed and marks it as the best-performing model. Any  un-
                 finished  steps  of  the job, such as automatic one-click Au-
                 topilot model deployment, will not be completed.

       ModelDeployConfig -> (structure)
          Indicates whether the model was deployed automatically  to  an  end-
          point and the name of that endpoint if deployed automatically.

          AutoGenerateEndpointName -> (boolean)
              Set  to  True  to  automatically generate an endpoint name for a
              one-click Autopilot model deployment; set  to  False  otherwise.
              The default value is False .

              NOTE:
                 If  you set AutoGenerateEndpointName to True , do not specify
                 the EndpointName ; otherwise a 400 error is thrown.

          EndpointName -> (string)
              Specifies the endpoint name to use  for  a  one-click  Autopilot
              model deployment if the endpoint name is not generated automati-
              cally.

              NOTE:
                 Specify the EndpointName if and only if you  set  AutoGenera-
                 teEndpointName to False ; otherwise a 400 error is thrown.

       ModelDeployResult -> (structure)
          Provides information about endpoint for the model deployment.

          EndpointName -> (string)
              The name of the endpoint to which the model has been deployed.

              NOTE:
                 If model deployment fails, this field is omitted from the re-
                 sponse.
