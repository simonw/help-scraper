NAME
       describe-model-package -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a description of the specified model package, which is used to
       create SageMaker models or list them on  Amazon  Web  Services  Market-
       place.

       To  create  models in SageMaker, buyers can subscribe to model packages
       listed on Amazon Web Services Marketplace.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-model-package
          --model-package-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --model-package-name (string)
          The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the model package  to  de-
          scribe.

          When  you  specify  a  name,  the name must have 1 to 63 characters.
          Valid characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and - (hyphen).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                               S3DataType -> (string)
                                   If you choose S3Prefix , S3Uri identifies a
                                   key  name prefix. Amazon SageMaker uses all
                                   objects with the specified key name  prefix
                                   for batch transform.

                                   If  you choose ManifestFile , S3Uri identi-
                                   fies an object that is a manifest file con-
                                   taining a list of object keys that you want
                                   Amazon SageMaker to use  for  batch  trans-
                                   form.

                                   The  following values are compatible: Mani-
                                   festFile , S3Prefix

                                   The following value is not compatible: Aug-

                               S3Uri -> (string)
                                   Depending  on  the  value specified for the
                                   S3DataType , identifies either a  key  name
                                   prefix or a manifest. For example:

                                   o A  key  name prefix might look like this:
                                     s3://bucketname/exampleprefix .

                                   o A  manifest   might   look   like   this:
                                     s3://bucketname/example.manifest      The
                                     manifest is an S3 object which is a  JSON
                                     file   with  the  following  format:    [
                                     {"prefix":                     "s3://cus-
                                     tomer_bucket/some/prefix/"},       "rela-

                                     tive/path/custdata-N"    ]   The  preced-
                                     ing  JSON  matches the following S3Uris :
                                     s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/rela-
                                     tive/path/to/custdata-1         s3://cus-

                                     tive/path/custdata-N    The  complete set
                                     of S3Uris in  this  manifest  constitutes
                                     the  input  data for the channel for this
                                     datasource. The object that  each  S3Uris
                                     points  to  must  be  readable by the IAM
                                     role that Amazon SageMaker uses  to  per-
                                     form tasks on your behalf.

                        ContentType -> (string)
                            The  multipurpose  internet  mail extension (MIME)
                            type of the data. Amazon SageMaker uses  the  MIME
                            type  with  each http call to transfer data to the
                            transform job.

                        CompressionType -> (string)
                            If your transform data is compressed, specify  the
                            compression  type.  Amazon SageMaker automatically
                            decompresses the data for the  transform  job  ac-
                            cordingly. The default value is None .

                        SplitType -> (string)
                            The  method  to  use  to split the transform job's
                            data files into smaller batches. Splitting is nec-
                            essary  when  the total size of each object is too
                            large to fit in a single request. You can also use
                            data  splitting to improve performance by process-
                            ing multiple concurrent mini-batches. The  default
                            value for SplitType is None , which indicates that
                            input data files are not split, and  request  pay-
                            loads  contain the entire contents of an input ob-
                            ject. Set the value of this parameter to  Line  to
                            split  records  on  a  newline character boundary.
                            SplitType also supports a  number  of  record-ori-
                            ented  binary  data  formats.  Currently, the sup-
                            ported record formats are:

                            o RecordIO

                            o TFRecord

                            When  splitting  is  enabled,  the   size   of   a
                            mini-batch  depends  on  the  values of the Batch-
                            Strategy and MaxPayloadInMB parameters.  When  the
                            value  of  BatchStrategy  is  MultiRecord , Amazon
                            SageMaker sends the maximum number of  records  in
                            each  request,  up to the MaxPayloadInMB limit. If
                            the value of BatchStrategy is SingleRecord ,  Ama-
                            zon SageMaker sends individual records in each re-
                            quest.

                            NOTE:
                               Some data formats represent a record as  a  bi-
                               nary  payload wrapped with extra padding bytes.
                               When splitting is applied to a binary data for-
                               mat,  padding is removed if the value of Batch-
                               Strategy is set to SingleRecord  .  Padding  is
                               not  removed  if  the value of BatchStrategy is
                               set to MultiRecord .

                     TransformOutput -> (structure)
                        Identifies the Amazon S3 location where you want  Ama-
                        zon  SageMaker  to save the results from the transform
                        job.

                        S3OutputPath -> (string)
                            The Amazon S3 path where you want Amazon SageMaker
                            to store the results of the transform job. For ex-
                            ample, s3://bucket-name/key-name-prefix .

                            For every S3 object used as input for  the  trans-
                            form  job,  batch transform stores the transformed
                            data with an .``out`` suffix  in  a  corresponding
                            subfolder  in  the  location in the output prefix.
                            For  example,  for  the  input  data   stored   at
                            s3://bucket-name/input-name-pre-
                            fix/dataset01/data.csv ,  batch  transform  stores
                            the   transformed  data  at  s3://bucket-name/out-
                            put-name-prefix/input-name-prefix/data.csv.out   .
                            Batch transform doesn't upload partially processed
                            objects. For an input S3 object that contains mul-
                            tiple records, it creates an .``out`` file only if
                            the transform job succeeds  on  the  entire  file.
                            When  the  input contains multiple S3 objects, the
                            batch transform job processes the  listed  S3  ob-
                            jects and uploads only the output for successfully
                            processed objects. If  any  object  fails  in  the
                            transform  job  batch  transform  marks the job as
                            failed to prompt investigation.

                        Accept -> (string)
                            The MIME type used to  specify  the  output  data.
                            Amazon SageMaker uses the MIME type with each http
                            call to transfer data from the transform job.

                        AssembleWith -> (string)
                            Defines how to assemble the results of the  trans-
                            form  job  as  a single S3 object. Choose a format
                            that is most convenient to you. To concatenate the
                            results  in binary format, specify None . To add a
                            newline character at the end of every  transformed
                            record, specify Line .

                        KmsKeyId -> (string)
                            The  Amazon  Web  Services  Key Management Service
                            (Amazon Web Services KMS) key  that  Amazon  Sage-
                            Maker  uses to encrypt the model artifacts at rest
                            using  Amazon  S3  server-side   encryption.   The
                            KmsKeyId can be any of the following formats:

                            o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

                            o Key                                         ARN:
                              arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

                            o Alias name: alias/ExampleAlias

                            o Alias                  name                 ARN:

                              pleAlias

                            If  you  don't  provide a KMS key ID, Amazon Sage-
                            Maker uses the default KMS key for Amazon  S3  for
                            your  role's  account.  For  more information, see

                            The  KMS  key  policy must grant permission to the
                            IAM role that you specify in your CreateModel  re-

                     TransformResources -> (structure)
                        Identifies  the ML compute instances for the transform
                        job.

                        InstanceType -> (string)
                            The ML compute instance  type  for  the  transform
                            job.  If  you  are  using  built-in  algorithms to
                            transform moderately sized datasets, we  recommend
                            using ml.m4.xlarge or ml.m5.large instance types.

                        InstanceCount -> (integer)
                            The  number  of ML compute instances to use in the
                            transform job.  For  distributed  transform  jobs,
                            specify  a value greater than 1. The default value
                            is 1 .

                        VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
                            The Amazon Web  Services  Key  Management  Service
                            (Amazon  Web  Services  KMS) key that Amazon Sage-
                            Maker uses to encrypt model data  on  the  storage
                            volume attached to the ML compute instance(s) that
                            run the batch transform job.

                            NOTE:
                               Certain  Nitro-based  instances  include  local
                               storage,  dependent on the instance type. Local
                               storage volumes are encrypted using a  hardware
                               module  on  the  instance.  You can't request a
                               VolumeKmsKeyId when using an instance type with
                               local storage.

                               For a list of instance types that support local
                               instance storage, see Instance Store Volumes .

                            The VolumeKmsKeyId can be  any  of  the  following
                            formats:

                            o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
