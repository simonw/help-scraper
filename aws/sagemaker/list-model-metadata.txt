LIST-MODEL-METADATA()                                    LIST-MODEL-METADATA()



NAME
       list-model-metadata -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  domain, framework, task, and model name of standard machine
       learning models found in common model zoos.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-model-metadata is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: ModelMetadataSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-model-metadata
          [--search-expression <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --search-expression (structure)
          One  or more filters that searches for the specified resource or re-
          sources in a search. All resource objects that satisfy  the  expres-
          sion's  condition  are  included  in the search results. Specify the
          Framework, FrameworkVersion, Domain or  Task  to  filter  supported.
          Filter names and values are case-sensitive.

          Filters -> (list)
              A list of filter objects.

              (structure)
                 Part  of  the search expression. You can specify the name and
                 value (domain, task, framework, framework version, task,  and
                 model).

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of the of the model to filter by.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value to filter the model metadata.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Filters=[{Name=string,Value=string},{Name=string,Value=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Filters": [
              {
                "Name": "Domain"|"Framework"|"Task"|"FrameworkVersion",
                "Value": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ModelMetadataSummaries -> (list)
          A structure that holds model metadata.

          (structure)
              A summary of the model metadata.

              Domain -> (string)
                 The machine learning domain of the model.

              Framework -> (string)
                 The machine learning framework of the model.

              Task -> (string)
                 The machine learning task of the model.

              Model -> (string)
                 The name of the model.

              FrameworkVersion -> (string)
                 The framework version of the model.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  for  getting the next set of recommendations, if there are
          any.
