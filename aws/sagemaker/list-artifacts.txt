LIST-ARTIFACTS()                                              LIST-ARTIFACTS()



NAME
       list-artifacts -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the artifacts in your account and their properties.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-artifacts  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: ArtifactSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-artifacts
          [--source-uri <value>]
          [--artifact-type <value>]
          [--created-after <value>]
          [--created-before <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-uri (string)
          A filter that returns only artifacts with the specified source URI.

       --artifact-type (string)
          A filter that returns only artifacts of the specified type.

       --created-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only artifacts created on or after the  speci-
          fied time.

       --created-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only artifacts created on or before the speci-
          fied time.

       --sort-by (string)
          The property used to sort results. The default value is CreationTime
          .

          Possible values:

          o CreationTime

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order. The default value is Descending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          A list of artifacts and their properties.

          (structure)
              Lists  a  summary  of the properties of an artifact. An artifact
              represents a URI addressable object or data. Some examples are a
              dataset and a model.

              ArtifactArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the artifact.

                 SourceUri -> (string)
                     The URI of the source.

                 SourceTypes -> (list)
                     A list of source types.

                     (structure)
                        The ID and ID type of an artifact source.

                        SourceIdType -> (string)
                            The type of ID.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The ID.

              ArtifactType -> (string)
                 The type of the artifact.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the artifact was created.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the artifact was last modified.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token for getting the next set of artifacts, if there are any.
