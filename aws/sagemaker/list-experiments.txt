LIST-EXPERIMENTS()                                          LIST-EXPERIMENTS()



NAME
       list-experiments -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all the experiments in your account. The list can be filtered to
       show only experiments that were created in a specific time  range.  The
       list can be sorted by experiment name or creation time.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-experiments  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: ExperimentSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-experiments
          [--created-after <value>]
          [--created-before <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --created-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only experiments created after  the  specified
          time.

       --created-before (timestamp)
          A  filter that returns only experiments created before the specified
          time.

       --sort-by (string)
          The property used to sort results. The default value is CreationTime
          .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order. The default value is Descending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ExperimentSummaries -> (list)
          A list of the summaries of your experiments.

          (structure)
              A summary of the properties of an experiment. To  get  the  com-
              plete  set  of  properties, call the  DescribeExperiment API and
              provide the ExperimentName .

              ExperimentArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the experiment.

              ExperimentName -> (string)
                 The name of the experiment.

              DisplayName -> (string)
                 The name of the experiment as displayed. If DisplayName isn't
                 specified, ExperimentName is displayed.

              ExperimentSource -> (structure)
                 The source of the experiment.

                 SourceArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source.

                 SourceType -> (string)
                     The source type.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the experiment was created.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the experiment was last modified.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token for getting the next set of experiments, if there are any.
