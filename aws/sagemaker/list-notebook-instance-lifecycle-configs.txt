LIST-NOTEBOOK-INSTANCE-LIFECYCLE-CONLIST-NOTEBOOK-INSTANCE-LIFECYCLE-CONFIGS()



NAME
       list-notebook-instance-lifecycle-configs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists notebook instance lifestyle configurations created with the  Cre-
       ateNotebookInstanceLifecycleConfig API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-notebook-instance-lifecycle-configs is a paginated operation. Mul-
       tiple  API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set
       of results. You can disable pagination by providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: NotebookInstanceLifecycleConfigs

OPTIONS
       --sort-by (string)
          Sorts the list of results. The default is CreationTime .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

          o LastModifiedTime

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for results.

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --name-contains (string)
          A  string  in  the lifecycle configuration name. This filter returns
          only lifecycle configurations  whose  name  contains  the  specified
          string.

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A  filter  that returns only lifecycle configurations that were cre-
          ated before the specified time (timestamp).

       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only lifecycle configurations that  were  cre-
          ated after the specified time (timestamp).

       --last-modified-time-before (timestamp)
          A  filter that returns only lifecycle configurations that were modi-
          fied before the specified time (timestamp).

       --last-modified-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only lifecycle configurations that were  modi-
          fied after the specified time (timestamp).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  response is truncated, Amazon SageMaker returns this token.
          To get the next set of lifecycle configurations, use it in the  next
          request.

       NotebookInstanceLifecycleConfigs -> (list)
          An  array  of  NotebookInstanceLifecycleConfiguration  objects, each
          listing a lifecycle configuration.

          (structure)
              Provides a summary of a notebook instance  lifecycle  configura-
              tion.

              NotebookInstanceLifecycleConfigName -> (string)
                 The name of the lifecycle configuration.

              NotebookInstanceLifecycleConfigArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the lifecycle configura-
                 tion.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp that tells when the lifecycle  configuration  was
                 created.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  timestamp  that tells when the lifecycle configuration was
                 last modified.
