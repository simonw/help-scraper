OPTIONS
       --monitoring-schedule-name (string)
          The name of the monitoring schedule. The name must be unique  within
          an Amazon Web Services Region within an Amazon Web Services account.

       --monitoring-schedule-config (structure)
          The  configuration object that specifies the monitoring schedule and
          defines the monitoring job.

          ScheduleConfig -> (structure)
              Configures the monitoring schedule.

              ScheduleExpression -> (string)
                 A cron expression that describes details about the monitoring
                 schedule.

                 Currently the only supported cron expressions are:

                 o If  you want to set the job to start every hour, please use
                   the following:  Hourly: cron(0 * ? * * *)

                 o If you want to start the job daily:  cron(0 [00-23] ?  *  *
                   *)

                 For example, the following are valid cron expressions:

                 o Daily at noon UTC: cron(0 12 ? * * *)

                 o Daily at midnight UTC: cron(0 0 ? * * *)

                 To  support running every 6, 12 hours, the following are also
                 supported:
                     cron(0 [00-23]/[01-24] ? * * *)

                 For example, the following are valid cron expressions:

                 o Every 12 hours, starting at 5pm UTC: cron(0 17/12 ? * * *)

                 o Every two hours starting at midnight: cron(0 0/2 ? * * *)

                 NOTE:

                     o Even though the cron expression is set to start at  5PM
                       UTC,  note  that there could be a delay of 0-20 minutes
                       from the actual requested time to run the execution.

                     o We recommend that if you would like a  daily  schedule,
                       you  do  not  provide  this parameter. Amazon SageMaker
                       will pick a time for running every day.

                        the  job.  For  data quality and model explainability,
                        this can be up to 3600 seconds for an hourly schedule.
                        For  model  bias  and  model quality hourly schedules,

                     Encryption provides greater security for distributed pro-
                     cessing jobs, but the processing might take longer.

                     Whether  to  allow  inbound and outbound network calls to

                     Specifies a VPC that your training jobs and hosted models
                     have  access to. Control access to and from your training
                     and model containers by configuring the VPC. For more in-

       --tags (list)
          (Optional) An array of key-value pairs. For more information, see
          `Using Cost Allocation Tags < https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html#allocation-whatURL>`__
           in the Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost Management User Guide .

          (structure)
              A  tag object that consists of a key and an optional value, used
              to manage metadata for SageMaker Amazon Web Services resources.

              You can add tags to notebook instances, training jobs,  hyperpa-
              rameter  tuning  jobs,  batch  transform  jobs, models, labeling
              jobs, work teams, endpoint configurations,  and  endpoints.  For
              more  information  on  adding  tags  to SageMaker resources, see
              AddTags .

              For more information on adding metadata to your Amazon Web  Ser-
              vices  resources  with  tagging, see Tagging Amazon Web Services
              resources . For advice on best practices for managing Amazon Web
              Services resources with tagging, see Tagging Best Practices: Im-
              plement an Effective Amazon Web Services Resource Tagging Strat-
              egy .

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag key. Tag keys must be unique per resource.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
