       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that Amazon  SageMaker
          can assume to perform tasks on your behalf.

       --stopping-condition (structure)
          A  time  limit for how long the monitoring job is allowed to run be-
          fore stopping.

          MaxRuntimeInSeconds -> (integer)
              The maximum runtime allowed in seconds.

              NOTE:
                 The MaxRuntimeInSeconds cannot exceed the  frequency  of  the
                 job.  For  data quality and model explainability, this can be
                 up to 3600 seconds for an hourly schedule. For model bias and
                 model  quality  hourly schedules, this can be up to 1800 sec-
                 onds.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MaxRuntimeInSeconds=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MaxRuntimeInSeconds": integer
          }

       --tags (list)
          (Optional) An array of key-value pairs. For  more  information,  see
          Using  Cost  Allocation  Tags in the Amazon Web Services Billing and
          Cost Management User Guide .

          (structure)
              A tag object that consists of a key and an optional value,  used
              to manage metadata for SageMaker Amazon Web Services resources.

              You  can add tags to notebook instances, training jobs, hyperpa-
              rameter tuning jobs,  batch  transform  jobs,  models,  labeling
              jobs,  work  teams,  endpoint configurations, and endpoints. For
              more information on adding  tags  to  SageMaker  resources,  see
              AddTags .

              vices resources with tagging, see Tagging  Amazon  Web  Services
              resources . For advice on best practices for managing Amazon Web
              Services resources with tagging, see Tagging Best Practices: Im-
              plement an Effective Amazon Web Services Resource Tagging Strat-
              egy .

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag key. Tag keys must be unique per resource.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",

            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
