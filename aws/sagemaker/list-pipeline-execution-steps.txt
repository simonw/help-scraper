NAME
       list-pipeline-execution-steps -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of PipeLineExecutionStep objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-pipeline-execution-steps  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: PipelineExecutionSteps

OPTIONS
       --pipeline-execution-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the pipeline execution.

       --sort-order (string)
          The field by which to sort results. The default is CreatedTime .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                        The Amazon S3 URI of the violation  report  if  viola-
                        tions are detected.

                     CheckJobArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the check processing
                        job that was run by this step's execution.

                     SkipCheck -> (boolean)
                        This flag indicates if the  drift  check  against  the
                        previous baseline will be skipped or not. If it is set
                        to False , the previous  baseline  of  the  configured
                        check type must be available.

                     RegisterNewBaseline -> (boolean)
                        This flag indicates if a newly calculated baseline can
                        be accessed through step  properties  BaselineUsedFor-
                        DriftCheckConstraints  and  BaselineUsedForDriftCheck-
                        Statistics . If it is set  to  False  ,  the  previous
                        baseline  of  the  configured  check type must also be
                        available. These can be  accessed  through  the  Base-
                        lineUsedForDriftCheckConstraints property.

                 Fail -> (structure)
                     The configurations and outcomes of a Fail step execution.

                     ErrorMessage -> (string)
                        A  message  that  you define and then is processed and
                        rendered by the Fail step when the error occurs.

                 AutoMLJob -> (structure)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AutoML job that was
                     run by this step.

                     Arn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AutoML job.

                 Endpoint -> (structure)
                     The endpoint that was invoked during this step execution.

                     Arn -> (string)
                        The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint in the
                        step.

                 EndpointConfig -> (structure)
                     The endpoint configuration used  to  create  an  endpoint
                     during this step execution.

                     Arn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint config-
                        uration used in the step.

              AttemptCount -> (integer)
                 The current attempt of the execution step. For more  informa-
                 tion, see Retry Policy for SageMaker Pipelines steps .

              SelectiveExecutionResult -> (structure)
                 The  ARN from an execution of the current pipeline from which
                 results are reused for this step.

                 SourcePipelineExecutionArn -> (string)
                     The ARN from an execution of the current pipeline.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the result of the previous ListPipelineExecutionSteps request was
          truncated,  the response includes a NextToken . To retrieve the next
          set of pipeline execution steps, use the token in the next request.
