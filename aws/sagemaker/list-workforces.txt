LIST-WORKFORCES()                                            LIST-WORKFORCES()



NAME
       list-workforces -

DESCRIPTION
       Use this operation to list all private and vendor workforces in an Ama-
       zon Web Services Region. Note that you can only have one private  work-
       force per Amazon Web Services Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-workforces is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Workforces

SYNOPSIS
            list-workforces
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--name-contains <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --sort-by (string)
          Sort workforces using the workforce name or creation date.

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreateDate

       --sort-order (string)
          Sort workforces in ascending or descending order.

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --name-contains (string)
          A filter you can use to search for  workforces  using  part  of  the
          workforce name.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Workforces -> (list)
          A list containing information about your workforce.

          (structure)
              A  single private workforce, which is automatically created when
              you create your first private work team. You can create one pri-
              vate  work force in each Amazon Web Services Region. By default,
              any workforce-related API operation used in  a  specific  region
              will apply to the workforce created in that region. To learn how
              to create a private workforce, see Create a Private Workforce .

                 The name of the private workforce.

              WorkforceArn -> (string)

                 A list of one to ten IP address ranges (CIDRs ) to  be  added

                     A list of  one  to  ten  Classless  Inter-Domain  Routing
