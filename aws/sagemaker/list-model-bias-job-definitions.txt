LIST-MODEL-BIAS-JOB-DEFINITIONS()            LIST-MODEL-BIAS-JOB-DEFINITIONS()



NAME
       list-model-bias-job-definitions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists model bias jobs definitions that satisfy various filters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-model-bias-job-definitions  is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: JobDefinitionSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-model-bias-job-definitions
          [--endpoint-name <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--name-contains <value>]
          [--creation-time-before <value>]
          [--creation-time-after <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --endpoint-name (string)
          Name of the endpoint to monitor for model bias.

       --sort-by (string)
          Whether to sort results by the Name or CreationTime field.  The  de-
          fault is CreationTime .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

       --sort-order (string)
          Whether  to  sort  the results in Ascending or Descending order. The
          default is Descending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --name-contains (string)
          Filter for model bias jobs whose name contains a specified string.

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only model bias jobs created before  a  speci-
          fied time.

       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only model bias jobs created after a specified
          time.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       JobDefinitionSummaries -> (list)
          A  JSON  array  in  which each element is a summary for a model bias
          jobs.

          (structure)
              Summary information about a monitoring job.

              MonitoringJobDefinitionName -> (string)
                 The name of the monitoring job.

              MonitoringJobDefinitionArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the monitoring job.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the monitoring job was created.

              EndpointName -> (string)
                 The name of the endpoint that the job monitors.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, Amazon SageMaker returns  this  token.
          To retrieve the next set of jobs, use it in the subsequent request.
