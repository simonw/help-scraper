LIST-EDGE-PACKAGING-JOBS()                          LIST-EDGE-PACKAGING-JOBS()



NAME
       list-edge-packaging-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of edge packaging jobs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-edge-packaging-jobs  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: EdgePackagingJobSummaries

       --last-modified-time-before (timestamp)
          Select jobs where the job was updated before specified time.

       --name-contains (string)
          Filter for jobs containing this name in their packaging job name.

       --model-name-contains (string)
          Filter for jobs where the model name contains this string.

       --status-equals (string)
          The job status to filter for.

          Possible values:

          o STARTING

          o INPROGRESS

          o COMPLETED

          o FAILED

          o STOPPING

          o STOPPED

       --sort-by (string)
          Use to specify what column to sort by.

          Possible values:

          o NAME

          o MODEL_NAME

          o CREATION_TIME

          o LAST_MODIFIED_TIME

          o STATUS

       --sort-order (string)
          What direction to sort by.

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
