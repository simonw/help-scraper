NAME
       list-studio-lifecycle-configs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  Studio Lifecycle Configurations in your Amazon Web Services
       Account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-studio-lifecycle-configs is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: StudioLifecycleConfigs

OPTIONS
       --name-contains (string)
          A  string  in  the Lifecycle Configuration name. This filter returns
          only Lifecycle Configurations  whose  name  contains  the  specified
          string.

       --app-type-equals (string)
          A  parameter  to search for the App Type to which the Lifecycle Con-
          figuration is attached.

          Possible values:

          o JupyterServer

          o KernelGateway

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only Lifecycle Configurations  created  on  or
          before the specified time.

       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A  filter  that  returns only Lifecycle Configurations created on or
          after the specified time.

       --modified-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only Lifecycle Configurations modified  before
          the specified time.

       --modified-time-after (timestamp)
          A  filter  that returns only Lifecycle Configurations modified after
          the specified time.

       --sort-by (string)
          The property used to sort results. The default  value  is  Creation-
          Time.

          Possible values:

          o CreationTime

          o LastModifiedTime

          o Name

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order. The default value is Descending.

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          A token for getting the next set of actions, if there are any.

       StudioLifecycleConfigs -> (list)
          A list of Lifecycle Configurations and their properties.

          (structure)
              Details of the Studio Lifecycle Configuration.

              StudioLifecycleConfigArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  Lifecycle  Configura-
                 tion.

              StudioLifecycleConfigName -> (string)
                 The name of the Studio Lifecycle Configuration.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The creation time of the Studio Lifecycle Configuration.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 This value is equivalent to CreationTime because Studio Life-
                 cycle Configurations are immutable.

              StudioLifecycleConfigAppType -> (string)
                 The App type to which  the  Lifecycle  Configuration  is  at-
                 tached.
