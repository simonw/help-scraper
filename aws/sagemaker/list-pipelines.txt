LIST-PIPELINES()                                              LIST-PIPELINES()



NAME
       list-pipelines -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of pipelines.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-pipelines  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: PipelineSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-pipelines
          [--pipeline-name-prefix <value>]
          [--created-after <value>]
          [--created-before <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pipeline-name-prefix (string)
          The prefix of the pipeline name.

       --created-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns the pipelines that were created after a speci-
          fied time.

       --created-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns the pipelines that were created before a spec-
          ified time.

       --sort-by (string)
          The field by which to sort results. The default is CreatedTime .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for results.

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PipelineSummaries -> (list)
          Contains a sorted list of PipelineSummary objects matching the spec-
          ified filters. Each PipelineSummary consists of PipelineArn, Pipeli-
          neName, ExperimentName, PipelineDescription, CreationTime, LastModi-
          fiedTime, LastRunTime, and RoleArn. This list can be empty.

          (structure)
              A summary of a pipeline.

              PipelineArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the pipeline.

              PipelineName -> (string)
                 The name of the pipeline.

              PipelineDisplayName -> (string)
                 The display name of the pipeline.

              PipelineDescription -> (string)
                 The description of the pipeline.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that the pipeline used to exe-
                 cute.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The creation time of the pipeline.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the pipeline was last modified.

              LastExecutionTime -> (timestamp)
                 The last time that a pipeline execution began.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  result of the previous ListPipelines request was truncated,
          the response includes a NextToken . To  retrieve  the  next  set  of
          pipelines, use the token in the next request.
