NAME
       describe-monitoring-schedule -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the schedule for a monitoring job.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-monitoring-schedule
          --monitoring-schedule-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --monitoring-schedule-name (string)
          Name of a previously created monitoring schedule.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       MonitoringScheduleArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the monitoring schedule.

       MonitoringScheduleName -> (string)
          Name of the monitoring schedule.

       MonitoringScheduleStatus -> (string)
          The status of an monitoring job.

       MonitoringType -> (string)
          The type of the monitoring job that this schedule runs. This is  one
          of the following values.

          o DATA_QUALITY - The schedule is for a data quality monitoring job.

          o MODEL_QUALITY  -  The  schedule  is for a model quality monitoring
            job.

          o MODEL_BIAS - The schedule is for a bias monitoring job.

          o MODEL_EXPLAINABILITY - The schedule is for an explainability moni-
            toring job.

       FailureReason -> (string)
          A  string, up to one KB in size, that contains the reason a monitor-
          ing job failed, if it failed.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The time at which the monitoring job was created.

       LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
          The time at which the monitoring job was last modified.

       MonitoringScheduleConfig -> (structure)
          The configuration object that specifies the monitoring schedule  and
          defines the monitoring job.

          ScheduleConfig -> (structure)
              Configures the monitoring schedule.

              ScheduleExpression -> (string)
                 A cron expression that describes details about the monitoring
                 schedule.

                 Currently the only supported cron expressions are:

                 o If you want to set the job to start every hour, please  use
                   the following:  Hourly: cron(0 * ? * * *)

                 o If  you  want to start the job daily:  cron(0 [00-23] ? * *
                   *)

                 For example, the following are valid cron expressions:

                 o Daily at noon UTC: cron(0 12 ? * * *)

                 o Daily at midnight UTC: cron(0 0 ? * * *)

                 To support running every 6, 12 hours, the following are  also
                 supported:
                     cron(0 [00-23]/[01-24] ? * * *)

                 For example, the following are valid cron expressions:

                 o Every 12 hours, starting at 5pm UTC: cron(0 17/12 ? * * *)

                 o Every two hours starting at midnight: cron(0 0/2 ? * * *)

                 NOTE:

                     o Even  though the cron expression is set to start at 5PM
                       UTC, note that there could be a delay of  0-20  minutes
                       from the actual requested time to run the execution.

                     o We  recommend  that if you would like a daily schedule,
                       you do not provide  this  parameter.  Amazon  SageMaker
                       will pick a time for running every day.

                     convert  it into a flatted json so that the built-in con-
                     tainer can use the converted data.  Applicable  only  for

                        the  job.  For  data quality and model explainability,
                        this can be up to 3600 seconds for an hourly schedule.
                        For  model  bias  and  model quality hourly schedules,
                        this can be up to 1800 seconds.

                     cessing jobs, but the processing might take longer.

                 EnableNetworkIsolation -> (boolean)
                     Whether  to  allow  inbound and outbound network calls to
