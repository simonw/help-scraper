GENERATE-DATA-KEY-PAIR()                              GENERATE-DATA-KEY-PAIR()



NAME
       generate-data-key-pair -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a unique asymmetric data key pair for use outside of KMS. This
       operation returns a plaintext public key, a plaintext private key,  and
       a copy of the private key that is encrypted under the symmetric encryp-
       tion KMS key you specify. You can use the  data  key  pair  to  perform
       asymmetric  cryptography  and  implement  digital signatures outside of
       KMS. The bytes in the keys are random; they not related to  the  caller
       or to the KMS key that is used to encrypt the private key.

       You  can use the public key that GenerateDataKeyPair returns to encrypt
       data or verify a signature outside of KMS. Then,  store  the  encrypted
       private key with the data. When you are ready to decrypt data or sign a
       message, you can use the  Decrypt operation to  decrypt  the  encrypted
       private key.

       To  generate  a  data key pair, you must specify a symmetric encryption
       KMS key to encrypt the private key in a data key pair. You  cannot  use
       an  asymmetric  KMS  key or a KMS key in a custom key store. To get the
       type and origin of your KMS key, use the  DescribeKey operation.

       Use the KeyPairSpec parameter to choose an RSA or Elliptic Curve  (ECC)
       data  key  pair.  In China Regions, you can also choose an SM2 data key
       pair. KMS recommends that you use ECC key pairs for  signing,  and  use
       RSA  and  SM2 key pairs for either encryption or signing, but not both.
       However, KMS cannot enforce any restrictions on the  use  of  data  key
       pairs outside of KMS.

       If  you  are using the data key pair to encrypt data, or for any opera-
       tion where you don't immediately need a private key, consider using the
       GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext operation. GenerateDataKeyPairWith-
       outPlaintext returns a plaintext public key and  an  encrypted  private
       key,  but omits the plaintext private key that you need only to decrypt
       ciphertext or sign a message. Later, when you need to decrypt the  data
       or  sign a message, use the  Decrypt operation to decrypt the encrypted
       private key in the data key pair.
          GenerateDataKeyPair returns a unique data key pair for each request.
          The bytes in the keys are random; they are not related to the caller
          or the KMS key that is used to encrypt the private key.  The  public
          key is a DER-encoded X.509 SubjectPublicKeyInfo, as specified in RFC
          5280 . The private key is a  DER-encoded  PKCS8  PrivateKeyInfo,  as
          specified in RFC 5958 .

       You  can  use an optional encryption context to add additional security
       to the encryption operation. If you specify an EncryptionContext ,  you
       must specify the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match)
       when decrypting the encrypted data key. Otherwise, the request  to  de-
       crypt  fails with an InvalidCiphertextException . For more information,
       see Encryption Context in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

       The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key
       state.  For  details,  see Key states of KMS keys in the Key Management
       Service Developer Guide .
          Cross-account use : Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key in
          a  different  Amazon  Web  Services  account, specify the key ARN or
          alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.

SYNOPSIS
            generate-data-key-pair
          [--encryption-context <value>]
          --key-id <value>
          --key-pair-spec <value>
          [--grant-tokens <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --encryption-context (map)
          Specifies the encryption context that will be used  when  encrypting
          the private key in the data key pair.

          An  encryption context is a collection of non-secret key-value pairs
          that represent additional authenticated data. When you  use  an  en-
          cryption  context to encrypt data, you must specify the same (an ex-
          act case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data. An
          encryption  context  is  supported only on operations with symmetric
          encryption KMS keys. On operations  with  symmetric  encryption  KMS
          keys,  an  encryption context is optional, but it is strongly recom-
          mended.

          For more information, see Encryption context in the  Key  Management
          Service Developer Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --key-id (string)
          Specifies the symmetric encryption KMS key that encrypts the private
          key in the data key pair. You cannot specify an asymmetric  KMS  key
          or  a  KMS  key in a custom key store. To get the type and origin of
          your KMS key, use the  DescribeKey operation.

          To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or  alias
          ARN.  When using an alias name, prefix it with "alias/" . To specify
          a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you  must  use
          the key ARN or alias ARN.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Alias name: alias/ExampleAlias

          o Alias ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias

          To  get  the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys or  De-
          scribeKey . To get the alias name and alias ARN, use  ListAliases .

       --key-pair-spec (string)
          Determines the type of data key pair that is generated.

          The KMS rule that restricts the use of asymmetric RSA  and  SM2  KMS
          keys  to  encrypt  and decrypt or to sign and verify (but not both),
          and the rule that permits you to use ECC KMS keys only to  sign  and
          verify,  are not effective on data key pairs, which are used outside
          of KMS. The SM2 key spec is only available in China Regions. RSA and
          ECC asymmetric key pairs are also available in China Regions.

          Possible values:

          o RSA_2048

          o RSA_3072

          o RSA_4096

          o ECC_NIST_P256

          o ECC_NIST_P384

          o ECC_NIST_P521

          o ECC_SECG_P256K1

          o SM2

       --grant-tokens (list)
          A list of grant tokens.

          Use  a grant token when your permission to call this operation comes
          from a new grant that has not yet achieved  eventual  consistency  .
          For more information, see Grant token and Using a grant token in the
          Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
