GENERATE-DATA-KEY-PAIR-WITHOUT-PLAINGENERATE-DATA-KEY-PAIR-WITHOUT-PLAINTEXT()



NAME
       generate-data-key-pair-without-plaintext -

DESCRIPTION
       Generates  a  unique asymmetric data key pair. The GenerateDataKeyPair-
       WithoutPlaintext operation returns a plaintext public key and a copy of
       the private key that is encrypted under the symmetric KMS key you spec-
       ify. Unlike  GenerateDataKeyPair , this operation  does  not  return  a
       plaintext private key.

       You can use the public key that GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext re-
       turns to encrypt data or verify a signature outside of KMS. Then, store
       the  encrypted private key with the data. When you are ready to decrypt
       data or sign a message, you can use the  Decrypt operation  to  decrypt
       the encrypted private key.

       To  generate  a  data key pair, you must specify a symmetric KMS key to
       encrypt the private key in a data key pair. You cannot use an  asymmet-
       ric  KMS  key  or  a KMS key in a custom key store. To get the type and
       origin of your KMS key, use the  DescribeKey operation.

       Use the KeyPairSpec parameter to choose an RSA or Elliptic Curve  (ECC)
       data  key pair. KMS recommends that your use ECC key pairs for signing,
       and use RSA key pairs for either encryption or signing, but  not  both.
       However,  KMS  cannot  enforce  any restrictions on the use of data key
       pairs outside of KMS.
          GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext returns a unique data  key  pair
          for each request. The bytes in the key are not related to the caller
          or KMS key that is used to encrypt the private key. The  public  key
          is  a  DER-encoded  X.509  SubjectPublicKeyInfo, as specified in RFC
          5280 .

       You can use the optional encryption context to add additional  security
       to  the encryption operation. If you specify an EncryptionContext , you
       must specify the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match)
       when  decrypting  the encrypted data key. Otherwise, the request to de-
       crypt fails with an InvalidCiphertextException . For more  information,
       see Encryption Context in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

       The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key
       state. For details, see Key state: Effect on your KMS key  in  the  Key
       Management Service Developer Guide .
          Cross-account use : Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key in
          a different Amazon Web Services account,  specify  the  key  ARN  or
          alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.

SYNOPSIS
            generate-data-key-pair-without-plaintext
          [--encryption-context <value>]
          --key-id <value>
          --key-pair-spec <value>
          [--grant-tokens <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --encryption-context (map)
          Specifies the encryption context that will be used  when  encrypting
          the private key in the data key pair.

          An  encryption context is a collection of non-secret key-value pairs
          that represents additional authenticated data. When you use  an  en-
          cryption  context to encrypt data, you must specify the same (an ex-
          act case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data. An
          encryption  context is optional when encrypting with a symmetric KMS
          key, but it is highly recommended.

          For more information, see Encryption Context in the  Key  Management
          Service Developer Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --key-id (string)
          Specifies  the KMS key that encrypts the private key in the data key
          pair. You must specify a symmetric KMS key. You cannot use an  asym-
          metric  KMS  key or a KMS key in a custom key store. To get the type
          and origin of your KMS key, use the  DescribeKey operation.

          To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or  alias
          ARN.  When using an alias name, prefix it with "alias/" . To specify
          a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you  must  use
          the key ARN or alias ARN.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Alias name: alias/ExampleAlias

          o Alias ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias

          To  get  the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys or  De-
          scribeKey . To get the alias name and alias ARN, use  ListAliases .

       --key-pair-spec (string)
          Determines the type of data key pair that is generated.

          The KMS rule that restricts the use of asymmetric RSA  KMS  keys  to
          encrypt  and  decrypt  or to sign and verify (but not both), and the
          rule that permits you to use ECC KMS keys only to sign  and  verify,
          are not effective on data key pairs, which are used outside of KMS.

          Possible values:

          o RSA_2048

          o RSA_3072

          o RSA_4096

          o ECC_NIST_P256

          o ECC_NIST_P384

          o ECC_NIST_P521

          o ECC_SECG_P256K1

       --grant-tokens (list)
          A list of grant tokens.

          Use  a grant token when your permission to call this operation comes
          from a new grant that has not yet achieved  eventual  consistency  .
          For more information, see Grant token and Using a grant token in the
          Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PrivateKeyCiphertextBlob -> (blob)
          The  encrypted copy of the private key. When you use the HTTP API or
          the Amazon Web Services CLI, the value is Base64-encoded. Otherwise,
          it is not Base64-encoded.

       PublicKey -> (blob)
          The public key (in plaintext).

       KeyId -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (key ARN ) of the KMS key that encrypted
          the private key.

       KeyPairSpec -> (string)
          The type of data key pair that was generated.
