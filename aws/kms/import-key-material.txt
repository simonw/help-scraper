IMPORT-KEY-MATERIAL()                                    IMPORT-KEY-MATERIAL()



NAME
       import-key-material -

DESCRIPTION
       Imports  key  material  into an existing symmetric KMS KMS key that was
       created without key material. After you successfully import  key  mate-
       rial  into  a KMS key, you can reimport the same key material into that
       KMS key, but you cannot import different key material.

       You cannot perform this operation on an asymmetric KMS key  or  on  any
       KMS  key  in a different Amazon Web Services account. For more informa-
       tion about creating KMS keys with no key material  and  then  importing
       key  material, see Importing Key Material in the Key Management Service
       Developer Guide .

       Before using this operation, call   GetParametersForImport  .  Its  re-
       sponse includes a public key and an import token. Use the public key to
       encrypt the key material. Then, submit the import token from  the  same
       GetParametersForImport response.

       When calling this operation, you must specify the following values:

       o The  key  ID or key ARN of a KMS key with no key material. Its Origin
         must be EXTERNAL . To create a KMS key with  no  key  material,  call
         CreateKey  and set the value of its Origin parameter to EXTERNAL . To
         get the Origin of a KMS key, call  DescribeKey .)

       o The encrypted key material. To get the public key to encrypt the  key
         material, call  GetParametersForImport .

       o The  import token that  GetParametersForImport returned. You must use
         a public key and token from the same GetParametersForImport response.

       o Whether the key material expires and if so, when. If you set an expi-
         ration  date,  KMS  deletes  the key material from the KMS key on the
         specified date, and the KMS key becomes unusable. To use the KMS  key
         again,  you  must  reimport  the  same  key material. The only way to
         change an expiration date is by reimporting the same key material and
         specifying a new expiration date.

       When this operation is successful, the key state of the KMS key changes
       from PendingImport to Enabled , and you can use the KMS key.

       If this operation fails, use the exception to help determine the  prob-
       lem.  If the error is related to the key material, the import token, or
       wrapping key, use  GetParametersForImport to get a new public  key  and
       import token for the KMS key and repeat the import procedure. For help,
       see How To Import Key Material in the Key Management Service  Developer
       Guide .

       The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key
       state. For details, see Key state: Effect on your KMS key  in  the  Key
       Management Service Developer Guide .
          Cross-account  use  : No. You cannot perform this operation on a KMS
          key in a different Amazon Web Services account.

SYNOPSIS
            import-key-material
          --key-id <value>
          --import-token <value>
          --encrypted-key-material <value>
          [--valid-to <value>]
          [--expiration-model <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          The identifier of the symmetric KMS key that receives  the  imported
          key  material.  The KMS key's Origin must be EXTERNAL . This must be
          the same KMS key specified in the KeyID parameter of the correspond-
          ing  GetParametersForImport request.

          Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          To  get  the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys or  De-
          scribeKey .

       --import-token (blob)
          The import token that you received in the  response  to  a  previous
          GetParametersForImport  request.  It  must be from the same response
          that contained the public key that you used to encrypt the key mate-
          rial.

       --encrypted-key-material (blob)
          The  encrypted  key material to import. The key material must be en-
          crypted with the public wrapping  key  that   GetParametersForImport
          returned,  using  the  wrapping  algorithm that you specified in the
          same GetParametersForImport request.

       --valid-to (timestamp)
          The time at which the imported key material expires.  When  the  key
          material  expires,  KMS deletes the key material and the KMS key be-
          comes unusable. You must omit this parameter  when  the  Expiration-
          Model  parameter  is set to KEY_MATERIAL_DOES_NOT_EXPIRE . Otherwise
          it is required.

       --expiration-model (string)
          Specifies whether the key material expires. The default is KEY_MATE-
          RIAL_EXPIRES , in which case you must include the ValidTo parameter.
          When this parameter is set  to  KEY_MATERIAL_DOES_NOT_EXPIRE  ,  you
          must omit the ValidTo parameter.

          Possible values:

          o KEY_MATERIAL_EXPIRES

          o KEY_MATERIAL_DOES_NOT_EXPIRE

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To import key material into a KMS customer master key

       The  following  import-key-material example uploads key material into a
       CMK that was created with no key material. The key  state  of  the  CMK
       must be PendingImport.

       This  command  uses key material that you encrypted with the public key
       that the get-parameters-for-import command returned. It also  uses  the
       import token from the same get-parameters-for-import command.

       The expiration-model parameter indicates that the key material automat-
       ically expires on the date and time specified by the  valid-to  parame-
       ter.  When  the key material expires, AWS KMS deletes the key material,
       the key state of the CMK changes to Pending import and the CMK  becomes
       unusable.  To restore the CMK, you must reimport the same key material.
       To use different key material, you must create a new CMK.

       Before running this command, replace the example key ID  with  a  valid
       key ID or key ARN from your AWS account.

          aws kms import-key-material \
              --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \
              --encrypted-key-material fileb://EncryptedKeyMaterial.bin \
              --import-token fileb://ImportToken.bin \
              --expiration-model KEY_MATERIAL_EXPIRES \
              --valid-to 2021-09-21T19:00:00Z

       This command produces no output.

       Material in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
