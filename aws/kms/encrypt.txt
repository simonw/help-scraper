ENCRYPT()                                                            ENCRYPT()



NAME
       encrypt -

DESCRIPTION
       Encrypts  plaintext of up to 4,096 bytes using a KMS key. You can use a
       symmetric or asymmetric KMS key with a KeyUsage of ENCRYPT_DECRYPT .

       You can use this operation to encrypt small amounts of arbitrary  data,
       such  as a personal identifier or database password, or other sensitive
       information. You don't need to use the Encrypt operation to  encrypt  a
       data  key. The  GenerateDataKey and  GenerateDataKeyPair operations re-
       turn a plaintext data key and an encrypted copy of that data key.

       If you use a symmetric encryption KMS key, you can  use  an  encryption
       context to add additional security to your encryption operation. If you
       specify an EncryptionContext when encrypting data, you must specify the
       same  encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match) when decrypting
       the data. Otherwise, the request to decrypt fails  with  an  InvalidCi-
       phertextException . For more information, see Encryption Context in the
       Key Management Service Developer Guide .

       If you specify an asymmetric KMS key, you must also specify the encryp-
       tion algorithm. The algorithm must be compatible with the KMS key spec.

       WARNING:
          When  you use an asymmetric KMS key to encrypt or reencrypt data, be
          sure to record the KMS key and encryption algorithm that you choose.
          You  will be required to provide the same KMS key and encryption al-
          gorithm when you decrypt the data. If the KMS key and  algorithm  do
          not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation
          fails.

          You are not required to supply the key ID and  encryption  algorithm
          when  you  decrypt  with  symmetric  encryption KMS keys because KMS
          stores this information in the ciphertext  blob.  KMS  cannot  store
          metadata  in ciphertext generated with asymmetric keys. The standard
          format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not  include  configurable
          fields.

       The  maximum size of the data that you can encrypt varies with the type
       of KMS key and the encryption algorithm that you choose.

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          Identifies  the  KMS key to use in the encryption operation. The KMS
          key must have a KeyUsage of ENCRYPT_DECRYPT . To find  the  KeyUsage
          of a KMS key, use the  DescribeKey operation.

          To  specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias
          ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with "alias/" . To  specify
          a  KMS  key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you must use
          the key ARN or alias ARN.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Alias name: alias/ExampleAlias

          o Alias ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias

          To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys  or   De-
          scribeKey . To get the alias name and alias ARN, use  ListAliases .

       --plaintext (blob)
          Data to be encrypted.

       --encryption-context (map)
          Specifies  the  encryption  context that will be used to encrypt the
          data. An encryption context is valid only for  cryptographic  opera-
          tions  with  a symmetric encryption KMS key. The standard asymmetric
          encryption algorithms and HMAC algorithms that KMS uses do not  sup-
          port an encryption context.

          WARNING:
              Do  not  include  confidential  or sensitive information in this
              field. This field may be displayed in  plaintext  in  CloudTrail
              logs and other output.

          An  encryption context is a collection of non-secret key-value pairs
          that represent additional authenticated data. When you  use  an  en-
          cryption  context to encrypt data, you must specify the same (an ex-
          act case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data. An
          encryption  context  is  supported only on operations with symmetric
          encryption KMS keys. On operations  with  symmetric  encryption  KMS
          keys,  an  encryption context is optional, but it is strongly recom-
          mended.

          For more information, see Encryption context in the  Key  Management
          Service Developer Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --grant-tokens (list)
          A list of grant tokens.

          Use  a grant token when your permission to call this operation comes
          from a new grant that has not yet achieved  eventual  consistency  .
          For more information, see Grant token and Using a grant token in the
          Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --encryption-algorithm (string)
          Specifies the encryption algorithm that KMS will use to encrypt  the
          plaintext message. The algorithm must be compatible with the KMS key
          that you specify.

          This parameter is required only for asymmetric KMS keys. The default
          value,  SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT  , is the algorithm used for symmetric en-
          cryption KMS keys. If you are using an asymmetric KMS key, we recom-
          mend RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256.

          The SM2PKE algorithm is only available in China Regions.

          Possible values:

          o SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT

          o RSAES_OAEP_SHA_1

          o RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256

          o SM2PKE

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  if  your request will succeed. DryRun is an optional parame-
          ter.

          To learn more about how to use this parameter, see Testing your  KMS
          API calls in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To encrypt the contents of a file on Linux or MacOS

       The following encrypt command demonstrates the recommended way  to  en-
       crypt data with the AWS CLI.

          aws kms encrypt \
              --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \
              --plaintext fileb://ExamplePlaintextFile \
              --output text \
              --query CiphertextBlob | base64 \
              --decode > ExampleEncryptedFile

       The command does several things:

       1. Uses the --plaintext parameter to indicate the data to encrypt. This
          parameter value must be base64-encoded.
             The value of the plaintext parameter must be  base64-encoded,  or
             you must use the fileb:// prefix, which tells the AWS CLI to read
             binary data from the file.

             If the file is not in the current directory, type the  full  path
             to  file.  For  example: fileb:///var/tmp/ExamplePlaintextFile or
             fileb://C:\Temp\ExamplePlaintextFile. For more information  about
             reading AWS CLI parameter values from a file, see Loading Parame-
             ters from a File in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide and
             Best  Practices for Local File Parameters on the AWS Command Line
             Tool Blog.

       2. Uses the --output and --query parameters to  control  the  command's
          output.
             These  parameters  extract the encrypted data, called the cipher-
             text, from the command's output.

             For more information about controlling  output,  see  Controlling
             Command Output in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

       3. Uses  the  base64 utility to decode the extracted output into binary
          data.
             The ciphertext that is returned by a successful  encrypt  command
             is  base64-encoded text. You must decode this text before you can
             use the AWS CLI to decrypt it.

       4. Saves the binary ciphertext to a file.
             The final part of the command (> ExampleEncryptedFile) saves  the
             binary ciphertext to a file to make decryption easier. For an ex-
             ample command that uses the AWS CLI  to  decrypt  data,  see  the
             decrypt examples.

       Example 2: Using the AWS CLI to encrypt data on Windows

       This  example  is the same as the previous one, except that it uses the
       certutil tool instead of base64. This procedure requires two  commands,
       as shown in the following example.

          aws kms encrypt \
              --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \
              --plaintext fileb://ExamplePlaintextFile \
              --output text \
              --query CiphertextBlob > C:\Temp\ExampleEncryptedFile.base64

          certutil -decode C:\Temp\ExampleEncryptedFile.base64 C:\Temp\ExampleEncryptedFile

       Example 3: Encrypting with an asymmetric KMS key

       The  following  encrypt  command shows how to encrypt plaintext with an
       asymmetric KMS key. The --encryption-algorithm parameter  is  required.
       As  in  all  encrypt  CLI  commands,  the  plaintext  parameter must be
       base64-encoded, or you must use the fileb:// prefix,  which  tells  the
       AWS CLI to read binary data from the file.

          aws kms encrypt \
              --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \
              --encryption-algorithm RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256 \
              --plaintext fileb://ExamplePlaintextFile \
              --output text \
              --query CiphertextBlob | base64 \
              --decode > ExampleEncryptedFile

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       CiphertextBlob -> (blob)
          The encrypted plaintext. When you use the HTTP API or the Amazon Web
          Services CLI, the value is  Base64-encoded.  Otherwise,  it  is  not
          Base64-encoded.

       KeyId -> (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (key ARN ) of the KMS key that was used to
          encrypt the plaintext.

       EncryptionAlgorithm -> (string)
          The encryption algorithm that was used to encrypt the plaintext.
