LIST-RETIRABLE-GRANTS()                                LIST-RETIRABLE-GRANTS()



NAME
       list-retirable-grants -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about all grants in the Amazon Web Services account
       and Region that have the specified retiring principal.

       You can specify any principal in your Amazon Web Services account.  The
       grants that are returned include grants for KMS keys in your Amazon Web
       Services account and other Amazon Web Services accounts. You might  use
       this  operation  to  determine which grants you may retire. To retire a
       grant, use the  RetireGrant operation.

       For detailed information about grants, including grant terminology, see
       Grants  in  KMS in the * Key Management Service Developer Guide * . For
       examples of working with grants in several programming  languages,  see
       Programming grants .
          Cross-account  use : You must specify a principal in your Amazon Web
          Services account. However, this operation can return grants  in  any
          Amazon Web Services account. You do not need kms:ListRetirableGrants
          permission (or any other additional permission) in  any  Amazon  Web
          Services account other than your own.

          Required  permissions : kms:ListRetirableGrants (IAM policy) in your
          Amazon Web Services account.

SYNOPSIS
            list-retirable-grants
          [--limit <value>]
          [--marker <value>]
          --retiring-principal <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --limit (integer)
          Use this parameter to specify the maximum number of items to return.
          When this value is present, KMS does not return more than the speci-
          fied number of items, but it might return fewer.

          This value is optional. If you include a value, it must be between 1
          and  100,  inclusive.  If you do not include a value, it defaults to
          50.

       --marker (string)
          Use this parameter in a subsequent request after you receive  a  re-
          sponse  with  truncated  results.  Set it to the value of NextMarker
          from the truncated response you just received.

       --retiring-principal (string)
          The retiring principal for which to list grants. Enter  a  principal
          in your Amazon Web Services account.

          To  specify  the  retiring  principal,  use the Amazon Resource Name
          (ARN) of an Amazon Web Services principal. Valid Amazon Web Services
          principals  include  Amazon Web Services accounts (root), IAM users,
          federated users, and assumed role users. For  examples  of  the  ARN
          syntax  for specifying a principal, see Amazon Web Services Identity
          and Access Management (IAM) in the Example ARNs section of the  Ama-
          zon Web Services General Reference .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view the grants that a principal can retire

       The following list-retirable-grants example displays all of the  grants
       that  the  ExampleAdmin  user  can  retire  on the customer master keys
       (CMKs) in an AWS account and Region. You can use a  command  like  this
       one to view the grants that any account principal can retire on CMKs in
       the AWS account and Region.

       The value of the required retiring-principal parameter must be the Ama-
       zon Resource Name (ARN) of an account, user, or role.

       You  cannot  specify  a  service for the value of retiring-principal in
       this command, even though a service can be the retiring  principal.  To
       find  the  grants in which a particular service is the retiring princi-
       pal, use the list-grants command.

       The output shows that ExampleAdmin user has permission to retire grants
       on two different CMKs in the account and region. In addition to the re-
       tiring principal, the account (root) has permission to retire any grant
       in the account.

OUTPUT
       Grants -> (list)
          A list of grants.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a grant.

              KeyId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the KMS key to which the grant  ap-
                 plies.

              GrantId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the grant.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  friendly  name  that identifies the grant. If a name was
                 provided in the  CreateGrant request, that name is  returned.
                 Otherwise this value is null.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the grant was created.

              GranteePrincipal -> (string)
                 The identity that gets the permissions in the grant.

                 The GranteePrincipal field in the ListGrants response usually
                 contains the user or role designated as the grantee principal
                 in  the  grant.  However,  when  the grantee principal in the
                 grant is an Amazon Web Services service, the GranteePrincipal
                 field  contains the service principal , which might represent
                 several different grantee principals.

              RetiringPrincipal -> (string)
                 The principal that can retire the grant.

              IssuingAccount -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account under which the grant was is-
                 sued.

              Operations -> (list)
                 The list of operations permitted by the grant.

                 (string)

              Constraints -> (structure)
                 A list of key-value pairs that must be present in the encryp-
                 tion context of certain subsequent operations that the  grant
                 allows.

                 EncryptionContextSubset -> (map)
                     A  list  of  key-value pairs that must be included in the
                     encryption context of  the  cryptographic  operation  re-
                     quest.  The grant allows the cryptographic operation only
                     when the encryption context in the request  includes  the
                     key-value pairs specified in this constraint, although it
                     can include additional key-value pairs.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 EncryptionContextEquals -> (map)
                     A list of key-value pairs that must match the  encryption
                     context in the cryptographic operation request. The grant
                     allows the operation only when the encryption context  in
                     the  request is the same as the encryption context speci-
                     fied in this constraint.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

       NextMarker -> (string)
          When Truncated is true, this element is  present  and  contains  the
          value to use for the Marker parameter in a subsequent request.

       Truncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more items in the list. When
          this value is true, the list in this response is truncated.  To  get
          more items, pass the value of the NextMarker element in thisresponse
          to the Marker parameter in a subsequent request.
