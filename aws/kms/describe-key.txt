DESCRIBE-KEY()                                                  DESCRIBE-KEY()



NAME
       describe-key -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  detailed information about a KMS key. You can run DescribeKey
       on a customer managed key or an Amazon Web Services managed key .

       This detailed information includes the  key  ARN,  creation  date  (and
       deletion  date, if applicable), the key state, and the origin and expi-
       ration date (if any) of the key  material.  It  includes  fields,  like
       KeySpec , that help you distinguish symmetric from asymmetric KMS keys.
       It also provides information that is particularly important to asymmet-
       ric keys, such as the key usage (encryption or signing) and the encryp-
       tion algorithms or signing algorithms that the KMS  key  supports.  For
       KMS keys in custom key stores, it includes information about the custom
       key store, such as the key store ID and the CloudHSM  cluster  ID.  For
       multi-Region  keys, it displays the primary key and all related replica
       keys.
          DescribeKey does not return the following information:

       o Aliases associated with the KMS key. To  get  this  information,  use
         ListAliases .

       o Whether automatic key rotation is enabled on the KMS key. To get this
         information, use  GetKeyRotationStatus . Also, some key  states  pre-
         vent a KMS key from being automatically rotated. For details, see How
         Automatic Key Rotation Works  in  Key  Management  Service  Developer
         Guide .

       o Tags on the KMS key. To get this information, use  ListResourceTags .

       o Key  policies and grants on the KMS key. To get this information, use
         GetKeyPolicy and  ListGrants .

       If you call the DescribeKey operation on a predefined Amazon  Web  Ser-
       vices alias , that is, an Amazon Web Services alias with no key ID, KMS
       creates an Amazon Web Services managed key . Then,  it  associates  the
       alias  with  the  new KMS key, and returns the KeyId and Arn of the new
       KMS key in the response.
          Cross-account use : Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key in
          a  different  Amazon  Web  Services  account, specify the key ARN or
          alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.

          Required permissions : kms:DescribeKey (key policy)

SYNOPSIS
            describe-key
          --key-id <value>
          [--grant-tokens <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          Describes the specified KMS key.

          If you specify a predefined Amazon Web Services alias (an Amazon Web
          Services  alias  with  no  key ID), KMS associates the alias with an
          Amazon Web Services managed key and returns its KeyId and Arn in the
          response.

          To  specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias
          ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with "alias/" . To  specify
          a  KMS  key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you must use
          the key ARN or alias ARN.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Alias name: alias/ExampleAlias

          o Alias ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias

          To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys  or   De-
          scribeKey . To get the alias name and alias ARN, use  ListAliases .

       --grant-tokens (list)
          A list of grant tokens.

          Use  a grant token when your permission to call this operation comes
          from a new grant that has not yet achieved  eventual  consistency  .
          For more information, see Grant token and Using a grant token in the
          Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To find detailed information about a customer master key (CMK)

       The  following describe-key example gets detailed information about the
       AWS managed CMK for Amazon S3 in the example account  and  Region.  You
       can  use  this  command to find details about AWS managed CMKs and cus-
       tomer managed CMKs.

       To specify the CMK, use the key-id  parameter.  This  example  uses  an
       alias  name  value,  but  you can use a key ID, key ARN, alias name, or
       alias ARN in this command.

          aws kms describe-key \
              --key-id alias/aws/s3

       Output:

OUTPUT
       KeyMetadata -> (structure)
          Metadata associated with the key.

          AWSAccountId -> (string)
              The  twelve-digit  account ID of the Amazon Web Services account
              that owns the KMS key.

          KeyId -> (string)
              The globally unique identifier for the KMS key.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key. For examples, see
              Key  Management Service (KMS) in the Example ARNs section of the
              Amazon Web Services General Reference .

          CreationDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the KMS key was created.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the KMS key is enabled. When KeyState  is  En-
              abled this value is true, otherwise it is false.

          Description -> (string)
              The description of the KMS key.

          KeyUsage -> (string)
              The cryptographic operations for which you can use the KMS key.

          KeyState -> (string)
              The current status of the KMS key.

              For  more  information  about how key state affects the use of a
              KMS key, see Key state: Effect on your KMS key in the  Key  Man-
              agement Service Developer Guide .

          DeletionDate -> (timestamp)
              The  date  and  time  after which KMS deletes this KMS key. This
              value is present only when the KMS key is  scheduled  for  dele-
              tion, that is, when its KeyState is PendingDeletion .

              When  the  primary  key  in  a multi-Region key is scheduled for
              deletion but still has replica keys, its key  state  is  Pendin-
              gReplicaDeletion  and  the  length of its waiting period is dis-
              played in the PendingDeletionWindowInDays field.

          ValidTo -> (timestamp)
              The time at which the imported key material  expires.  When  the
              key  material  expires, KMS deletes the key material and the KMS
              key becomes unusable. This value is present only  for  KMS  keys
              whose  Origin is EXTERNAL and whose ExpirationModel is KEY_MATE-
              RIAL_EXPIRES , otherwise this value is omitted.

          Origin -> (string)
              The source of the key material for the KMS key. When this  value
              is  AWS_KMS  ,  KMS created the key material. When this value is
              EXTERNAL , the key material was imported or the KMS key  doesn't
              have any key material. When this value is AWS_CLOUDHSM , the key
              material was created in the CloudHSM cluster associated  with  a
              custom key store.

          CustomKeyStoreId -> (string)
              A  unique  identifier for the custom key store that contains the
              KMS key. This value is present only when the KMS key is  created
              in a custom key store.

          CloudHsmClusterId -> (string)
              The cluster ID of the CloudHSM cluster that contains the key ma-
              terial for the KMS key. When you create a KMS key  in  a  custom
              key  store , KMS creates the key material for the KMS key in the
              associated CloudHSM cluster. This value is present only when the
              KMS key is created in a custom key store.

          ExpirationModel -> (string)
              Specifies whether the KMS key's key material expires. This value
              is present only when Origin is EXTERNAL , otherwise  this  value
              is omitted.

          KeyManager -> (string)
              The manager of the KMS key. KMS keys in your Amazon Web Services
              account are either customer managed or Amazon Web Services  man-
              aged. For more information about the difference, see KMS keys in
              the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          CustomerMasterKeySpec -> (string)
              Instead, use the KeySpec field.

              The KeySpec  and  CustomerMasterKeySpec  fields  have  the  same
              value. We recommend that you use the KeySpec field in your code.
              However, to  avoid  breaking  changes,  KMS  will  support  both
              fields.

          KeySpec -> (string)
              Describes the type of key material in the KMS key.

          EncryptionAlgorithms -> (list)
              The  encryption algorithms that the KMS key supports. You cannot
              use the KMS key with other encryption algorithms within KMS.

              This value is present only when the KeyUsage of the KMS  key  is
              ENCRYPT_DECRYPT .

              (string)

          SigningAlgorithms -> (list)
              The signing algorithms that the KMS key supports. You cannot use
              the KMS key with other signing algorithms within KMS.

              This field appears only when the KeyUsage  of  the  KMS  key  is
              SIGN_VERIFY .

              (string)

          MultiRegion -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether  the KMS key is a multi-Region (True ) or re-
              gional (False ) key. This value is True for multi-Region primary
              and replica keys and False for regional KMS keys.

              For   more   information  about  multi-Region  keys,  see  Using
              multi-Region keys in the Key Management Service Developer  Guide
              .

          MultiRegionConfiguration -> (structure)
              Lists  the  primary  and  replica keys in same multi-Region key.
              This field is present only when the  value  of  the  MultiRegion
              field is True .

              For  more  information  about  any  listed KMS key, use the  De-
              scribeKey operation.

              o MultiRegionKeyType indicates whether the KMS key is a  PRIMARY
                or REPLICA key.

              o PrimaryKey displays the key ARN and Region of the primary key.
                This field displays the current KMS key if it is  the  primary
                key.

              o ReplicaKeys  displays  the key ARNs and Regions of all replica
                keys. This field includes the current  KMS  key  if  it  is  a
                replica key.

              MultiRegionKeyType -> (string)
                 Indicates whether the KMS key is a PRIMARY or REPLICA key.

              PrimaryKey -> (structure)
                 Displays  the  key  ARN  and  Region of the primary key. This
                 field includes the current KMS key if it is the primary key.

                 Arn -> (string)
                     Displays the key ARN of a primary or  replica  key  of  a
                     multi-Region key.

                 Region -> (string)
                     Displays  the  Amazon Web Services Region of a primary or
                     replica key in a multi-Region key.

              ReplicaKeys -> (list)
                 displays the key ARNs and Regions of all replica  keys.  This
                 field includes the current KMS key if it is a replica key.

                 (structure)
                     Describes  the  primary  or replica key in a multi-Region
                     key.

                     Arn -> (string)
                        Displays the key ARN of a primary or replica key of  a
                        multi-Region key.

                     Region -> (string)
                        Displays  the  Amazon Web Services Region of a primary
                        or replica key in a multi-Region key.

          PendingDeletionWindowInDays -> (integer)
              The waiting period before the primary key in a multi-Region  key
              is  deleted.  This  waiting  period  begins when the last of its
              replica keys is deleted. This value is  present  only  when  the
              KeyState  of  the KMS key is PendingReplicaDeletion . That indi-
              cates that the KMS key is the primary key in a multi-Region key,
              it  is scheduled for deletion, and it still has existing replica
              keys.

              When a single-Region KMS key or a multi-Region  replica  key  is
              scheduled  for  deletion,  its deletion date is displayed in the
              DeletionDate field. However, when the primary key in a multi-Re-
              gion  key  is scheduled for deletion, its waiting period doesn't
              begin until all of its replica keys are deleted. This value dis-
              plays  that  waiting  period.  When  the last replica key in the
              multi-Region key is deleted, the KeyState of the scheduled  pri-
              mary  key changes from PendingReplicaDeletion to PendingDeletion
              and the deletion date appears in the DeletionDate field.
