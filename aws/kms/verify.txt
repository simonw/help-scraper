NAME
       verify -

DESCRIPTION
       Verifies a digital signature that was generated by the  Sign operation.

       Verification  confirms  that an authorized user signed the message with
       the specified KMS key and signing algorithm,  and  the  message  hasn't
       changed since it was signed. If the signature is verified, the value of
       the SignatureValid field in the response is True  .  If  the  signature
       verification fails, the Verify operation fails with an KMSInvalidSigna-
       tureException exception.

       A digital signature is generated by using the private key in  an  asym-
       metric  KMS  key.  The signature is verified by using the public key in
       the same asymmetric KMS key. For information about symmetric and  asym-
       metric KMS keys, see Using Symmetric and Asymmetric KMS keys in the Key
       Management Service Developer Guide .

       To verify a digital signature, you can use the Verify operation.  Spec-
       ify  the  same  asymmetric KMS key, message, and signing algorithm that
       were used to produce the signature.

       You can also verify the digital signature by using the  public  key  of
       the KMS key outside of KMS. Use the  GetPublicKey operation to download
       the public key in the asymmetric KMS key and then use the public key to
       verify  the signature outside of KMS. The advantage of using the Verify
       operation is that it is performed within KMS. As a result, it's easy to
       call, the operation is performed within the FIPS boundary, it is logged
       in CloudTrail, and you can use key policy and IAM policy  to  determine
       who is authorized to use the KMS key to verify signatures.

       The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key
       state. For details, see Key state: Effect on your KMS key  in  the  Key
       Management Service Developer Guide .
          Cross-account use : Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key in
          a different Amazon Web Services account,  specify  the  key  ARN  or
          alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.

SYNOPSIS
            verify
          --key-id <value>
          --message <value>
          [--message-type <value>]
          --signature <value>
          --signing-algorithm <value>
          [--grant-tokens <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          Identifies  the  asymmetric  KMS key that will be used to verify the
          signature. This must be the same KMS key that was used  to  generate
          the  signature.  If  you  specify a different KMS key, the signature
          verification fails.

          To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or  alias
          ARN.  When using an alias name, prefix it with "alias/" . To specify
          a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you  must  use
          the key ARN or alias ARN.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Alias name: alias/ExampleAlias

          o Alias ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias

          To  get  the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys or  De-
          scribeKey . To get the alias name and alias ARN, use  ListAliases .

       --message (blob)
          Specifies the message that was signed. You can submit a raw  message
          of  up to 4096 bytes, or a hash digest of the message. If you submit
          a digest, use the MessageType parameter with a value of DIGEST .

          If the message specified here is different from the message that was
          signed, the signature verification fails. A message and its hash di-
          gest are considered to be the same message.

       --message-type (string)
          Tells KMS whether the value of the Message parameter is a message or
          message  digest. The default value, RAW, indicates a message. To in-
          dicate a message digest, enter DIGEST .

          WARNING:
              Use the DIGEST value only when the value of the Message  parame-
              ter  is a message digest. If you use the DIGEST value with a raw
              message, the security of the verification operation can be  com-
              promised.

          Possible values:

          o RAW

          o DIGEST

       --signature (blob)
          The signature that the Sign operation generated.

       --signing-algorithm (string)
          The signing algorithm that was used to sign the message. If you sub-
          mit a different algorithm, the signature verification fails.

          Possible values:

          o RSASSA_PSS_SHA_256

          o RSASSA_PSS_SHA_384

          o RSASSA_PSS_SHA_512

          o RSASSA_PKCS1_V1_5_SHA_256

          o RSASSA_PKCS1_V1_5_SHA_384

          o RSASSA_PKCS1_V1_5_SHA_512

          o ECDSA_SHA_256

          o ECDSA_SHA_384

          o ECDSA_SHA_512

       --grant-tokens (list)
          A list of grant tokens.

          Use a grant token when your permission to call this operation  comes
          from  a  new  grant that has not yet achieved eventual consistency .
          For more information, see Grant token and Using a grant token in the
          Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To verify a digital signature

       The following verify example verifies a cryptographic signature  for  a
       short message. The key ID, message, message type, and signing algorithm
       must be same ones that were used to sign  the  message.  The  signature
       that you specify cannot be base64-encoded. For help decoding the signa-
       ture that the sign command returns, see the sign command examples.

       The output of the command includes a Boolean SignatureValid field  that
       indicates  that the signature was verified. If the signature validation
       fails, the verify command fails, too.

       Before running this command, replace the example key ID  with  a  valid
       key ID from your AWS account.

          aws kms verify \
              --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \
              --message fileb://originalString \
              --message-type RAW \
              --signing-algorithm RSASSA_PKCS1_V1_5_SHA_256 \
              --signature fileb://ExampleSignature

       Output:

          {
              "KeyId": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab",
              "SignatureValid": true,
              "SigningAlgorithm": "RSASSA_PKCS1_V1_5_SHA_256"
          }

OUTPUT
       KeyId -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (key ARN ) of the asymmetric KMS key that
          was used to verify the signature.

       SignatureValid -> (boolean)
          A Boolean value that indicates whether the signature was verified. A
          value  of  True indicates that the Signature was produced by signing
          the Message with the specified KeyID and  SigningAlgorithm.  If  the
          signature  is not verified, the Verify operation fails with a KMSIn-
          validSignatureException exception.

       SigningAlgorithm -> (string)
          The signing algorithm that was used to verify the signature.
