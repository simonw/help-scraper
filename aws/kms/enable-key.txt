ENABLE-KEY()                                                      ENABLE-KEY()



NAME
       enable-key -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets  the key state of a KMS key to enabled. This allows you to use the
       KMS key for cryptographic operations .

       The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key
       state.  For  details,  see Key state: Effect on your KMS key in the Key
       Management Service Developer Guide .
          Cross-account use : No. You cannot perform this operation on  a  KMS
          key in a different Amazon Web Services account.

          Required permissions : kms:EnableKey (key policy)

          Related operations :  DisableKey

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            enable-key
          --key-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          Identifies the KMS key to enable.

          Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          To  get  the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys or  De-
          scribeKey .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To enable a customer master key (CMK)

       The  following  enable-key  example enables a customer managed customer
       master key (CMK). You can use a command like this one to enable  a  CMK
       that you temporarily disabled by using the disable-key command. You can
       also use it to enable a CMK that is disabled because it  was  scheduled
       for deletion and the deletion was canceled.

       To  specify the CMK, use the key-id parameter. This example uses an key
       ID value, but you can use a key ID or key ARN value in this command.

       Before running this command, replace the example key ID  with  a  valid
       one.

          aws kms enable-key \
              --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

       This command produces no output. To verify that the CMK is enabled, use
       the describe-key command. See the values of the  KeyState  and  Enabled
       fields in the describe-key output.

       For  more  information,  see Enabling and Disabling Keys in the AWS Key
       Management Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
