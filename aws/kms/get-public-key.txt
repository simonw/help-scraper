GET-PUBLIC-KEY()                                              GET-PUBLIC-KEY()



NAME
       get-public-key -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the public key of an asymmetric KMS key. Unlike the private key
       of a asymmetric KMS key, which never leaves  KMS  unencrypted,  callers
       with  kms:GetPublicKey  permission  can  download  the public key of an
       asymmetric KMS key. You can share the public key to allow others to en-
       crypt  messages  and  verify signatures outside of KMS. For information
       about symmetric and asymmetric KMS keys, see Using Symmetric and  Asym-
       metric KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

       You  do  not  need to download the public key. Instead, you can use the
       public key within KMS by calling the  Encrypt ,  ReEncrypt , or  Verify
       operations  with  the identifier of an asymmetric KMS key. When you use
       the public key within KMS, you benefit from the authentication,  autho-
       rization,  and  logging  that are part of every KMS operation. You also
       reduce of risk of encrypting data that cannot be decrypted. These  fea-
       tures  are  not effective outside of KMS. For details, see Special Con-
       siderations for Downloading Public Keys .

       To help you use the public key safely outside of KMS, GetPublicKey  re-
       turns  important  information about the public key in the response, in-
       cluding:

       o KeySpec : The type of  key  material  in  the  public  key,  such  as
         RSA_4096 or ECC_NIST_P521 .

       o KeyUsage : Whether the key is used for encryption or signing.

       o EncryptionAlgorithms  or SigningAlgorithms : A list of the encryption
         algorithms or the signing algorithms for the key.

       Although KMS cannot enforce these restrictions on external  operations,
       it  is  crucial that you use this information to prevent the public key
       from being used improperly. For example, you can prevent a public sign-
       ing  key from being used encrypt data, or prevent a public key from be-
       ing used with an encryption algorithm that is not supported by KMS. You
       can  also  avoid errors, such as using the wrong signing algorithm in a
       verification operation.

       The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key
       state.  For  details,  see Key state: Effect on your KMS key in the Key
       Management Service Developer Guide .
          Cross-account use : Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key in
          a  different  Amazon  Web  Services  account, specify the key ARN or
          alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.

          Required permissions : kms:GetPublicKey (key policy)

SYNOPSIS
            get-public-key
          --key-id <value>
          [--grant-tokens <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          Identifies the asymmetric KMS key that includes the public key.

          To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or  alias
          ARN.  When using an alias name, prefix it with "alias/" . To specify
          a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you  must  use
          the key ARN or alias ARN.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Alias name: alias/ExampleAlias

          o Alias ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias

          To  get  the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys or  De-
          scribeKey . To get the alias name and alias ARN, use  ListAliases .

       --grant-tokens (list)
          A list of grant tokens.

          Use a grant token when your permission to call this operation  comes
          from  a  new  grant that has not yet achieved eventual consistency .
          For more information, see Grant token and Using a grant token in the
          Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To download the public key of an asymmetric CMK

       The  following  get-public-key  example  downloads the public key of an
       asymmetric CMK.

       In addition to returning the public key, the output  includes  informa-
       tion that you need to use the public key safely outside of AWS KMS, in-
       cluding the key usage and supported encryption algorithms.

       Before running this command, replace the example key ID  with  a  valid
       key ID from your AWS account.

          aws kms get-public-key \
              --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

       Output:

          {
              "KeyId": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab",
              "PublicKey": "jANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAg8AMIICCgKCAgEAl5epvg1/QtJhxSi2g9SDEVg8QV/...",
              "CustomerMasterKeySpec": "RSA_4096",
              "KeyUsage": "ENCRYPT_DECRYPT",
              "EncryptionAlgorithms": [
                  "RSAES_OAEP_SHA_1",
                  "RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256"
              ]
          }

       For  more information about using asymmetric CMKs in AWS KMS, see Using
       Symmetric and Asymmetric Keys in the AWS  Key  Management  Service  API
       Reference.

       Example 2: To convert a public key to DER format (Linux and macOS)

       The  following  get-public-key  example  downloads the public key of an
       asymmetric CMK and saves it in a DER file.

       When you use the get-public-key command in the AWS CLI,  it  returns  a
       DER-encoded  X.509 public key that is Base64-encoded. This example gets
       the value of the PublicKey property as text. It Base64-decodes the Pub-
       licKey  and  saves  it in the public_key.der file. The output parameter
       returns the output as text, instead of JSON. The --query parameter gets
       only  the  PublicKey  property, not the properties that you need to use
       the public key safely outside of AWS KMS.

       Before running this command, replace the example key ID  with  a  valid
       key ID from your AWS account.

          aws kms get-public-key \
              --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \
              --output text \
              --query PublicKey | base64 --decode > public_key.der

       This command produces no output.

       Symmetric and Asymmetric Keys in the AWS  Key  Management  Service  API
       Reference.

OUTPUT
       KeyId -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (key ARN ) of the asymmetric KMS key from
          which the public key was downloaded.

       PublicKey -> (blob)
          The exported public key.

          The value is a DER-encoded X.509 public key, also known as  Subject-
          PublicKeyInfo (SPKI), as defined in RFC 5280 . When you use the HTTP
          API or the Amazon Web Services CLI,  the  value  is  Base64-encoded.
          Otherwise, it is not Base64-encoded.

       CustomerMasterKeySpec -> (string)
          Instead, use the KeySpec field in the GetPublicKey response.

          The KeySpec and CustomerMasterKeySpec fields have the same value. We
          recommend that you use the KeySpec field in your code.  However,  to
          avoid breaking changes, KMS will support both fields.

       KeySpec -> (string)
          The type of the of the public key that was downloaded.

       KeyUsage -> (string)
          The  permitted  use  of the public key. Valid values are ENCRYPT_DE-
          CRYPT or SIGN_VERIFY .

          This information is critical. If a public key with  SIGN_VERIFY  key
          usage  encrypts  data  outside  of KMS, the ciphertext cannot be de-
          crypted.

       EncryptionAlgorithms -> (list)
          The encryption algorithms that KMS supports for this key.

          This information is critical. If a public key encrypts data  outside
          of  KMS by using an unsupported encryption algorithm, the ciphertext
          cannot be decrypted.

          This field appears in the response only when  the  KeyUsage  of  the
          public key is ENCRYPT_DECRYPT .

          (string)

       SigningAlgorithms -> (list)
          The signing algorithms that KMS supports for this key.

          This  field  appears  in  the response only when the KeyUsage of the
          public key is SIGN_VERIFY .

          (string)
