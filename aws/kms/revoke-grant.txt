REVOKE-GRANT()                                                  REVOKE-GRANT()



NAME
       revoke-grant -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  specified grant. You revoke a grant to terminate the per-
       missions that the grant allows. For more information, see Retiring  and
       revoking grants in the * Key Management Service Developer Guide * .

       When  you create, retire, or revoke a grant, there might be a brief de-
       lay, usually less than five  minutes,  until  the  grant  is  available
       throughout  KMS.  This state is known as eventual consistency . For de-
       tails, see Eventual consistency in the * Key Management Service  Devel-
       oper Guide * .

       For detailed information about grants, including grant terminology, see
       Grants in KMS in the * Key Management Service Developer Guide *  .  For
       examples  of  working with grants in several programming languages, see
       Programming grants .
          Cross-account use : Yes. To perform this operation on a KMS key in a
          different  Amazon  Web  Services account, specify the key ARN in the
          value of the KeyId parameter.

          Required permissions : kms:RevokeGrant (key policy).

SYNOPSIS
            revoke-grant
          --key-id <value>
          --grant-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the KMS key associated with  the  grant.  To
          get  the  key  ID  and  key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys or  De-
          scribeKey .

          Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key. To specify a  KMS  key
          in  a  different  Amazon  Web Services account, you must use the key
          ARN.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys  or   De-
          scribeKey .

       --grant-id (string)
          Identifies  the  grant  to revoke. To get the grant ID, use  Create-
          Grant ,  ListGrants , or  ListRetirableGrants .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To revoke a grant on a customer master key

       The following revoke-grant example deletes a grant from a CMK. The fol-
       lowing example command specifies the grant-id and  the  key-id  parame-
       ters. The value of the key-id parameter can be the key ID or the Amazon
       Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK.

          aws kms revoke-grant \
              --grant-id 1234a2345b8a4e350500d432bccf8ecd6506710e1391880c4f7f7140160c9af3 \
              --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

       This command produces no output. To confirm that the grant was revoked,
       use the list-grants command.

       vice Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
