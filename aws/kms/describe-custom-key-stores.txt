DESCRIBE-CUSTOM-KEY-STORES()                      DESCRIBE-CUSTOM-KEY-STORES()



NAME
       describe-custom-key-stores -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about custom key stores in the account and Region.

       This  operation is part of the Custom Key Store feature feature in KMS,
       which combines the convenience and extensive integration  of  KMS  with
       the isolation and control of a single-tenant key store.

       By  default,  this  operation  returns information about all custom key
       stores in the account and Region. To get only information about a  par-
       ticular  custom  key  store,  use either the CustomKeyStoreName or Cus-
       tomKeyStoreId parameter (but not both).

       To determine whether the custom key store is connected to its  CloudHSM
       cluster, use the ConnectionState element in the response. If an attempt
       to connect the custom key store failed, the  ConnectionState  value  is
       FAILED  and  the  ConnectionErrorCode element in the response indicates
       the cause of the failure. For help interpreting the ConnectionErrorCode
       , see  CustomKeyStoresListEntry .

       Custom key stores have a DISCONNECTED connection state if the key store
       has never been connected or you use the  DisconnectCustomKeyStore oper-
       ation to disconnect it. If your custom key store state is CONNECTED but
       you are having trouble using it, make sure that its associated CloudHSM
       cluster  is active and contains the minimum number of HSMs required for
       the operation, if any.

       For help repairing your custom key store, see the Troubleshooting  Cus-
       tom Key Stores topic in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .
          Cross-account  use : No. You cannot perform this operation on a cus-
          tom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-custom-key-stores
          [--custom-key-store-id <value>]
          [--custom-key-store-name <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--marker <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --custom-key-store-id (string)
          Gets only information about the specified custom  key  store.  Enter
          the key store ID.

          By  default,  this  operation  gets information about all custom key
          stores in the account and Region. To limit the output to a  particu-
          lar  custom  key  store,  you can use either the CustomKeyStoreId or
          CustomKeyStoreName parameter, but not both.

       --custom-key-store-name (string)
          Gets only information about the specified custom  key  store.  Enter
          the friendly name of the custom key store.

          By  default,  this  operation  gets information about all custom key
          stores in the account and Region. To limit the output to a  particu-
          lar  custom  key  store,  you can use either the CustomKeyStoreId or
          CustomKeyStoreName parameter, but not both.

       --limit (integer)
          Use this parameter to specify the maximum number of items to return.
          When this value is present, KMS does not return more than the speci-
          fied number of items, but it might return fewer.

       --marker (string)
          Use this parameter in a subsequent request after you receive  a  re-
          sponse  with  truncated  results.  Set it to the value of NextMarker
          from the truncated response you just received.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get details about a custom key store

       The following describe-custom-key-store example  displays  details  for
       the specified custom key store. You can use this command to get details
       about a particular custom key store or all custom key stores in an  AWS
       account and Region.

       To  identify  a particular custom key store, this example uses the cus-
       tom-key-store-name parameter with the key store name.  If  you  prefer,
       you can use the custom-key-store-id parameter with the key store ID. To
       get all custom key stores in the account and Region, omit  all  parame-
       ters.

          aws kms describe-custom-key-stores \
              --custom-key-store-name ExampleKeyStore

       The output of this command includes useful details about the custom key
       store including its connection state (ConnectionState). If the  connec-
       tion  state  is FAILED, the output includes a ConnectionErrorCode field
       that describes the problem.

              "CustomKeyStores": [
                  {
                      "CloudHsmClusterId": "cluster-1a23b4cdefg",
                      "ConnectionState": "CONNECTED",
                      "CreationDate": "1.599288695918E9",
                      "CustomKeyStoreId": "cks-1234567890abcdef0",
                      "CustomKeyStoreName": "ExampleKeyStore",
                      "TrustAnchorCertificate": "<certificate appears here>"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       CustomKeyStores -> (list)
          Contains metadata about each custom key store.

          (structure)
              Contains  information  about each custom key store in the custom
              key store list.

              CustomKeyStoreId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the custom key store.

              CustomKeyStoreName -> (string)
                 The user-specified friendly name for the custom key store.

              CloudHsmClusterId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the CloudHSM cluster that is  associ-
                 ated with the custom key store.

              TrustAnchorCertificate -> (string)
                 The trust anchor certificate of the associated CloudHSM clus-
                 ter. When you initialize the cluster , you create  this  cer-
                 tificate and save it in the customerCA.crt file.

              ConnectionState -> (string)
                 Indicates  whether  the  custom key store is connected to its
                 CloudHSM cluster.

                 You can create and use KMS keys in  your  custom  key  stores
                 only when its connection state is CONNECTED .

                 The  value  is  DISCONNECTED  if the key store has never been
                 connected or you use the  DisconnectCustomKeyStore  operation
                 to  disconnect it. If the value is CONNECTED but you are hav-
                 ing trouble using the custom key store, make  sure  that  its
                 associated  CloudHSM  cluster is active and contains at least
                 one active HSM.

                 A value of FAILED indicates that an attempt  to  connect  was
                 unsuccessful.  The  ConnectionErrorCode field in the response
                 indicates the cause of the failure. For help resolving a con-
                 nection  failure,  see  Troubleshooting a Custom Key Store in
                 the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

              ConnectionErrorCode -> (string)
                 Describes the connection error. This field appears in the re-
                 sponse only when the ConnectionState is FAILED . For help re-
                 solving these errors, see How to Fix a Connection Failure  in
                 Key Management Service Developer Guide .

                 Valid values are:

                 o CLUSTER_NOT_FOUND  -  KMS  cannot find the CloudHSM cluster
                   with the specified cluster ID.

                 o INSUFFICIENT_CLOUDHSM_HSMS - The associated CloudHSM  clus-
                   ter  does  not contain any active HSMs. To connect a custom
                   key store to its CloudHSM cluster, the cluster must contain
                   at least one active HSM.

                 o INTERNAL_ERROR  - KMS could not complete the request due to
                   an internal error. Retry the request. For ConnectCustomKey-
                   Store requests, disconnect the custom key store before try-
                   ing to connect again.

                 o INVALID_CREDENTIALS - KMS does not have the  correct  pass-
                   word  for  the kmsuser crypto user in the CloudHSM cluster.
                   Before you  can  connect  your  custom  key  store  to  its
                   CloudHSM cluster, you must change the kmsuser account pass-
                   word and update the key store password value for the custom
                   key store.

                 o NETWORK_ERRORS  -  Network  errors  are preventing KMS from
                   connecting to the custom key store.

                 o SUBNET_NOT_FOUND - A subnet in the CloudHSM cluster config-
                   uration  was deleted. If KMS cannot find all of the subnets
                   in the cluster configuration, attempts to connect the  cus-
                   tom key store to the CloudHSM cluster fail. To fix this er-
                   ror, create a cluster from a recent backup and associate it
                   with  your  custom  key  store. (This process creates a new
                   cluster configuration with a VPC and private subnets.)  For
                   details,  see  How  to  Fix a Connection Failure in the Key
                   Management Service Developer Guide .

                 o USER_LOCKED_OUT - The kmsuser CU account is locked  out  of
                   the  associated  CloudHSM  cluster  due  to too many failed
                   password attempts. Before you can connect your  custom  key
                   store  to its CloudHSM cluster, you must change the kmsuser
                   account password and update the key  store  password  value
                   for the custom key store.

                 o USER_LOGGED_IN  - The kmsuser CU account is logged into the
                   the associated CloudHSM cluster. This prevents KMS from ro-
                   tating  the  kmsuser  account password and logging into the
                   cluster. Before you can connect your custom  key  store  to
                   its  CloudHSM  cluster,  you must log the kmsuser CU out of
                   the cluster. If you changed the  kmsuser  password  to  log
                   into  the  cluster,  you must also and update the key store
                   password value for the custom key store. For help, see  How
                   to  Log Out and Reconnect in the Key Management Service De-
                   veloper Guide .

                 o USER_NOT_FOUND - KMS cannot find a kmsuser  CU  account  in
                   the  associated  CloudHSM  cluster.  Before you can connect
                   your custom key store to its  CloudHSM  cluster,  you  must
                   create a kmsuser CU account in the cluster, and then update
                   the key store password value for the custom key store.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the custom key store was created.

       NextMarker -> (string)
          When Truncated is true, this element is  present  and  contains  the
          value to use for the Marker parameter in a subsequent request.

       Truncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more items in the list. When
          this value is true, the list in this response is truncated.  To  get
          more items, pass the value of the NextMarker element in thisresponse
          to the Marker parameter in a subsequent request.
