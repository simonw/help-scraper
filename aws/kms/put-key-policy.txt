DESCRIPTION
       Attaches a key policy to the specified KMS key.

       tity and Access Management User Guide * . For examples of adding a  key
       policy  in  multiple programming languages, see Setting a key policy in

SYNOPSIS
            put-key-policy
          --key-id <value>
          --policy-name <value>
          --policy <value>
          [--bypass-policy-lockout-safety-check | --no-bypass-policy-lockout-safety-check]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          Sets the key policy on the specified KMS key.

          Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          To  get  the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys or  De-
          scribeKey .

       --policy-name (string)
          The name of the key policy. The only valid value is default .

       --policy (string)
          The key policy to attach to the KMS key.

          The key policy must meet the following criteria:

          o If you don't set BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck to true,  the  key
            policy  must  allow  the principal that is making the PutKeyPolicy
            request to make a subsequent PutKeyPolicy request on the KMS  key.
            This  reduces  the risk that the KMS key becomes unmanageable. For
            more information, refer to the scenario in the Default Key  Policy
            section of the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          o Each  statement in the key policy must contain one or more princi-
            pals. The principals in the key policy must exist and  be  visible
            to  KMS.  When you create a new Amazon Web Services principal (for
            example, an IAM user or role), you might need to enforce  a  delay
            before including the new principal in a key policy because the new
            principal might not be immediately visible to KMS. For more infor-
            mation, see Changes that I make are not always immediately visible
            in the Amazon Web Services Identity  and  Access  Management  User
            Guide .

          A key policy document must conform to the following rules.

          o Up to 32 kilobytes (32768 bytes)

          o Must be UTF-8 encoded

          o The  only  Unicode  characters  that are permitted in a key policy
            document are the horizontal tab (U+0009), linefeed (U+000A),  car-
            riage  return  (U+000D),  and  characters  in  the range U+0020 to
            U+00FF.

          o The Sid element in a key  policy  statement  can  include  spaces.
            (Spaces  are  prohibited in the Sid element of an IAM policy docu-
            ment.)

       --bypass-policy-lockout-safety-check     |     --no-bypass-policy-lock-
       out-safety-check (boolean)
          A  flag  to indicate whether to bypass the key policy lockout safety
          check.

          WARNING:
              Setting this value to true increases the risk that the  KMS  key
              becomes  unmanageable. Do not set this value to true indiscrimi-
              nately.

              For more information, refer to the scenario in the  Default  Key
              Policy section in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          Use  this  parameter  only  when you intend to prevent the principal
          that is making the request from making a subsequent PutKeyPolicy re-
          quest on the KMS key.

          The default value is false.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To change the key policy for a KMS key

       The following put-key-policy example changes the key policy for a  cus-
       tomer managed key.

       To begin, create a key policy and save it in a local JSON file. In this
       example, the file is key_policy.json. You can also specify the key pol-
       icy as a string value of the policy parameter.

       The first statement in this key policy gives the AWS account permission
       to use IAM policies to control access to the KMS key. The second state-
       ment  gives  the  test-user user permission to run the describe-key and
       list-keys commands on the KMS key.

       Contents of key_policy.json:

          {
              "Version" : "2012-10-17",
              "Id" : "key-default-1",
              "Statement" : [
                  {
                      "Sid" : "Enable IAM User Permissions",
                      "Effect" : "Allow",
                      "Principal" : {
                          "AWS" : "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"
                      },
                      "Action" : "kms:*",
                      "Resource" : "*"
                  },
                  {
                      "Sid" : "Allow Use of Key",
                      "Effect" : "Allow",
                      "Principal" : {
                          "AWS" : "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/test-user"
                      },
                      "Action" : [
                          "kms:DescribeKey",
                          "kms:ListKeys"
                      ],
                      "Resource" : "*"
                  }
              ]
          }

       To identify the KMS key, this example uses the key ID, but you can also
       usa key ARN. To specify the key policy, the command uses the policy pa-
       rameter. To indicate that the policy is in a file, it uses the required
       file://  prefix.  This prefix is required to identify files on all sup-
       ported operating systems. Finally, the command uses the policy-name pa-
       rameter  with  a  value  of  default.  This parameter is required, even
       though default is the only valid value.

          aws kms put-key-policy \
              --policy-name default \
              --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \
              --policy file://key_policy.json

       This command does not produce any output. To verify  that  the  command
       was  effective,  use  the get-key-policy command. The following example
       command gets the key policy for the same KMS key. The output  parameter
       with a value of text returns a text format that is easy to read.

          aws kms get-key-policy \
              --policy-name default \
              --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \
              --output text

       Output:

          {
              "Version" : "2012-10-17",
              "Id" : "key-default-1",
              "Statement" : [
                  {
                      "Sid" : "Enable IAM User Permissions",
                      "Effect" : "Allow",
                      "Principal" : {
                          "AWS" : "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"
                      },
                      "Action" : "kms:*",
                      "Resource" : "*"
                      },
                      {
                      "Sid" : "Allow Use of Key",
                      "Effect" : "Allow",
                      "Principal" : {
                          "AWS" : "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/test-user"
                      },
                      "Action" : [ "kms:Describe", "kms:List" ],
                      "Resource" : "*"
                  }
              ]
          }
