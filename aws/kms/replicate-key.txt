REPLICATE-KEY()                                                REPLICATE-KEY()



NAME
       replicate-key -

DESCRIPTION
       Replicates a multi-Region key into the specified Region. This operation
       creates a multi-Region replica key based on a multi-Region primary  key
       in  a  different  Region of the same Amazon Web Services partition. You
       can create multiple replicas of a primary key, but each must  be  in  a
       different  Region.  To create a multi-Region primary key, use the  Cre-
       ateKey operation.

       This operation supports multi-Region keys , an KMS  feature  that  lets
       you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web Ser-
       vices Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID,  key  mate-
       rial,  and  other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to encrypt
       data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it  in  a  different
       Amazon  Web  Services Region without re-encrypting the data or making a
       cross-Region call. For more information about  multi-Region  keys,  see
       Using multi-Region keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

       A  replica  key is a fully-functional KMS key that can be used indepen-
       dently of its primary and peer replica keys.  A  primary  key  and  its
       replica  keys  share properties that make them interoperable. They have
       the same key ID and key material. They also have the same  key  spec  ,
       key  usage  , key material origin , and automatic key rotation status .
       KMS automatically synchronizes these shared  properties  among  related
       multi-Region  keys.  All  other properties of a replica key can differ,
       including its key policy , tags , aliases , and key state . KMS pricing
       and quotas for KMS keys apply to each primary key and replica key.

       When  this operation completes, the new replica key has a transient key
       state of Creating . This key state changes to Enabled (or PendingImport
       )  after a few seconds when the process of creating the new replica key
       is complete. While the key state is Creating , you can manage key,  but
       you  cannot yet use it in cryptographic operations. If you are creating
       and using the replica key programmatically, retry on KMSInvalidStateEx-
       ception  or  call  DescribeKey to check its KeyState value before using
       it. For details about the Creating key state, see Key state: Effect  on
       your KMS key in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

       The  CloudTrail  log of a ReplicateKey operation records a ReplicateKey
       operation in the primary key's Region and a  CreateKey operation in the
       replica key's Region.

       If you replicate a multi-Region primary key with imported key material,
       the replica key is created with no key material. You  must  import  the
       same  key material that you imported into the primary key. For details,
       see Importing key material into multi-Region keys in the Key Management
       Service Developer Guide .

       To convert a replica key to a primary key, use the  UpdatePrimaryRegion
       operation.

       NOTE:
              ReplicateKey uses different default values for the KeyPolicy and
              Tags parameters than those used in the KMS console. For details,
              see the parameter descriptions.

          Cross-account use : No. You cannot use this operation  to  create  a
          replica key in a different Amazon Web Services account.

          Required permissions :

       o kms:ReplicateKey  on  the  primary key (in the primary key's Region).
         Include this permission in the primary key's key policy.

       o kms:CreateKey in an IAM policy in the replica Region.

       o To use the Tags parameter, kms:TagResource in an IAM  policy  in  the
         replica Region.

SYNOPSIS
            replicate-key
          --key-id <value>
          --replica-region <value>
          [--policy <value>]
          [--bypass-policy-lockout-safety-check | --no-bypass-policy-lockout-safety-check]
          [--description <value>]

          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          Identifies the multi-Region primary key that is being replicated. To
          determine whether a KMS key is a multi-Region primary key,  use  the
          DescribeKey  operation  to check the value of the MultiRegionKeyType
          property.

          Specify the key ID or key ARN of a multi-Region primary key.

          For example:

          o Key ID: mrk-1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/mrk-1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab

          To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys  or   De-
          scribeKey .

       --replica-region (string)
          The  Region  ID  of  the Amazon Web Services Region for this replica
          key.

          Enter the Region ID, such as us-east-1 or  ap-southeast-2  .  For  a
          list  of  Amazon Web Services Regions in which KMS is supported, see
          KMS service endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

          The replica must be in a different Amazon Web Services  Region  than
          its  primary  key and other replicas of that primary key, but in the
          same Amazon Web Services partition. KMS must  be  available  in  the
          replica  Region. If the Region is not enabled by default, the Amazon
          Web Services account must be enabled in the Region.

          For information about Amazon Web Services partitions, see Amazon Re-
          source Names (ARNs) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference* .
          For information about enabling and disabling Regions, see Enabling a
          Region  and  Disabling  a  Region in the Amazon Web Services General
          Reference .

       --policy (string)
          The key policy to attach to the KMS key. This parameter is optional.
          If  you  do  not  provide a key policy, KMS attaches the default key
          policy to the KMS key.

          The key policy is not a shared property of  multi-Region  keys.  You
          can  specify  the same key policy or a different key policy for each
          key in a set of related multi-Region keys. KMS does not  synchronize
          this property.

          If you provide a key policy, it must meet the following criteria:

          o If  you  don't set BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck to true, the key
            policy must give the caller  kms:PutKeyPolicy  permission  on  the
            replica key. This reduces the risk that the KMS key becomes unman-
            ageable. For more  information,  refer  to  the  scenario  in  the
            Default  Key Policy section of the * Key Management Service Devel-
            oper Guide * .

          o Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more  princi-
            pals.  The  principals in the key policy must exist and be visible
            to KMS. When you create a new Amazon Web Services  principal  (for
            example,  an  IAM user or role), you might need to enforce a delay
            before including the new principal in a key policy because the new
            principal might not be immediately visible to KMS. For more infor-
            mation, see Changes that I make are not always immediately visible
            in the * Identity and Access Management User Guide * .

          o The key policy size quota is 32 kilobytes (32768 bytes).

       --bypass-policy-lockout-safety-check     |     --no-bypass-policy-lock-
       out-safety-check (boolean)
          A flag to indicate whether to bypass the key policy  lockout  safety
          check.

          WARNING:
              Setting  this  value to true increases the risk that the KMS key
              becomes unmanageable. Do not set this value to true  indiscrimi-
              nately.

              For  more  information, refer to the scenario in the Default Key
              Policy section in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          Use this parameter only when you intend  to  prevent  the  principal
          that is making the request from making a subsequent PutKeyPolicy re-
          quest on the KMS key.

          The default value is false.

       --description (string)
          A description of the KMS key. The default value is an  empty  string
          (no description).

          The  description  is not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You
          can specify the same description or a different description for each
          key  in a set of related multi-Region keys. KMS does not synchronize
          this property.

       --tags (list)
          Assigns one or more tags to the replica key. Use this  parameter  to
          tag  the KMS key when it is created. To tag an existing KMS key, use
          the  TagResource operation.

          NOTE:
              Tagging or untagging a KMS key can allow or deny  permission  to
              the  KMS key. For details, see Using ABAC in KMS in the Key Man-
              agement Service Developer Guide .

          To use this parameter, you must have kms:TagResource  permission  in
          an IAM policy.

          Tags are not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You can specify
          the same tags or different tags for each key in  a  set  of  related
          multi-Region keys. KMS does not synchronize this property.

          Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Both the tag key and
          the tag value are required, but the tag value can be an empty (null)
          string. You cannot have more than one tag on a KMS key with the same
          tag key. If you specify an existing tag key  with  a  different  tag
          value, KMS replaces the current tag value with the specified one.

          When  you  add  tags  to an Amazon Web Services resource, Amazon Web
          Services generates a cost allocation report with usage and costs ag-
          gregated  by  tags. Tags can also be used to control access to a KMS
          key. For details, see Tagging Keys .

          (structure)
              A key-value pair. A tag consists of a tag key and a  tag  value.
              Tag keys and tag values are both required, but tag values can be
              empty (null) strings.

              For information about the rules that apply to tag keys  and  tag
              values, see User-Defined Tag Restrictions in the Amazon Web Ser-
              vices Billing and Cost Management User Guide .

              TagKey -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

              TagValue -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TagKey=string,TagValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "TagKey": "string",
              "TagValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ReplicaKeyMetadata -> (structure)
          Displays details about the new replica key, including its Amazon Re-
          source Name (key ARN ) and key state . It also includes the ARN  and
          Amazon  Web  Services  Region  of  its primary key and other replica
          keys.

          AWSAccountId -> (string)
              The twelve-digit account ID of the Amazon Web  Services  account
              that owns the KMS key.

          KeyId -> (string)
              The globally unique identifier for the KMS key.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key. For examples, see
              Key Management Service (KMS) in the Example ARNs section of  the
              Amazon Web Services General Reference .

          CreationDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the KMS key was created.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  the KMS key is enabled. When KeyState is En-
              abled this value is true, otherwise it is false.

          Description -> (string)
              The description of the KMS key.

          KeyUsage -> (string)
              The cryptographic operations for which you can use the KMS key.

          KeyState -> (string)
              The current status of the KMS key.

              For more information about how key state affects the  use  of  a
              KMS  key,  see Key state: Effect on your KMS key in the Key Man-
              agement Service Developer Guide .

          DeletionDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time after which KMS deletes  this  KMS  key.  This
              value  is  present  only when the KMS key is scheduled for dele-
              tion, that is, when its KeyState is PendingDeletion .

              When the primary key in a  multi-Region  key  is  scheduled  for
              deletion  but  still  has replica keys, its key state is Pendin-
              gReplicaDeletion and the length of its waiting  period  is  dis-
              played in the PendingDeletionWindowInDays field.

          ValidTo -> (timestamp)
              The  time  at  which the imported key material expires. When the
              key material expires, KMS deletes the key material and  the  KMS
              key  becomes  unusable.  This value is present only for KMS keys
              whose Origin is EXTERNAL and whose ExpirationModel is  KEY_MATE-
              RIAL_EXPIRES , otherwise this value is omitted.

          Origin -> (string)
              The  source of the key material for the KMS key. When this value
              is AWS_KMS , KMS created the key material. When  this  value  is
              EXTERNAL  , the key material was imported or the KMS key doesn't
              have any key material. When this value is AWS_CLOUDHSM , the key
              material  was  created in the CloudHSM cluster associated with a
              custom key store.

          CustomKeyStoreId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the custom key store that  contains  the
              KMS  key. This value is present only when the KMS key is created
              in a custom key store.

          CloudHsmClusterId -> (string)
              The cluster ID of the CloudHSM cluster that contains the key ma-
              terial  for  the  KMS key. When you create a KMS key in a custom
              key store , KMS creates the key material for the KMS key in  the
              associated CloudHSM cluster. This value is present only when the
              KMS key is created in a custom key store.

          ExpirationModel -> (string)
              Specifies whether the KMS key's key material expires. This value
              is  present  only when Origin is EXTERNAL , otherwise this value
              is omitted.

          KeyManager -> (string)
              The manager of the KMS key. KMS keys in your Amazon Web Services
              account  are either customer managed or Amazon Web Services man-
              aged. For more information about the difference, see KMS keys in
              the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          CustomerMasterKeySpec -> (string)
              Instead, use the KeySpec field.

              The  KeySpec  and  CustomerMasterKeySpec  fields  have  the same
              value. We recommend that you use the KeySpec field in your code.
              However,  to  avoid  breaking  changes,  KMS  will  support both
              fields.

          KeySpec -> (string)
              Describes the type of key material in the KMS key.

          EncryptionAlgorithms -> (list)
              The encryption algorithms that the KMS key supports. You  cannot
              use the KMS key with other encryption algorithms within KMS.

              This  value  is present only when the KeyUsage of the KMS key is
              ENCRYPT_DECRYPT .

              (string)

          SigningAlgorithms -> (list)
              The signing algorithms that the KMS key supports. You cannot use
              the KMS key with other signing algorithms within KMS.

              This  field  appears  only  when  the KeyUsage of the KMS key is
              SIGN_VERIFY .

              (string)

          MultiRegion -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether the KMS key is a multi-Region (True )  or  re-
              gional (False ) key. This value is True for multi-Region primary
              and replica keys and False for regional KMS keys.

              For  more  information  about  multi-Region  keys,   see   Using
              multi-Region  keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide
              .

          MultiRegionConfiguration -> (structure)
              Lists the primary and replica keys  in  same  multi-Region  key.
              This  field  is  present  only when the value of the MultiRegion
              field is True .

              For more information about any listed  KMS  key,  use  the   De-
              scribeKey operation.

              o MultiRegionKeyType  indicates whether the KMS key is a PRIMARY
                or REPLICA key.

              o PrimaryKey displays the key ARN and Region of the primary key.
                This  field  displays the current KMS key if it is the primary
                key.

              o ReplicaKeys displays the key ARNs and Regions of  all  replica
                keys.  This  field  includes  the  current  KMS key if it is a
                replica key.

              MultiRegionKeyType -> (string)
                 Indicates whether the KMS key is a PRIMARY or REPLICA key.

              PrimaryKey -> (structure)
                 Displays the key ARN and Region  of  the  primary  key.  This
                 field includes the current KMS key if it is the primary key.

                 Arn -> (string)
                     Displays  the  key  ARN  of a primary or replica key of a
                     multi-Region key.

                 Region -> (string)
                     Displays the Amazon Web Services Region of a  primary  or
                     replica key in a multi-Region key.

              ReplicaKeys -> (list)
                 displays  the  key ARNs and Regions of all replica keys. This
                 field includes the current KMS key if it is a replica key.

                 (structure)
                     Describes the primary or replica key  in  a  multi-Region
                     key.

                     Arn -> (string)
                        Displays  the key ARN of a primary or replica key of a
                        multi-Region key.

                     Region -> (string)
                        Displays the Amazon Web Services Region of  a  primary
                        or replica key in a multi-Region key.

          PendingDeletionWindowInDays -> (integer)
              The  waiting period before the primary key in a multi-Region key
              is deleted. This waiting period begins  when  the  last  of  its
              replica  keys  is  deleted.  This value is present only when the
              KeyState of the KMS key is PendingReplicaDeletion .  That  indi-
              cates that the KMS key is the primary key in a multi-Region key,
              it is scheduled for deletion, and it still has existing  replica
              keys.

              When  a  single-Region  KMS key or a multi-Region replica key is
              scheduled for deletion, its deletion date is  displayed  in  the
              DeletionDate field. However, when the primary key in a multi-Re-
              gion key is scheduled for deletion, its waiting  period  doesn't
              begin until all of its replica keys are deleted. This value dis-
              plays that waiting period. When the  last  replica  key  in  the
              multi-Region  key is deleted, the KeyState of the scheduled pri-
              mary key changes from PendingReplicaDeletion to  PendingDeletion
              and the deletion date appears in the DeletionDate field.

       ReplicaPolicy -> (string)
          The  key  policy  of  the new replica key. The value is a key policy
          document in JSON format.

       ReplicaTags -> (list)
          The tags on the new replica key. The value is a list of tag key  and
          tag value pairs.

          (structure)
              A  key-value  pair. A tag consists of a tag key and a tag value.
              Tag keys and tag values are both required, but tag values can be
              empty (null) strings.

              For  information  about the rules that apply to tag keys and tag
              values, see User-Defined Tag Restrictions in the Amazon Web Ser-
              vices Billing and Cost Management User Guide .

              TagKey -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

              TagValue -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.
