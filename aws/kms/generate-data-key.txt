GENERATE-DATA-KEY()                                        GENERATE-DATA-KEY()



NAME
       generate-data-key -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a unique symmetric data key for use outside of KMS. This opera-
       tion returns a plaintext copy of the data key and a copy  that  is  en-
       crypted  under  a  symmetric  encryption  KMS key that you specify. The
       bytes in the plaintext key are random; they  are  not  related  to  the
       caller  or  the  KMS key. You can use the plaintext key to encrypt your
       data outside of KMS and store the encrypted data key with the encrypted
       data.

       To  generate  a data key, specify the symmetric encryption KMS key that
       will be used to encrypt the data key. You cannot use an asymmetric  KMS
       key to encrypt data keys. To get the type of your KMS key, use the  De-
       scribeKey operation. You must also specify the length of the data  key.
       Use  either the KeySpec or NumberOfBytes parameters (but not both). For
       128-bit and 256-bit data keys, use the KeySpec parameter.

       To get only an encrypted copy of the data  key,  use   GenerateDataKey-
       WithoutPlaintext  .  To  generate  an asymmetric data key pair, use the
       GenerateDataKeyPair or  GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext  operation.
       To get a cryptographically secure random byte string, use  GenerateRan-
       dom .

       You can use an optional encryption context to add  additional  security
       to  the encryption operation. If you specify an EncryptionContext , you
       must specify the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match)
       when  decrypting  the encrypted data key. Otherwise, the request to de-
       crypt fails with an InvalidCiphertextException . For more  information,
       see Encryption Context in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

       Applications in Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves can call this opera-
       tion by using the Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves Development Kit  .
       For  information  about  the  supporting parameters, see How Amazon Web
       Services Nitro Enclaves use KMS in the Key Management Service Developer
       Guide .

       The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key
       state. For details, see Key states of KMS keys in  the  Key  Management
       Service Developer Guide .
          How to use your data key

       We recommend that you use the following pattern to encrypt data locally
       in your application. You can write your own code or use  a  client-side
       encryption  library,  such  as the Amazon Web Services Encryption SDK ,
       the Amazon DynamoDB Encryption Client , or Amazon  S3  client-side  en-
       cryption to do these tasks for you.

       To encrypt data outside of KMS:

       o Use the GenerateDataKey operation to get a data key.

       o Use  the  plaintext data key (in the Plaintext field of the response)
         to encrypt your data outside of KMS. Then erase  the  plaintext  data
         key from memory.

       o Store  the encrypted data key (in the CiphertextBlob field of the re-
         sponse) with the encrypted data.

       To decrypt data outside of KMS:

       o Use the  Decrypt operation to decrypt the encrypted data key. The op-
         eration returns a plaintext copy of the data key.

       o Use the plaintext data key to decrypt data outside of KMS, then erase
         the plaintext data key from memory.
          Cross-account use : Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key in
          a  different  Amazon  Web  Services  account, specify the key ARN or
          alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.

SYNOPSIS
            generate-data-key
          --key-id <value>
          [--encryption-context <value>]
          [--number-of-bytes <value>]
          [--key-spec <value>]
          [--grant-tokens <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          Specifies the symmetric encryption KMS key that  encrypts  the  data
          key. You cannot specify an asymmetric KMS key or a KMS key in a cus-
          tom key store. To get the type and origin of your KMS key,  use  the
          DescribeKey operation.

          To  specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias
          ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with "alias/" . To  specify
          a  KMS  key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you must use
          the key ARN or alias ARN.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Alias name: alias/ExampleAlias

          o Alias ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias

          To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys  or   De-
          scribeKey . To get the alias name and alias ARN, use  ListAliases .

       --encryption-context (map)
          Specifies  the  encryption context that will be used when encrypting
          the data key.

          An encryption context is a collection of non-secret key-value  pairs
          that  represent  additional  authenticated data. When you use an en-
          cryption context to encrypt data, you must specify the same (an  ex-
          act case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data. An
          encryption context is supported only on  operations  with  symmetric
          encryption  KMS  keys.  On  operations with symmetric encryption KMS
          keys, an encryption context is optional, but it is  strongly  recom-
          mended.

          For  more  information, see Encryption context in the Key Management
          Service Developer Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --number-of-bytes (integer)
          Specifies the length of the data key in bytes. For example, use  the
          value  64 to generate a 512-bit data key (64 bytes is 512 bits). For
          128-bit (16-byte) and 256-bit (32-byte) data keys, use  the  KeySpec
          parameter.

          You  must  specify either the KeySpec or the NumberOfBytes parameter
          (but not both) in every GenerateDataKey request.

       --key-spec (string)
          Specifies the length of the data key.  Use  AES_128  to  generate  a
          128-bit  symmetric  key,  or AES_256 to generate a 256-bit symmetric
          key.

          You must specify either the KeySpec or the  NumberOfBytes  parameter
          (but not both) in every GenerateDataKey request.

          Possible values:

          o AES_256

          o AES_128

       --grant-tokens (list)
          A list of grant tokens.

          Use  a grant token when your permission to call this operation comes
          from a new grant that has not yet achieved  eventual  consistency  .
          For more information, see Grant token and Using a grant token in the
          Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CiphertextBlob -> (blob)
          The encrypted copy of the data key. When you use the HTTP API or the
          Amazon Web Services CLI, the value is Base64-encoded. Otherwise,  it
          is not Base64-encoded.

       Plaintext -> (blob)
          The  plaintext data key. When you use the HTTP API or the Amazon Web
          Services CLI, the value is  Base64-encoded.  Otherwise,  it  is  not
          Base64-encoded.  Use  this  data key to encrypt your data outside of
          KMS. Then, remove it from memory as soon as possible.

       KeyId -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (key ARN ) of the KMS  key  that  encrypted
          the data key.
