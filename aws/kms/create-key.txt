CREATE-KEY()                                                      CREATE-KEY()



NAME
       create-key -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  unique customer managed KMS key in your Amazon Web Services
       account and Region.

       NOTE:
          KMS is replacing the term customer master key (CMK) with KMS key and
          KMS  key . The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes,
          KMS is keeping some variations of this term.

       You can use the CreateKey operation to create symmetric  or  asymmetric
       KMS keys.

       o Symmetric  KMS keys contain a 256-bit symmetric key that never leaves
         KMS unencrypted. To use the KMS key, you must call KMS. You can use a
         symmetric  KMS  key to encrypt and decrypt small amounts of data, but
         they are typically used to generate data keys and data keys  pairs  .
         For details, see  GenerateDataKey and  GenerateDataKeyPair .

       o Asymmetric  KMS keys can contain an RSA key pair or an Elliptic Curve
         (ECC) key pair. The private key in an asymmetric KMS key never leaves
         KMS  unencrypted. However, you can use the  GetPublicKey operation to
         download the public key so it can be used outside of  KMS.  KMS  keys
         with RSA key pairs can be used to encrypt or decrypt data or sign and
         verify messages (but not both). KMS keys with ECC key  pairs  can  be
         used only to sign and verify messages.

       For information about symmetric and asymmetric KMS keys, see Using Sym-
       metric and Asymmetric KMS keys in the Key Management Service  Developer
       Guide .

       To create different types of KMS keys, use the following guidance:
          Asymmetric KMS keys

       To  create  an asymmetric KMS key, use the KeySpec parameter to specify
       the type of key material in the KMS key. Then, use the KeyUsage parame-
       ter  to  determine  whether the KMS key will be used to encrypt and de-
       crypt or sign and verify. You can't change these properties  after  the
       KMS key is created.
          Symmetric KMS keys

       When  creating  a  symmetric  KMS  key,  you  don't need to specify the
       KeySpec or KeyUsage parameters. The default value for KeySpec , SYMMET-
       RIC_DEFAULT  ,  and  the default value for KeyUsage , ENCRYPT_DECRYPT ,
       are the only valid values for symmetric KMS keys.
          Multi-Region primary keys Imported key material

       To create a multi-Region primary key in the local Amazon  Web  Services
       Region,  use the MultiRegion parameter with a value of True . To create
       a multi-Region replica key , that is, a KMS key with the  same  key  ID
       and  key  material as a primary key, but in a different Amazon Web Ser-
       vices Region, use the  ReplicateKey operation. To change a replica  key
       to  a  primary  key, and its primary key to a replica key, use the  Up-
       datePrimaryRegion operation.

       This operation supports multi-Region keys , an KMS  feature  that  lets
       you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web Ser-
       vices Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID,  key  mate-
       rial,  and  other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to encrypt
       data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it  in  a  different
       Amazon  Web  Services Region without re-encrypting the data or making a
       cross-Region call. For more information about  multi-Region  keys,  see
       Using multi-Region keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

       You can create symmetric and asymmetric multi-Region keys and multi-Re-
       gion keys with imported key material. You  cannot  create  multi-Region
       keys in a custom key store.

       To  import your own key material, begin by creating a symmetric KMS key
       with no key material. To do this, use the Origin parameter of CreateKey
       with  a value of EXTERNAL . Next, use  GetParametersForImport operation
       to get a public key and import token, and use the public key to encrypt
       your  key material. Then, use  ImportKeyMaterial with your import token
       to  import  the  key  material.  For  step-by-step  instructions,   see
       Importing  Key Material in the * Key Management Service Developer Guide
       * . You cannot import the key material into an asymmetric KMS key.

       To create a multi-Region primary key with imported  key  material,  use
       the Origin parameter of CreateKey with a value of EXTERNAL and the Mul-
       tiRegion parameter with a value of True . To  create  replicas  of  the
       multi-Region primary key, use the  ReplicateKey operation. For more in-
       formation about multi-Region keys, see Using multi-Region keys  in  the
       Key Management Service Developer Guide .
          Custom key store

       To  create  a  symmetric  KMS  key in a custom key store , use the Cus-
       tomKeyStoreId parameter to specify the custom key store. You must  also
       use  the  Origin  parameter with a value of AWS_CLOUDHSM . The CloudHSM
       cluster that is associated with the custom key store must have at least
       two  active HSMs in different Availability Zones in the Amazon Web Ser-
       vices Region.

       You cannot create an asymmetric KMS key in a custom key store. For  in-
       formation about custom key stores in KMS see Using Custom Key Stores in
       the * Key Management Service Developer Guide * .
          Cross-account use : No. You cannot use this operation  to  create  a
          KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account.

          Required  permissions  : kms:CreateKey (IAM policy). To use the Tags
          parameter, kms:TagResource (IAM policy). For examples  and  informa-
          tion  about related permissions, see Allow a user to create KMS keys
          in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --policy (string)
          The key policy to attach to the KMS key.

          If you provide a key policy, it must meet the following criteria:

          o If you don't set BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck to true,  the  key
            policy  must  allow the principal that is making the CreateKey re-
            quest to make a subsequent  PutKeyPolicy request on the  KMS  key.
            This  reduces  the risk that the KMS key becomes unmanageable. For
            more information, refer to the scenario in the Default Key  Policy
            section of the * Key Management Service Developer Guide * .

          o Each  statement in the key policy must contain one or more princi-
            pals. The principals in the key policy must exist and  be  visible
            to  KMS.  When you create a new Amazon Web Services principal (for
            example, an IAM user or role), you might need to enforce  a  delay
            before including the new principal in a key policy because the new
            principal might not be immediately visible to KMS. For more infor-
            mation, see Changes that I make are not always immediately visible
            in the Amazon Web Services Identity  and  Access  Management  User
            Guide .

          If  you do not provide a key policy, KMS attaches a default key pol-
          icy to the KMS key. For more information, see Default Key Policy  in
          the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          The key policy size quota is 32 kilobytes (32768 bytes).

          For  help writing and formatting a JSON policy document, see the IAM
          JSON Policy Reference in the * Identity and Access  Management  User
          Guide * .

       --description (string)
          A description of the KMS key.

          Use  a  description that helps you decide whether the KMS key is ap-
          propriate for a task. The default value is an empty string  (no  de-
          scription).

          To  set or change the description after the key is created, use  Up-
          dateKeyDescription .

       --key-usage (string)
          Determines the cryptographic operations for which you  can  use  the
          KMS  key.  The  default value is ENCRYPT_DECRYPT . This parameter is
          required only for asymmetric KMS keys. You can't change the KeyUsage
          value after the KMS key is created.

          Select only one valid value.

          o For  symmetric KMS keys, omit the parameter or specify ENCRYPT_DE-
            CRYPT .

          o For asymmetric KMS keys with RSA key material, specify ENCRYPT_DE-
            CRYPT or SIGN_VERIFY .

          o For asymmetric KMS keys with ECC key material, specify SIGN_VERIFY
            .

          Possible values:

          o SIGN_VERIFY

          o ENCRYPT_DECRYPT

       --customer-master-key-spec (string)
          Instead, use the KeySpec parameter.

          The KeySpec and CustomerMasterKeySpec parameters work the same  way.
          Only  the  names differ. We recommend that you use KeySpec parameter
          in your code. However, to avoid breaking changes, KMS  will  support
          both parameters.

          Possible values:

          o RSA_2048

          o RSA_3072

          o RSA_4096

          o ECC_NIST_P256

          o ECC_NIST_P384

          o ECC_NIST_P521

          o ECC_SECG_P256K1

          o SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT

       --key-spec (string)
          Specifies  the type of KMS key to create. The default value, SYMMET-
          RIC_DEFAULT , creates a KMS key with a 256-bit symmetric key for en-
          cryption  and  decryption. For help choosing a key spec for your KMS
          key, see How to Choose Your KMS key Configuration in the * Key  Man-
          agement Service Developer Guide * .

          The  KeySpec determines whether the KMS key contains a symmetric key
          or an asymmetric key pair. It also determines the  encryption  algo-
          rithms  or  signing  algorithms that the KMS key supports. You can't
          change the KeySpec after the KMS key is created. To further restrict
          the  algorithms  that  can be used with the KMS key, use a condition
          key in its key policy or  IAM  policy.  For  more  information,  see
          kms:EncryptionAlgorithm  or  kms:Signing Algorithm in the * Key Man-
          agement Service Developer Guide * .

          WARNING:
              Amazon Web Services services that are integrated  with  KMS  use
              symmetric  KMS  keys to protect your data. These services do not
              support asymmetric KMS keys. For help determining whether a  KMS
              key  is  symmetric  or asymmetric, see Identifying Symmetric and
              Asymmetric KMS keys in  the  Key  Management  Service  Developer
              Guide .

          KMS supports the following key specs for KMS keys:

          o Symmetric key (default)

            o SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT (AES-256-GCM)

          o Asymmetric RSA key pairs

            o RSA_2048

            o RSA_3072

            o RSA_4096

          o Asymmetric NIST-recommended elliptic curve key pairs

            o ECC_NIST_P256 (secp256r1)

            o ECC_NIST_P384 (secp384r1)

            o ECC_NIST_P521 (secp521r1)

          o Other asymmetric elliptic curve key pairs

            o ECC_SECG_P256K1 (secp256k1), commonly used for cryptocurrencies.

          Possible values:

          o RSA_2048

          o RSA_3072

          o RSA_4096

          o ECC_NIST_P256

          o ECC_NIST_P384

          o ECC_NIST_P521

          o ECC_SECG_P256K1

          o SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT

       --origin (string)
          The  source  of  the key material for the KMS key. You cannot change
          the origin after you create the KMS key. The default  is  AWS_KMS  ,
          which means that KMS creates the key material.

          To  create  a  KMS  key with no key material (for imported key mate-
          rial), set the value to EXTERNAL . For more  information  about  im-
          porting key material into KMS, see Importing Key Material in the Key
          Management Service Developer Guide . This value is  valid  only  for
          symmetric KMS keys.

          To  create  a  KMS key in an KMS custom key store and create its key
          material in the associated  CloudHSM  cluster,  set  this  value  to
          AWS_CLOUDHSM  .  You must also use the CustomKeyStoreId parameter to
          identify the custom key store. This value is valid only for  symmet-
          ric KMS keys.

          Possible values:

          o AWS_KMS

          o EXTERNAL

          o AWS_CLOUDHSM

       --custom-key-store-id (string)
          Creates  the  KMS  key in the specified custom key store and the key
          material in its associated CloudHSM cluster. To create a KMS key  in
          a  custom key store, you must also specify the Origin parameter with
          a value of AWS_CLOUDHSM . The CloudHSM cluster  that  is  associated
          with  the  custom key store must have at least two active HSMs, each
          in a different Availability Zone in the Region.

          This parameter is valid only for symmetric KMS keys and regional KMS
          keys.  You cannot create an asymmetric KMS key or a multi-Region key
          in a custom key store.

          To find the ID of a custom key store,  use  the   DescribeCustomKey-
          Stores operation.

          The  response  includes  the  custom  key store ID and the ID of the
          CloudHSM cluster.

          This operation is part of the Custom Key Store  feature  feature  in
          KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS
          with the isolation and control of a single-tenant key store.

       --bypass-policy-lockout-safety-check     |     --no-bypass-policy-lock-
       out-safety-check (boolean)
          A  flag  to indicate whether to bypass the key policy lockout safety
          check.

          WARNING:
              Setting this value to true increases the risk that the  KMS  key
              becomes  unmanageable. Do not set this value to true indiscrimi-
              nately.

              For more information, refer to the scenario in the  Default  Key
              Policy section in the * Key Management Service Developer Guide *
              .

          Use this parameter only when you include a policy in the request and
          you  intend to prevent the principal that is making the request from
          making a subsequent  PutKeyPolicy request on the KMS key.

          The default value is false.

       --tags (list)
          Assigns one or more tags to the KMS key. Use this parameter  to  tag
          the  KMS key when it is created. To tag an existing KMS key, use the
          TagResource operation.

          NOTE:
              Tagging or untagging a KMS key can allow or deny  permission  to
              the  KMS key. For details, see Using ABAC in KMS in the Key Man-
              agement Service Developer Guide .

          To use this parameter, you must have kms:TagResource  permission  in
          an IAM policy.

          Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Both the tag key and
          the tag value are required, but the tag value can be an empty (null)
          string. You cannot have more than one tag on a KMS key with the same
          tag key. If you specify an existing tag key  with  a  different  tag
          value, KMS replaces the current tag value with the specified one.

          When  you  add  tags  to an Amazon Web Services resource, Amazon Web
          Services generates a cost allocation report with usage and costs ag-
          gregated  by  tags. Tags can also be used to control access to a KMS
          key. For details, see Tagging Keys .

          (structure)
              A key-value pair. A tag consists of a tag key and a  tag  value.
              Tag keys and tag values are both required, but tag values can be
              empty (null) strings.

              For information about the rules that apply to tag keys  and  tag
              values, see User-Defined Tag Restrictions in the Amazon Web Ser-
              vices Billing and Cost Management User Guide .

              TagKey -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

              TagValue -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TagKey=string,TagValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "TagKey": "string",
              "TagValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --multi-region | --no-multi-region (boolean)
          Creates a multi-Region primary key that you can replicate into other
          Amazon  Web Services Regions. You cannot change this value after you
          create the KMS key.

          For a multi-Region key, set this parameter to  True  .  For  a  sin-
          gle-Region KMS key, omit this parameter or set it to False . The de-
          fault value is False .

          This operation supports multi-Region keys , an KMS feature that lets
          you  create  multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web
          Services Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key  ID,  key
          material,  and  other  metadata, you can use them interchangeably to
          encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it  in  a
          different  Amazon Web Services Region without re-encrypting the data
          or making a cross-Region call. For more information about  multi-Re-
          gion keys, see Using multi-Region keys in the Key Management Service
          Developer Guide .

          This value creates a primary key  ,  not  a  replica.  To  create  a
          replica key , use the  ReplicateKey operation.

          You  can  create a symmetric or asymmetric multi-Region key, and you
          can create a multi-Region key with imported key  material.  However,
          you cannot create a multi-Region key in a custom key store.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a customer managed CMK in AWS KMS

       The following create-key example creates a customer managed CMK.

       o The  --tags  parameter  uses shorthand syntax to add a tag with a key
         name Purpose and value of Test. For information about using shorthand
         syntax,  see  Using Shorthand Syntax with the AWS Command Line Inter-
         face in the AWS CLI User Guide.

       o The --description parameter adds an optional description.

       Because this doesn't specify a policy, the CMK  gets  the  default  key
       policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-poli-
       cies.html#key-policy-default>__.  To  view  the  key  policy,  use  the
       ``get-key-policy`   command.   To   change  the  key  policy,  use  the
       put-key-policy command.

          aws kms create-key \
              --tags TagKey=Purpose,TagValue=Test \
              --description "Development test key"

       The create-key command returns the key metadata, including the  key  ID
       and ARN of the new CMK. You can use these values to identify the CMK to
       other AWS KMS operations. The output does not include the tags. To view
       the tags for a CMK, use the list-resource-tags command.

OUTPUT
       KeyMetadata -> (structure)
          Metadata associated with the KMS key.

          AWSAccountId -> (string)
              The  twelve-digit  account ID of the Amazon Web Services account
              that owns the KMS key.

          KeyId -> (string)
              The globally unique identifier for the KMS key.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key. For examples, see
              Key  Management Service (KMS) in the Example ARNs section of the
              Amazon Web Services General Reference .

          CreationDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the KMS key was created.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the KMS key is enabled. When KeyState  is  En-
              abled this value is true, otherwise it is false.

          Description -> (string)
              The description of the KMS key.

          KeyUsage -> (string)
              The cryptographic operations for which you can use the KMS key.

          KeyState -> (string)
              The current status of the KMS key.

              For  more  information  about how key state affects the use of a
              KMS key, see Key state: Effect on your KMS key in the  Key  Man-
              agement Service Developer Guide .

          DeletionDate -> (timestamp)
              The  date  and  time  after which KMS deletes this KMS key. This
              value is present only when the KMS key is  scheduled  for  dele-
              tion, that is, when its KeyState is PendingDeletion .

              When  the  primary  key  in  a multi-Region key is scheduled for
              deletion but still has replica keys, its key  state  is  Pendin-
              gReplicaDeletion  and  the  length of its waiting period is dis-
              played in the PendingDeletionWindowInDays field.

          ValidTo -> (timestamp)
              The time at which the imported key material  expires.  When  the
              key  material  expires, KMS deletes the key material and the KMS
              key becomes unusable. This value is present only  for  KMS  keys
              whose  Origin is EXTERNAL and whose ExpirationModel is KEY_MATE-
              RIAL_EXPIRES , otherwise this value is omitted.

          Origin -> (string)
              The source of the key material for the KMS key. When this  value
              is  AWS_KMS  ,  KMS created the key material. When this value is
              EXTERNAL , the key material was imported or the KMS key  doesn't
              have any key material. When this value is AWS_CLOUDHSM , the key
              material was created in the CloudHSM cluster associated  with  a
              custom key store.

          CustomKeyStoreId -> (string)
              A  unique  identifier for the custom key store that contains the
              KMS key. This value is present only when the KMS key is  created
              in a custom key store.

          CloudHsmClusterId -> (string)
              The cluster ID of the CloudHSM cluster that contains the key ma-
              terial for the KMS key. When you create a KMS key  in  a  custom
              key  store , KMS creates the key material for the KMS key in the
              associated CloudHSM cluster. This value is present only when the
              KMS key is created in a custom key store.

          ExpirationModel -> (string)
              Specifies whether the KMS key's key material expires. This value
              is present only when Origin is EXTERNAL , otherwise  this  value
              is omitted.

          KeyManager -> (string)
              The manager of the KMS key. KMS keys in your Amazon Web Services
              account are either customer managed or Amazon Web Services  man-
              aged. For more information about the difference, see KMS keys in
              the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          CustomerMasterKeySpec -> (string)
              Instead, use the KeySpec field.

              The KeySpec  and  CustomerMasterKeySpec  fields  have  the  same
              value. We recommend that you use the KeySpec field in your code.
              However, to  avoid  breaking  changes,  KMS  will  support  both
              fields.

          KeySpec -> (string)
              Describes the type of key material in the KMS key.

          EncryptionAlgorithms -> (list)
              The  encryption algorithms that the KMS key supports. You cannot
              use the KMS key with other encryption algorithms within KMS.

              This value is present only when the KeyUsage of the KMS  key  is
              ENCRYPT_DECRYPT .

              (string)

          SigningAlgorithms -> (list)
              The signing algorithms that the KMS key supports. You cannot use
              the KMS key with other signing algorithms within KMS.

              This field appears only when the KeyUsage  of  the  KMS  key  is
              SIGN_VERIFY .

              (string)

          MultiRegion -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether  the KMS key is a multi-Region (True ) or re-
              gional (False ) key. This value is True for multi-Region primary
              and replica keys and False for regional KMS keys.

              For   more   information  about  multi-Region  keys,  see  Using
              multi-Region keys in the Key Management Service Developer  Guide
              .

          MultiRegionConfiguration -> (structure)
              Lists  the  primary  and  replica keys in same multi-Region key.
              This field is present only when the  value  of  the  MultiRegion
              field is True .

              For  more  information  about  any  listed KMS key, use the  De-
              scribeKey operation.

              o MultiRegionKeyType indicates whether the KMS key is a  PRIMARY
                or REPLICA key.

              o PrimaryKey displays the key ARN and Region of the primary key.
                This field displays the current KMS key if it is  the  primary
                key.

              o ReplicaKeys  displays  the key ARNs and Regions of all replica
                keys. This field includes the current  KMS  key  if  it  is  a
                replica key.

              MultiRegionKeyType -> (string)
                 Indicates whether the KMS key is a PRIMARY or REPLICA key.

              PrimaryKey -> (structure)
                 Displays  the  key  ARN  and  Region of the primary key. This
                 field includes the current KMS key if it is the primary key.

                 Arn -> (string)
                     Displays the key ARN of a primary or  replica  key  of  a
                     multi-Region key.

                 Region -> (string)
                     Displays  the  Amazon Web Services Region of a primary or
                     replica key in a multi-Region key.

              ReplicaKeys -> (list)
                 displays the key ARNs and Regions of all replica  keys.  This
                 field includes the current KMS key if it is a replica key.

                 (structure)
                     Describes  the  primary  or replica key in a multi-Region
                     key.

                     Arn -> (string)
                        Displays the key ARN of a primary or replica key of  a
                        multi-Region key.

                     Region -> (string)
                        Displays  the  Amazon Web Services Region of a primary
                        or replica key in a multi-Region key.

          PendingDeletionWindowInDays -> (integer)
              The waiting period before the primary key in a multi-Region  key
              is  deleted.  This  waiting  period  begins when the last of its
              replica keys is deleted. This value is  present  only  when  the
              KeyState  of  the KMS key is PendingReplicaDeletion . That indi-
              cates that the KMS key is the primary key in a multi-Region key,
              it  is scheduled for deletion, and it still has existing replica
              keys.

              When a single-Region KMS key or a multi-Region  replica  key  is
              scheduled  for  deletion,  its deletion date is displayed in the
              DeletionDate field. However, when the primary key in a multi-Re-
              gion  key  is scheduled for deletion, its waiting period doesn't
              begin until all of its replica keys are deleted. This value dis-
              plays  that  waiting  period.  When  the last replica key in the
              multi-Region key is deleted, the KeyState of the scheduled  pri-
              mary  key changes from PendingReplicaDeletion to PendingDeletion
              and the deletion date appears in the DeletionDate field.
