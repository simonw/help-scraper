NAME
       export-components -

DESCRIPTION
       Exports  component  configurations  to  code that is ready to integrate
       into an Amplify app.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            export-components
          --app-id <value>
          --environment-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --app-id (string)
          The unique ID of the Amplify app to export components to.

       --environment-name (string)
          The name of the backend environment that is a part  of  the  Amplify
          app.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       entities -> (list)
          Represents the configuration of the exported components.

          (structure)
              Contains the configuration settings for a  user  interface  (UI)
              element  for an Amplify app. A component is configured as a pri-
              mary, stand-alone UI element. Use ComponentChild to configure an
              instance of a Component . A ComponentChild instance inherits the
              configuration of the main Component .

              appId -> (string)
                 The unique ID of the Amplify app associated with  the  compo-
                 nent.

                     to add exposed properties to a component to allow differ-
                     ent  values  to  be entered when a component is reused in
