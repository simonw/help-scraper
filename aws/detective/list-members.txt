NAME
       list-members -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the list of member accounts for a behavior graph.

       For  invited  accounts, the results do not include member accounts that
       were removed from the behavior graph.

       For the organization behavior graph, the results do not include organi-
       zation  accounts  that  the Detective administrator account has not en-
       abled as member accounts.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-members
          --graph-arn <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --graph-arn (string)
          The ARN of the behavior graph for which to retrieve the list of mem-
          ber accounts.

       --next-token (string)
          For  requests  to  retrieve the next page of member account results,
          the pagination token that was returned with the previous page of re-
          sults. The initial request does not include a pagination token.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of member accounts to include in the response.
          The total must be less than the overall limit on the number  of  re-
          sults to return, which is currently 200.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the member accounts in a behavior graph

       The following list-members example retrieves the  invited  and  enabled
       member    accounts    for    the    behavior    graph    arn:aws:detec-
       tive:us-east-1:111122223333:graph:123412341234. The results do not  in-
       clude member accounts that were removed.

OUTPUT
       MemberDetails -> (list)
          The list of member accounts in the behavior graph.

          For invited accounts, the results include member accounts  that  did
          not pass verification and member accounts that have not yet accepted
          the invitation to the behavior graph. The  results  do  not  include
          member accounts that were removed from the behavior graph.

          For  the organization behavior graph, the results do not include or-
          ganization accounts that the Detective administrator account has not
          enabled as member accounts.

          (structure)
              Details about a member account in a behavior graph.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account identifier for the member ac-
                 count.

              EmailAddress -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account root user email  address  for
                 the member account.

              GraphArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the behavior graph.

              MasterId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account identifier of the administra-
                 tor account for the behavior graph.

              AdministratorId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account identifier of the administra-
                 tor account for the behavior graph.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current membership status of the member account. The sta-
                 tus can have one of the following values:

                 o INVITED - For invited accounts  only.  Indicates  that  the
                   member was sent an invitation but has not yet responded.

                 o VERIFICATION_IN_PROGRESS - For invited accounts only, indi-
                   cates that Detective is verifying that the account  identi-
                   fier  and  email  address  provided  for the member account
                   match. If they do match, then Detective sends  the  invita-
                   tion.  If  the  email  address and account identifier don't
                   match, then the member cannot  be  added  to  the  behavior
                   graph. For organization accounts in the organization behav-
                   ior graph, indicates that Detective is verifying  that  the
                   account belongs to the organization.

                 o VERIFICATION_FAILED  - For invited accounts only. Indicates
                   that the account and email address provided for the  member
                   account do not match, and Detective did not send an invita-
                   tion to the account.

                 o ENABLED - Indicates that the member account currently  con-
                   tributes  data to the behavior graph. For invited accounts,
                   the member account accepted the invitation.  For  organiza-
                   tion  accounts  in the organization behavior graph, the De-
                   tective administrator account enabled the organization  ac-
                   count as a member account.

                 o ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED  -  The  account accepted the invita-
                   tion, or was enabled by  the  Detective  administrator  ac-
                   count,  but  is prevented from contributing data to the be-
                   havior graph. DisabledReason provides the  reason  why  the
                   member account is not enabled.

                 Invited accounts that declined an invitation or that were re-
                 moved from the behavior graph are not included. In the  orga-
                 nization  behavior  graph, organization accounts that the De-
                 tective administrator account did  not  enable  are  not  in-
                 cluded.

              DisabledReason -> (string)
                 For  member accounts with a status of ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED ,
                 the reason that the member account is not enabled.

                 The reason can have one of the following values:

                 o VOLUME_TOO_HIGH - Indicates that adding the member  account
                   would  cause  the  data volume for the behavior graph to be
                   too high.

                 o VOLUME_UNKNOWN - Indicates that Detective is unable to ver-
                   ify the data volume for the member account. This is usually
                   because the member account is not enrolled in Amazon Guard-
                   Duty.

              InvitedTime -> (timestamp)
                 For  invited  accounts, the date and time that Detective sent
                 the invitation to the account. The value is an  ISO8601  for-
                 matted string. For example, 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              UpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and time that the member account was last updated.
                 The value  is  an  ISO8601  formatted  string.  For  example,
                 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              VolumeUsageInBytes -> (long)
                 The data volume in bytes per day for the member account.

              VolumeUsageUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  data  and  time  when the member account data volume was
                 last updated. The value is an ISO8601 formatted  string.  For
                 example, 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              PercentOfGraphUtilization -> (double)
                 The member account data volume as a percentage of the maximum
                 allowed data volume. 0 indicates 0 percent, and 100 indicates
                 100 percent.

                 Note  that  this  is not the percentage of the behavior graph
                 data volume.

                 For example, the data volume for the behavior graph is 80  GB
                 per  day.  The  maximum data volume is 160 GB per day. If the
                 data volume for the member account is 40  GB  per  day,  then
                 PercentOfGraphUtilization  is  25.  It  represents 25% of the
                 maximum allowed data volume.

              PercentOfGraphUtilizationUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the graph utilization  percentage  was
                 last  updated.  The value is an ISO8601 formatted string. For
                 example, 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              InvitationType -> (string)
                 The type of behavior graph membership.

                 For an organization  account  in  the  organization  behavior
                 graph, the type is ORGANIZATION .

                 For an account that was invited to a behavior graph, the type
                 is INVITATION .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If there are more member accounts remaining in the results, then use
          this pagination token to request the next page of member accounts.



                                                                LIST-MEMBERS()
