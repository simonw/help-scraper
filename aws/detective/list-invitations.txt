LIST-INVITATIONS()                                          LIST-INVITATIONS()



NAME
       list-invitations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the list of open and accepted behavior graph invitations for
       the member account. This operation can only be  called  by  an  invited
       member account.

       Open  invitations  are  invitations that the member account has not re-
       sponded to.

       The results do not include behavior graphs for which the member account
       declined  the  invitation.  The  results  also  do not include behavior
       graphs that the member account resigned from or was removed from.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-invitations
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          For requests to retrieve the next page of  results,  the  pagination
          token  that was returned with the previous page of results. The ini-
          tial request does not include a pagination token.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of behavior graph invitations to  return  in  the
          response.  The total must be less than the overall limit on the num-
          ber of results to return, which is currently 200.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  view a list of behavior graphs that an account is a member of or is
       invited to

       The following list-invitations example retrieves  the  behavior  graphs
       that  the calling account has been invited to. The results include only
       open and accepted invitations. They do not include rejected invitations
       or removed memberships.

OUTPUT
       Invitations -> (list)
          The list of behavior graphs for which the member account has open or
          accepted invitations.

          (structure)
              Details about a member account in a behavior graph.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account identifier for the member ac-
                 count.

              EmailAddress -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web Services account root user email address for
                 the member account.

              GraphArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the behavior graph.

              MasterId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account identifier of the administra-
                 tor account for the behavior graph.

              AdministratorId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account identifier of the administra-
                 tor account for the behavior graph.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current membership status of the member account. The sta-
                 tus can have one of the following values:

                 o INVITED  -  For  invited  accounts only. Indicates that the
                   member was sent an invitation but has not yet responded.

                 o VERIFICATION_IN_PROGRESS - For invited accounts only, indi-
                   cates  that Detective is verifying that the account identi-
                   fier and email address  provided  for  the  member  account
                   match.  If  they do match, then Detective sends the invita-
                   tion. If the email address  and  account  identifier  don't
                   match,  then  the  member  cannot  be added to the behavior
                   graph. For organization accounts in the organization behav-
                   ior  graph,  indicates that Detective is verifying that the
                   account belongs to the organization.

                 o VERIFICATION_FAILED - For invited accounts only.  Indicates
                   that  the account and email address provided for the member
                   account do not match, and Detective did not send an invita-
                   tion to the account.

                 o ENABLED  - Indicates that the member account currently con-
                   tributes data to the behavior graph. For invited  accounts,
                   the  member  account accepted the invitation. For organiza-
                   tion accounts in the organization behavior graph,  the  De-
                   tective  administrator account enabled the organization ac-
                   count as a member account.

                 o ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED - The account  accepted  the  invita-
                   tion,  or  was  enabled  by the Detective administrator ac-
                   count, but is prevented from contributing data to  the  be-
                   havior  graph.  DisabledReason  provides the reason why the
                   member account is not enabled.

                 Invited accounts that declined an invitation or that were re-
                 moved  from the behavior graph are not included. In the orga-
                 nization behavior graph, organization accounts that  the  De-
                 tective  administrator  account  did  not  enable are not in-
                 cluded.

              DisabledReason -> (string)
                 For member accounts with a status of ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED  ,
                 the reason that the member account is not enabled.

                 The reason can have one of the following values:

                 o VOLUME_TOO_HIGH  - Indicates that adding the member account
                   would cause the data volume for the behavior  graph  to  be
                   too high.

                 o VOLUME_UNKNOWN - Indicates that Detective is unable to ver-
                   ify the data volume for the member account. This is usually
                   because the member account is not enrolled in Amazon Guard-
                   Duty.

              InvitedTime -> (timestamp)
                 For invited accounts, the date and time that  Detective  sent
                 the  invitation  to the account. The value is an ISO8601 for-
                 matted string. For example, 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              UpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the member account was  last  updated.
                 The  value  is  an  ISO8601  formatted  string.  For example,
                 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              VolumeUsageInBytes -> (long)
                 The data volume in bytes per day for the member account.

              VolumeUsageUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The data and time when the member  account  data  volume  was
                 last  updated.  The value is an ISO8601 formatted string. For
                 example, 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              PercentOfGraphUtilization -> (double)
                 The member account data volume as a percentage of the maximum
                 allowed data volume. 0 indicates 0 percent, and 100 indicates
                 100 percent.

                 Note that this is not the percentage of  the  behavior  graph
                 data volume.

                 For  example, the data volume for the behavior graph is 80 GB
                 per day. The maximum data volume is 160 GB per  day.  If  the
                 data  volume  for  the  member account is 40 GB per day, then
                 PercentOfGraphUtilization is 25. It  represents  25%  of  the
                 maximum allowed data volume.

              PercentOfGraphUtilizationUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and time when the graph utilization percentage was
                 last updated. The value is an ISO8601 formatted  string.  For
                 example, 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              InvitationType -> (string)
                 The type of behavior graph membership.

                 For  an  organization  account  in  the organization behavior
                 graph, the type is ORGANIZATION .

                 For an account that was invited to a behavior graph, the type
                 is INVITATION .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  there  are  more  behavior graphs remaining in the results, then
          this is the pagination token to use to request the next page of  be-
          havior graphs.
