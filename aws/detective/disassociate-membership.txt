DISASSOCIATE-MEMBERSHIP()                            DISASSOCIATE-MEMBERSHIP()



NAME
       disassociate-membership -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  the member account from the specified behavior graph. This op-
       eration can only be called by an invited member account  that  has  the
       ENABLED status.
          DisassociateMembership  cannot  be called by an organization account
          in the organization behavior graph. For  the  organization  behavior
          graph,  the Detective administrator account determines which organi-
          zation accounts to enable or disable as member accounts.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-membership
          --graph-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --graph-arn (string)
          The ARN of the behavior graph to remove the member account from.

          The member account's member status in the behavior graph must be EN-
          ABLED .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       that  runs  the  command  from  the   behavior   graph   arn:aws:detec-
       tive:us-east-1:111122223333:graph:123412341234.

          aws detective disassociate-membership \
