CREATE-MEMBERS()                                              CREATE-MEMBERS()



NAME
       create-members -

DESCRIPTION
          CreateMembers is used to send invitations to accounts. For the orga-
          nization behavior graph, the Detective  administrator  account  uses
          CreateMembers to enable organization accounts as member accounts.

       For invited accounts, CreateMembers sends a request to invite the spec-
       ified Amazon Web Services accounts to be member accounts in the  behav-
       ior  graph.  This operation can only be called by the administrator ac-
       count for a behavior graph.
          CreateMembers verifies the accounts and then  invites  the  verified
          accounts. The administrator can optionally specify to not send invi-
          tation emails to the member accounts. This would be  used  when  the
          administrator manages their member accounts centrally.

       For  organization  accounts in the organization behavior graph, Create-
       Members attempts to enable the accounts. The organization  accounts  do
       not receive invitations.

       The request provides the behavior graph ARN and the list of accounts to
       invite or to enable.

       The response separates the requested accounts into two lists:

       o The accounts that CreateMembers was able to process. For invited  ac-
         counts,  includes  member accounts that are being verified, that have
         passed verification and are to be invited, and that have failed veri-
         fication.  For  organization  accounts  in  the organization behavior
         graph, includes accounts that can be enabled and that cannot  be  en-
         abled.

       o The  accounts that CreateMembers was unable to process. This list in-
         cludes accounts that were already invited to be  member  accounts  in
         the behavior graph.

SYNOPSIS
            create-members
          --graph-arn <value>
          [--message <value>]
          [--disable-email-notification | --no-disable-email-notification]
          --accounts <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --graph-arn (string)
          The ARN of the behavior graph.

       --message (string)
          Customized  message  text to include in the invitation email message
          to the invited member accounts.

       --disable-email-notification |  --no-disable-email-notification  (bool-
       ean)
          if  set to true , then the invited accounts do not receive email no-
          tifications. By default, this is set to false , and the invited  ac-
          counts receive email notifications.

          Organization  accounts in the organization behavior graph do not re-
          ceive email notifications.

       --accounts (list)
          The list of Amazon Web Services accounts to invite or to enable. You
          can  invite  or enable up to 50 accounts at a time. For each invited
          account, the account list contains the account  identifier  and  the
          Amazon  Web  Services account root user email address. For organiza-
          tion accounts in the organization behavior graph, the email  address
          is not required.

          (structure)
              An Amazon Web Services account that is the administrator account
              of or a member of a behavior graph.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The account identifier of the Amazon Web Services account.

              EmailAddress -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account root user email  address  for
                 the Amazon Web Services account.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AccountId=string,EmailAddress=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "AccountId": "string",
              "EmailAddress": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To invite member accounts to a behavior graph

       The following create-members example invites two AWS accounts to become
       member     accounts    in    the    behavior    graph    arn:aws:detec-
       tive:us-east-1:111122223333:graph:123412341234. For each  account,  the
       request provides the AWS account ID and the account root user email ad-
       dress. The request includes a custom message to insert into the invita-
       tion email.

          aws detective create-members \
              --accounts AccountId=444455556666,EmailAddress=mmajor@example.com AccountId=123456789012,EmailAddress=jstiles@example.com \

OUTPUT
       Members -> (list)
          The set of member account invitation or enablement requests that De-
          tective was able to process. This includes accounts that  are  being
          verified, that failed verification, and that passed verification and
          are being sent an invitation or are being enabled.

          (structure)
              Details about a member account in a behavior graph.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account identifier for the member ac-
                 count.

              EmailAddress -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web Services account root user email address for
                 the member account.

              GraphArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the behavior graph.

              MasterId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account identifier of the administra-
                 tor account for the behavior graph.

              AdministratorId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account identifier of the administra-
                 tor account for the behavior graph.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current membership status of the member account. The sta-
                 tus can have one of the following values:

                 o INVITED  -  For  invited  accounts only. Indicates that the
                   member was sent an invitation but has not yet responded.

                 o VERIFICATION_IN_PROGRESS - For invited accounts only, indi-
                   cates  that Detective is verifying that the account identi-
                   fier and email address  provided  for  the  member  account
                   match.  If  they do match, then Detective sends the invita-
                   tion. If the email address  and  account  identifier  don't
                   match,  then  the  member  cannot  be added to the behavior
                   graph. For organization accounts in the organization behav-
                   ior  graph,  indicates that Detective is verifying that the
                   account belongs to the organization.

                 o VERIFICATION_FAILED - For invited accounts only.  Indicates
                   that  the account and email address provided for the member
                   account do not match, and Detective did not send an invita-
                   tion to the account.

                 o ENABLED  - Indicates that the member account currently con-
                   tributes data to the behavior graph. For invited  accounts,
                   the  member  account accepted the invitation. For organiza-
                   tion accounts in the organization behavior graph,  the  De-
                   tective  administrator account enabled the organization ac-
                   count as a member account.

                 o ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED - The account  accepted  the  invita-
                   tion,  or  was  enabled  by the Detective administrator ac-
                   count, but is prevented from contributing data to  the  be-
                   havior  graph.  DisabledReason  provides the reason why the
                   member account is not enabled.

                 Invited accounts that declined an invitation or that were re-
                 moved  from the behavior graph are not included. In the orga-
                 nization behavior graph, organization accounts that  the  De-
                 tective  administrator  account  did  not  enable are not in-
                 cluded.

              DisabledReason -> (string)
                 For member accounts with a status of ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED  ,
                 the reason that the member account is not enabled.

                 The reason can have one of the following values:

                 o VOLUME_TOO_HIGH  - Indicates that adding the member account
                   would cause the data volume for the behavior  graph  to  be
                   too high.

                 o VOLUME_UNKNOWN - Indicates that Detective is unable to ver-
                   ify the data volume for the member account. This is usually
                   because the member account is not enrolled in Amazon Guard-
                   Duty.

              InvitedTime -> (timestamp)
                 For invited accounts, the date and time that  Detective  sent
                 the  invitation  to the account. The value is an ISO8601 for-
                 matted string. For example, 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              UpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the member account was  last  updated.
                 The  value  is  an  ISO8601  formatted  string.  For example,
                 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              VolumeUsageInBytes -> (long)
                 The data volume in bytes per day for the member account.

              VolumeUsageUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The data and time when the member  account  data  volume  was
                 last  updated.  The value is an ISO8601 formatted string. For
                 example, 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              PercentOfGraphUtilization -> (double)
                 The member account data volume as a percentage of the maximum
                 allowed data volume. 0 indicates 0 percent, and 100 indicates
                 100 percent.

                 Note that this is not the percentage of  the  behavior  graph
                 data volume.

                 For  example, the data volume for the behavior graph is 80 GB
                 per day. The maximum data volume is 160 GB per  day.  If  the
                 data  volume  for  the  member account is 40 GB per day, then
                 PercentOfGraphUtilization is 25. It  represents  25%  of  the
                 maximum allowed data volume.

              PercentOfGraphUtilizationUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and time when the graph utilization percentage was
                 last updated. The value is an ISO8601 formatted  string.  For
                 example, 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              InvitationType -> (string)
                 The type of behavior graph membership.

                 For  an  organization  account  in  the organization behavior
                 graph, the type is ORGANIZATION .

                 For an account that was invited to a behavior graph, the type
                 is INVITATION .

       UnprocessedAccounts -> (list)
          The  list  of accounts for which Detective was unable to process the
          invitation or enablement request. For each account,  the  list  pro-
          vides  the  reason  why the request could not be processed. The list
          includes accounts that are already member accounts in  the  behavior
          graph.

          (structure)
              A  member  account  that was included in a request but for which
              the request could not be processed.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account identifier of the member  ac-
                 count that was not processed.

              Reason -> (string)
                 The  reason that the member account request could not be pro-
                 cessed.
