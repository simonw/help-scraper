NAME
       update-tracker -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the specified properties of a given tracker resource.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-tracker
          [--description <value>]
          [--position-filtering <value>]
          [--pricing-plan <value>]
          [--pricing-plan-data-source <value>]
          --tracker-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          Updates the description for the tracker resource.

       --position-filtering (string)
          Updates the position filtering for the tracker resource.

          Valid values:

          o TimeBased - Location updates are evaluated against linked geofence
            collections, but not every location update is stored. If your  up-
            date  frequency is more often than 30 seconds, only one update per
            30 seconds is stored for each unique device ID.

          o DistanceBased - If the device has moved less than 30 m (98.4  ft),
            location  updates  are  ignored. Location updates within this dis-
            tance are neither evaluated against linked  geofence  collections,
            nor stored. This helps control costs by reducing the number of ge-
            ofence evaluations and historical  device  positions  to  paginate
            through.  Distance-based  filtering can also reduce the effects of
            GPS noise when displaying device trajectories on a map.

          o AccuracyBased - If the device has moved less than the measured ac-
            curacy, location updates are ignored. For example, if two consecu-
            tive updates from a device have a horizontal accuracy of 5  m  and
            10  m,  the  second update is ignored if the device has moved less
            than 15 m. Ignored location updates are neither evaluated  against
            linked  geofence collections, nor stored. This helps educe the ef-
            fects of GPS noise when displaying device trajectories on  a  map,
            and  can  help  control  costs  by reducing the number of geofence
            evaluations.

          Possible values:

          o TimeBased

          o DistanceBased

          o AccuracyBased

       --pricing-plan (string)
          No longer used. If included, the only allowed value is  RequestBase-
          dUsage .

          Possible values:

          o RequestBasedUsage

          o MobileAssetTracking

          o MobileAssetManagement

       --pricing-plan-data-source (string)
          This parameter is no longer used.

       --tracker-name (string)
          The name of the tracker resource to update.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TrackerArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the updated tracker resource. Used
          to specify a resource across AWS.

          o Format   example:   arn:aws:geo:region:account-id:tracker/Example-
            Tracker

       TrackerName -> (string)
          The name of the updated tracker resource.

       UpdateTime -> (timestamp)
          The  timestamp for when the tracker resource was last updated in ISO
          8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ .
