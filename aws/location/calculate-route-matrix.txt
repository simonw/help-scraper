CALCULATE-ROUTE-MATRIX()                              CALCULATE-ROUTE-MATRIX()



NAME
       calculate-route-matrix -

DESCRIPTION
          Calculates  a  route matrix given the following required parameters:
          DeparturePositions and DestinationPositions  .  CalculateRouteMatrix
          calculates  routes  and  returns the travel time and travel distance
          from each departure position to each destination position in the re-
          quest.  For example, given departure positions A and B, and destina-
          tion positions X and Y, CalculateRouteMatrix will  return  time  and
          distance for routes from A to X, A to Y, B to X, and B to Y (in that
          order). The number of results returned (and routes calculated)  will
          be the number of DeparturePositions times the number of Destination-
          Positions .

       NOTE:
          Your account is charged for each route calculated, not the number of
          requests.

       Requires that you first create a route calculator resource .

       By  default,  a  request that doesn't specify a departure time uses the
       best time of day to travel with the best traffic conditions when calcu-
       lating routes.

       Additional options include:

       o Specifying a departure time using either DepartureTime or DepartNow .
         This calculates routes based on predictive traffic data at the  given
         time.

       NOTE:
          You  can't  specify both DepartureTime and DepartNow in a single re-
          quest. Specifying both parameters returns a validation error.

       o Specifying a travel mode using  TravelMode  sets  the  transportation
         mode  used  to calculate the routes. This also lets you specify addi-
         tional route preferences in CarModeOptions if traveling by Car  ,  or
         TruckModeOptions if traveling by Truck .

OPTIONS
       --calculator-name (string)
          The  name  of  the route calculator resource that you want to use to
          calculate the route matrix.

       --car-mode-options (structure)
          Specifies route preferences when traveling by Car , such as avoiding
          routes that use ferries or tolls.

          Requirements: TravelMode must be specified as Car .

          AvoidFerries -> (boolean)
              Avoids ferries when calculating routes.

              Default Value: false

              Valid Values: false | true

          AvoidTolls -> (boolean)
              Avoids tolls when calculating routes.

              Default Value: false

              Valid Values: false | true

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AvoidFerries=boolean,AvoidTolls=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AvoidFerries": true|false,
            "AvoidTolls": true|false
          }

       --depart-now | --no-depart-now (boolean)
          Sets  the  time  of  departure as the current time. Uses the current
          time to calculate the route matrix. You can't set both DepartureTime
          and  DepartNow  .  If neither is set, the best time of day to travel
          with the best traffic conditions is used to calculate the route  ma-
          trix.

          Default Value: false

          Valid Values: false | true

       --departure-positions (list)
          The  list  of  departure (origin) positions for the route matrix. An
          array of points, each of which is itself a 2-value array defined  in
          WGS  84  format:  [longitude,  latitude]  .  For example, [-123.115,
          49.285] .

          WARNING:
              Depending on the data provider selected in the route  calculator
              resource  there may be additional restrictions on the inputs you
              can choose. See Position restrictions  in  the  Amazon  Location
              Service Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              For route calculators that use Esri as the data provider, if you
              specify a departure that's not located on a road,  Amazon  Loca-
              tion  moves the position to the nearest road . The snapped value
              is available in the result in SnappedDeparturePositions .

          Valid Values: [-180 to 180,-90 to 90]

          (list)
              (double)

       --departure-time (timestamp)
          Specifies the desired time of departure. Uses the given time to cal-
          culate  the  route  matrix. You can't set both DepartureTime and De-
          partNow . If neither is set, the best time of day to travel with the
          best traffic conditions is used to calculate the route matrix.

          NOTE:
              Setting a departure time in the past returns a 400 ValidationEx-
              ception error.

       --destination-positions (list)
          The  list of destination positions for the route matrix. An array of
          points, each of which is itself a 2-value array defined  in  WGS  84
          format: [longitude, latitude] . For example, [-122.339, 47.615]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       SnappedDeparturePositions -> (list)
          For  routes  calculated using an Esri route calculator resource, de-

              is 0, all routes were calculated successfully.

          RouteCount -> (integer)
              The  count  of cells in the route matrix. Equal to the number of
