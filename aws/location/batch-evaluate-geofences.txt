BATCH-EVALUATE-GEOFENCES()                          BATCH-EVALUATE-GEOFENCES()



NAME
       batch-evaluate-geofences -

DESCRIPTION
       Evaluates device positions against the geofence geometries from a given
       geofence collection.

       This operation always returns an empty response because  geofences  are
       asynchronously  evaluated.  The evaluation determines if the device has
       entered or exited a geofenced area, and then publishes one of the  fol-
       lowing events to Amazon EventBridge:

       o ENTER  if  Amazon Location determines that the tracked device has en-
         tered a geofenced area.

       o EXIT if Amazon Location determines that the tracked device has exited
         a geofenced area.

       NOTE:
          The  last  geofence that a device was observed within is tracked for
          30 days after the most recent device position update.

       NOTE:
          Geofence evaluation uses the given device position. It does not  ac-
          count for the optional Accuracy of a DevicePositionUpdate .

SYNOPSIS
            batch-evaluate-geofences
          --collection-name <value>
          --device-position-updates <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --collection-name (string)
          The  geofence  collection used in evaluating the position of devices
          against its geofences.

       --device-position-updates (list)
          Contains device details for each device to be evaluated against  the
          given geofence collection.

          (structure)
              Contains the position update details for a device.

              Accuracy -> (structure)
                 The accuracy of the device position.

                 Horizontal -> (double)
                     Estimated  maximum  distance, in meters, between the mea-
                     sured position and the true position of a  device,  along
                     the Earth's surface.

              DeviceId -> (string)
                 The device associated to the position update.

              Position -> (list)
                 The  latest  device  position defined in WGS 84 format: [X or
                 longitude, Y or latitude] .

                 (double)

              PositionProperties -> (map)
                 Associates one of more properties with the position update. A
                 property  is a key-value pair stored with the position update
                 and added to any geofence event the update may trigger.

                 Format: "key" : "value"

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              SampleTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp at which the device's position was  determined.
                 Uses ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Accuracy={Horizontal=double},DeviceId=string,Position=double,double,PositionProperties={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},SampleTime=timestamp ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Accuracy": {
                "Horizontal": double
              },
              "DeviceId": "string",
              "Position": [double, ...],
              "PositionProperties": {"string": "string"
                ...},
              "SampleTime": timestamp
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Errors -> (list)
          Contains error details for each device that failed to  evaluate  its
          position against the given geofence collection.

          (structure)
              Contains  error  details for each device that failed to evaluate
              its position against the geofences in a given  geofence  collec-
              tion.

              DeviceId -> (string)
                 The device associated with the position evaluation error.

              Error -> (structure)
                 Contains details associated to the batch error.

                 Code -> (string)
                     The error code associated with the batch request error.

                 Message -> (string)
                     A message with the reason for the batch request error.

              SampleTime -> (timestamp)
                 Specifies a timestamp for when the error occurred in ISO 8601
                 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ
