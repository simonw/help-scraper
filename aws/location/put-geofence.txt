PUT-GEOFENCE()                                                  PUT-GEOFENCE()



NAME
       put-geofence -

DESCRIPTION
       Stores  a  geofence geometry in a given geofence collection, or updates
       the geometry of an existing geofence if a geofence ID  is  included  in
       the request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-geofence
          --collection-name <value>
          --geofence-id <value>
          --geometry <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --collection-name (string)
          The geofence collection to store the geofence in.

       --geofence-id (string)
          An identifier for the geofence. For example, ExampleGeofence-1 .

       --geometry (structure)
          Contains  the  polygon  details  to  specify the position of the ge-
          ofence.

          NOTE:
              Each geofence polygon can have a maximum of 1,000 vertices.

          Polygon -> (list)
              An array of 1 or more linear rings. A linear ring is an array of
              4 or more vertices, where the first and last vertex are the same
              to form a closed boundary. Each vertex is a 2-dimensional  point
              of the form: [longitude, latitude] .

              The first linear ring is an outer ring, describing the polygon's
              boundary. Subsequent linear rings may be inner or outer rings to
              describe holes and islands. Outer rings must list their vertices
              in counter-clockwise order around the ring's center,  where  the
              left side is the polygon's exterior. Inner rings must list their
              vertices in clockwise order, where the left side  is  the  poly-
              gon's interior.

              (list)
                 (list)
                     (double)

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Polygon": [
              [
                [double, ...]
                ...
              ]
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CreateTime -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp for when the geofence was created in ISO 8601  format:
          YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ

       GeofenceId -> (string)
          The geofence identifier entered in the request.

       UpdateTime -> (timestamp)
          The  timestamp  for  when  the geofence was last updated in ISO 8601
          format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ



                                                                PUT-GEOFENCE()
