GET-DEVICE-POSITION-HISTORY()                    GET-DEVICE-POSITION-HISTORY()



NAME
       get-device-position-history -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the device position history from a tracker resource within a
       specified range of time.

       NOTE:
          Device positions are deleted after 30 days.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-device-position-history is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: DevicePositions

SYNOPSIS
            get-device-position-history
          --device-id <value>
          [--end-time-exclusive <value>]
          [--start-time-inclusive <value>]
          --tracker-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --device-id (string)
          The device whose position history you want to retrieve.

       --end-time-exclusive (timestamp)
          Specify  the  end  time for the position history in ISO 8601 format:
          YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ . By default, the value will  be  the  time
          that the request is made.

          Requirement:

          o The time specified for EndTimeExclusive must be after the time for
            StartTimeInclusive .

       --start-time-inclusive (timestamp)
          Specify the start time for the position history in ISO 8601  format:
          YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ  .  By  default, the value will be 24 hours
          prior to the time that the request is made.

          Requirement:

          o The time specified for StartTimeInclusive must be before  EndTime-
            Exclusive .

       --tracker-name (string)
          The  tracker  resource receiving the request for the device position
          history.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DevicePositions -> (list)
          Contains the position history details for the requested device.

          (structure)
              Contains the device position details.

              Accuracy -> (structure)
                 The accuracy of the device position.

                 Horizontal -> (double)
                     Estimated maximum distance, in meters, between  the  mea-
                     sured  position  and the true position of a device, along
                     the Earth's surface.

              DeviceId -> (string)
                 The device whose position you retrieved.

              Position -> (list)
                 The last known device position.

                 (double)

              PositionProperties -> (map)
                 The properties associated with the position.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              ReceivedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp for when the tracker resource received the  de-
                 vice position in ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ .

              SampleTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp at which the device's position was determined.
                 Uses ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ .

       NextToken -> (string)
          A pagination token indicating there are additional pages  available.
          You  can  use the token in a following request to fetch the next set
          of results.
