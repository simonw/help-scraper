CALCULATE-ROUTE()                                            CALCULATE-ROUTE()



NAME
       calculate-route -

DESCRIPTION
          Calculates  a  route given the following required parameters: Depar-
          turePosition and  DestinationPosition  .  Requires  that  you  first
          create a route calculator resource .

       By  default,  a  request that doesn't specify a departure time uses the
       best time of day to travel with the best traffic conditions when calcu-
       lating the route.

       Additional options include:

       o Specifying a departure time using either DepartureTime or DepartNow .
         This calculates a route based on predictive traffic data at the given
         time.

       NOTE:
          You  can't  specify both DepartureTime and DepartNow in a single re-
          quest. Specifying both parameters returns a validation error.

       o Specifying a travel mode using  TravelMode  sets  the  transportation
         mode  used  to calculate the routes. This also lets you specify addi-
         tional route preferences in CarModeOptions if traveling by Car  ,  or
         TruckModeOptions if traveling by Truck .

            [[-122.757, 49.0021],[-122.349, 47.620]]

          NOTE:
              If you specify a waypoint position that's not located on a road,
              Amazon Location moves the position to the nearest road .

              Specifying more than 23 waypoints returns a 400 ValidationExcep-
              tion error.

              If  Esri is the provider for your route calculator, specifying a
              route that is longer than 400 km  returns  a  400  RoutesValida-
              tionException error.

          Valid Values: [-180 to 180,-90 to 90]

          (list)
              (double)

            [double, ...]
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       Legs -> (list)
          Contains details about each path between a  pair  of  positions  in-
          cluded along a route such as: StartPosition , EndPosition , Distance
          , DurationSeconds , Geometry , and Steps . The number  of  legs  re-
          turned  corresponds  to one fewer than the total number of positions
          in the request.

          For example, a route with a departure position and destination posi-
          tion returns one leg with the positions snapped to a nearby road :

          o The StartPosition is the departure position.

          o The EndPosition is the destination position.

          A  route with a waypoint between the departure and destination posi-
          tion returns two legs with the positions snapped to a nearby road:

          o Leg 1: The StartPosition is the departure position . The  EndPosi-
            tion is the waypoint positon.

          o Leg 2: The StartPosition is the waypoint position. The EndPosition
            is the destination position.

          (structure)
              Contains the calculated route's details for each path between  a
              pair  of  positions.  The number of legs returned corresponds to
              one fewer than the total number of positions in the request.

              For example, a route with a departure position  and  destination
              position  returns one leg with the positions snapped to a nearby
              road :

              o The StartPosition is the departure position.

              o The EndPosition is the destination position.

              A route with a waypoint between the  departure  and  destination
              position returns two legs with the positions snapped to a nearby
              road:

              o Leg 1: The StartPosition is the departure position . The  End-
                Position is the waypoint positon.

              o Leg  2: The StartPosition is the waypoint position. The EndPo-
                sition is the destination position.

              Distance -> (double)
                 The distance between the leg's StartPosition and  EndPosition
                 along a calculated route.

                 o The  default  measurement  is Kilometers unless the request
                   specifies a DistanceUnit of Miles .

              DurationSeconds -> (double)
                 The estimated travel time between the leg's StartPosition and
                 EndPosition  .  The  travel  mode and departure time that you
                 specify in the request determines the calculated time.

              EndPosition -> (list)
                 The terminating position of the leg. Follows the format [lon-
                 gitude,latitude] .

                 NOTE:
                     If  the EndPosition isn't located on a road, it's snapped
                     to a nearby road .

                 (double)

              Geometry -> (structure)
                 Contains the calculated route's path as a  linestring  geome-
                 try.

                 LineString -> (list)
                     An  ordered  list  of positions used to plot a route on a
                     map.

                     The first position is closest to the start  position  for
                     the  leg, and the last position is the closest to the end
                     position for the leg.

                     o For     example,     [[-123.117,     49.284],[-123.115,
                       49.285],[-123.115, 49.285]]

                     (list)
                        (double)

              StartPosition -> (list)
                 The  starting position of the leg. Follows the format [longi-
                 tude,latitude] .

                 NOTE:
                     If the  StartPosition  isn't  located  on  a  road,  it's
                     snapped to a nearby road .

                 (double)

              Steps -> (list)
                 Contains  a  list  of steps, which represent subsections of a
                 leg. Each step provides instructions for how to move  to  the
                 next  step  in the leg such as the step's start position, end
                 position, travel distance, travel duration, and geometry off-
                 set.

                 (structure)
                     Represents  an  element  of  a leg within a route. A step
                     contains instructions for how to move to the next step in
                     the leg.

                     Distance -> (double)
                        The  travel  distance between the step's StartPosition
                        and EndPosition .

                     DurationSeconds -> (double)
                        The estimated travel time, in seconds, from the step's
                        StartPosition  to  the EndPosition . . The travel mode
                        and departure time that you specify in the request de-
                        termines the calculated time.

                     EndPosition -> (list)
                        The  end  position of a step. If the position the last
                        step in the leg, this position is the same as the  end
                        position of the leg.

                        (double)

                     GeometryOffset -> (integer)
                        Represents the start position, or index, in a sequence
                        of steps within the leg's line  string  geometry.  For
                        example, the index of the first step in a leg geometry
                        is 0 .

                        Included in the response for queries that set Include-
                        LegGeometry to True .

                     StartPosition -> (list)
                        The  starting  position  of a step. If the position is
                        the first step in the leg, this position is  the  same
                        as the start position of the leg.

                        (double)

       Summary -> (structure)
          Contains  information  about  the  whole route, such as: RouteBBox ,
          DataSource , Distance , DistanceUnit , and DurationSeconds .

          DataSource -> (string)
              The data provider of traffic and road network data used to  cal-
              culate the route. Indicates one of the available providers:

              o Esri

              o Here

              For  more  information about data providers, see Amazon Location
              Service data providers .

          Distance -> (double)
              The total distance covered by the route. The sum of the distance
              travelled between every stop on the route.

              NOTE:
                 If  Esri  is  the  data  source for the route calculator, the
                 route distance cant be greater than 400 km. If the route  ex-
                 ceeds 400 km, the response is a 400 RoutesValidationException
                 error.

          DistanceUnit -> (string)
              The unit of measurement for route distances.

              of the travel time between every stop on the route.

          RouteBBox -> (list)
              Specifies  a  geographical box surrounding a route. Used to zoom
              into a route when displaying it in a map. For example,  [min  x,
              min y, max x, max y] .

              The first 2 bbox parameters describe the lower southwest corner:
