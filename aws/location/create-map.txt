NAME
       create-map -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a map resource in your AWS account, which provides map tiles of
       different styles sourced from global location data providers.

       NOTE:
          If your application is tracking or routing assets you  use  in  your
          business,  such  as delivery vehicles or employees, you may only use
          HERE as your geolocation provider. See section 82 of the AWS service
          terms for more details.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              Valid Esri map styles :

              o VectorEsriDarkGrayCanvas  The Esri Dark Gray Canvas map style.
                A  vector  basemap  with  a dark gray, neutral background with
                minimal colors, labels, and features that's designed  to  draw
                attention to your thematic content.

              o RasterEsriImagery   The  Esri  Imagery  map  style.  A  raster
                basemap that provides one meter or better satellite and aerial
                imagery in many parts of the world and lower resolution satel-
                lite imagery worldwide.

              o VectorEsriLightGrayCanvas  The  Esri  Light  Gray  Canvas  map
                style,  which  provides a detailed vector basemap with a light
                gray, neutral background style with  minimal  colors,  labels,
                and  features  that's  designed to draw attention to your the-
                matic content.

              o VectorEsriTopographic  The Esri Light map  style,  which  pro-
                vides a detailed vector basemap with a classic Esri map style.

              o VectorEsriStreets   The  Esri  World  Streets map style, which
                provides a detailed vector basemap for  the  world  symbolized
                with a classic Esri street map style. The vector tile layer is
                similar in content and style to the World  Street  Map  raster
                map.

              o VectorEsriNavigation   The  Esri  World  Navigation map style,
                which provides a detailed basemap  for  the  world  symbolized
                with  a  custom  navigation  map style that's designed for use
                during the day in mobile devices.

              Valid HERE Technologies map styles :

              o VectorHereBerlin  The HERE Berlin map style is a high contrast
                detailed  base  map of the world that blends 3D and 2D render-
                ing.

              NOTE:
                 When using HERE as your  data  provider,  and  selecting  the
                 Style  VectorHereBerlin  ,  you may not use HERE Technologies
                 maps for Asset Management. See the AWS Service Terms for Ama-

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Style=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Style": "string"
          }

       --description (string)
          An optional description for the map resource.

       --map-name (string)
          The name for the map resource.

          Requirements:

          o Must  contain  only  alphanumeric characters (AZ, az, 09), hyphens
            (-), periods (.), and underscores (_).

          o Must be a unique map resource name.

          o No spaces allowed. For example, ExampleMap .

       --pricing-plan (string)
          No longer used. If included, the only allowed value is  RequestBase-
          dUsage .

          Possible values:

          o RequestBasedUsage

          o MobileAssetTracking

          o MobileAssetManagement

       --tags (map)
          Applies  one  or more tags to the map resource. A tag is a key-value
          pair helps manage, identify, search, and filter  your  resources  by
          labelling them.

          Format: "key" : "value"

          Restrictions:

          o Maximum 50 tags per resource

          o Each resource tag must be unique with a maximum of one value.

          o Maximum key length: 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

          o Maximum value length: 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

          o Can  use  alphanumeric  characters (AZ, az, 09), and the following
            characters: + - = . _ : / @.

          o Cannot use "aws:" as a prefix for a key.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CreateTime -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp for when the map resource was created in ISO 8601 for-
          mat: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ .

       MapArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the map resource. Used to specify
          a resource across all AWS.

          o Format example: arn:aws:geo:region:account-id:maps/ExampleMap

       MapName -> (string)
          The name of the map resource.
