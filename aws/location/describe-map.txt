NAME
       describe-map -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the map resource details.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-map
          --map-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --map-name (string)
          The name of the map resource.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Configuration -> (structure)
          Specifies the map tile style selected from a partner data provider.

          Style -> (string)

              provider.

              Valid Esri map styles :

              o VectorEsriDarkGrayCanvas  The Esri Dark Gray Canvas map style.
                A  vector  basemap  with  a dark gray, neutral background with
                minimal colors, labels, and features that's designed  to  draw
                attention to your thematic content.

              o RasterEsriImagery   The  Esri  Imagery  map  style.  A  raster
                basemap that provides one meter or better satellite and aerial
                imagery in many parts of the world and lower resolution satel-
                lite imagery worldwide.

              o VectorEsriLightGrayCanvas  The  Esri  Light  Gray  Canvas  map
                style,  which  provides a detailed vector basemap with a light
                gray, neutral background style with  minimal  colors,  labels,
                and  features  that's  designed to draw attention to your the-
                matic content.

              o VectorEsriTopographic  The Esri Light map  style,  which  pro-
                vides a detailed vector basemap with a classic Esri map style.

              o VectorEsriStreets   The  Esri  World  Streets map style, which
