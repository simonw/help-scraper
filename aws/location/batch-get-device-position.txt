BATCH-GET-DEVICE-POSITION()                        BATCH-GET-DEVICE-POSITION()



NAME
       batch-get-device-position -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the latest device positions for requested devices.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-get-device-position
          --device-ids <value>
          --tracker-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --device-ids (list)
          Devices whose position you want to retrieve.

          o For  example, for two devices: device-ids=DeviceId1&device-ids=De-
            viceId2

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tracker-name (string)
          The tracker resource retrieving the device position.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DevicePositions -> (list)
          Contains  device  position  details such as the device ID, position,
          and timestamps for when the position was received and sampled.

          (structure)
              Contains the device position details.

              Accuracy -> (structure)
                 The accuracy of the device position.

                 Horizontal -> (double)
                     Estimated maximum distance, in meters, between  the  mea-
                     sured  position  and the true position of a device, along
                     the Earth's surface.

              DeviceId -> (string)
                 The device whose position you retrieved.

              Position -> (list)
                 The last known device position.

                 (double)

              PositionProperties -> (map)
                 The properties associated with the position.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              ReceivedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp for when the tracker resource received the  de-
                 vice position in ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ .

              SampleTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp at which the device's position was determined.
                 Uses ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ .

       Errors -> (list)
          Contains error details for each device that failed to send its posi-
          tion to the tracker resource.

          (structure)
              Contains  error details for each device that didn't return a po-
              sition.

              DeviceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the device that didn't return a position.

              Error -> (structure)
                 Contains details related to the error code.

                 Code -> (string)
                     The error code associated with the batch request error.

                 Message -> (string)
                     A message with the reason for the batch request error.
