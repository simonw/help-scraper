NAME
       create-place-index -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  place index resource in your AWS account. Use a place index
       resource to geocode addresses and  other  text  queries  by  using  the
       SearchPlaceIndexForText  operation,  and reverse geocode coordinates by
       using the SearchPlaceIndexForPosition operation, and enable autosugges-
       tions by using the SearchPlaceIndexForSuggestions operation.

       NOTE:
          If  your  application  is tracking or routing assets you use in your
          business, such as delivery vehicles or employees, you may  only  use
          HERE as your geolocation provider. See section 82 of the AWS service
          terms for more details.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       --data-source-configuration (structure)
          Specifies the data storage option requesting Places.

          IntendedUse -> (string)
              Specifies how the results of an operation will be stored by  the
              caller.

              Default value: SingleUse

       Shorthand Syntax:

          IntendedUse=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "IntendedUse": "SingleUse"|"Storage"
          }

       --description (string)
          The optional description for the place index resource.

       --index-name (string)
          The name of the place index resource.

          Requirements:

          o Contain only alphanumeric characters (AZ, az,  09),  hyphens  (-),
            periods (.), and underscores (_).

          o Must be a unique place index resource name.

          o No spaces allowed. For example, ExamplePlaceIndex .

       --pricing-plan (string)
          No  longer used. If included, the only allowed value is RequestBase-

       --tags (map)
          Applies one or more tags to the place index resource.  A  tag  is  a

          your resources.

          Format: "key" : "value"

          Restrictions:

          o Maximum 50 tags per resource.

          o Each tag key must be unique and must have exactly  one  associated
            value.

          o Maximum key length: 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

          o Maximum value length: 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          The  timestamp  for when the place index resource was created in ISO
          8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ .

       IndexArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the place index resource. Used to
          specify a resource across AWS.

            PlaceIndex

       IndexName -> (string)
          The name for the place index resource.
