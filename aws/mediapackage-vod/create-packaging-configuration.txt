OPTIONS
       --cmaf-package (structure) A CMAF packaging configuration.Encryption ->
       (structure)
              A CMAF encryption configuration.

              ConstantInitializationVector -> (string)
                 An optional 128-bit,  16-byte  hex  value  represented  by  a
                 32-character string, used in conjunction with the key for en-
                 crypting blocks. If you don't specify a  value,  then  Media-
                 Package creates the constant initialization vector (IV).

              SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                 A configuration for accessing an external Secure Packager and
                 Encoder Key Exchange (SPEKE) service that  will  provide  en-
                 cryption keys.

                 RoleArn -> (string)
                     An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that AWS El-
                     emental MediaPackage will assume when accessing  the  key
                     provider service.

                 SystemIds -> (list)
                     The system IDs to include in key requests.

                     (string)

                 Url -> (string)
                     The URL of the external key provider service.

          HlsManifests -> (list)
              A list of HLS manifest configurations.

              (structure)
                 An HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) manifest configuration.

                 AdMarkers -> (string)
                     This  setting controls how ad markers are included in the
                     packaged OriginEndpoint. "NONE" will omit all SCTE-35  ad
                     markers  from  the output. "PASSTHROUGH" causes the mani-
                     fest to contain a copy of the SCTE-35  ad  markers  (com-
                     ments)  taken directly from the input HTTP Live Streaming
                     (HLS) manifest. "SCTE35_ENHANCED"  generates  ad  markers
                     and  blackout tags based on SCTE-35 messages in the input
                     source.

                 IncludeIframeOnlyStream -> (boolean)
                     When enabled, an I-Frame only stream will be included  in
                     the output.

                 ManifestName -> (string)
                     An  optional  string  to include in the name of the mani-
                     fest.

                 ProgramDateTimeIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
                     The  interval  (in  seconds)  between   each   EXT-X-PRO-
                     GRAM-DATE-TIME tag inserted into manifests. Additionally,
                     when an interval is specified ID3Timed Metadata  messages
                     will  be  generated every 5 seconds using the ingest time
                     of the content. If the interval is not specified, or  set
                     to  0,  then  no EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags will be in-
                     serted into manifests and no ID3Timed  Metadata  messages
                     will be generated. Note that irrespective of this parame-
                     ter, if any ID3 Timed Metadata  is  found  in  HTTP  Live
                     Streaming  (HLS)  input, it will be passed through to HLS
                     output.

                 RepeatExtXKey -> (boolean)
                     When enabled, the EXT-X-KEY tag will be repeated in  out-
                     put manifests.

                 StreamSelection -> (structure)
                     A StreamSelection configuration.

                     MaxVideoBitsPerSecond -> (integer)
                        The maximum video bitrate (bps) to include in output.

                     MinVideoBitsPerSecond -> (integer)
                        The minimum video bitrate (bps) to include in output.

                     StreamOrder -> (string)
                        A  directive  that  determines the order of streams in
                        the output.

          IncludeEncoderConfigurationInSegments -> (boolean)
              When includeEncoderConfigurationInSegments is set to true, Medi-
              aPackage  places  your  encoder's  Sequence Parameter Set (SPS),
              Picture Parameter Set (PPS), and Video Parameter Set (VPS) meta-
              data  in  every  video  segment instead of in the init fragment.
              This lets you use different SPS/PPS/VPS settings for your assets
              during content playback.

          SegmentDurationSeconds -> (integer)
              Duration (in seconds) of each fragment. Actual fragments will be
              rounded to the nearest multiple of the source fragment duration.

EXAMPLES
       To create a packaging configuration

       The following create-packaging-configuration example creates a  packag-
       ing   configuration   named   new_hls  in  the  packaging  group  named
       hls_chicken. This example uses a file on disk named hls_pc.json to pro-
       vide the details.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The ARN of the PackagingConfiguration.

       CmafPackage -> (structure)
          A CMAF packaging configuration.

          Encryption -> (structure)
              A CMAF encryption configuration.

              ConstantInitializationVector -> (string)
                 An optional 128-bit,  16-byte  hex  value  represented  by  a
                 32-character string, used in conjunction with the key for en-
                 crypting blocks. If you don't specify a  value,  then  Media-
                 Package creates the constant initialization vector (IV).

              SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                 A configuration for accessing an external Secure Packager and
                 Encoder Key Exchange (SPEKE) service that  will  provide  en-
                 cryption keys.

                 RoleArn -> (string)
                     An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that AWS El-
                     emental MediaPackage will assume when accessing  the  key
                     provider service.

                 SystemIds -> (list)
                     The system IDs to include in key requests.

                     This  setting controls how ad markers are included in the
                     packaged OriginEndpoint. "NONE" will omit all SCTE-35  ad
                     markers  from  the output. "PASSTHROUGH" causes the mani-
                     fest to contain a copy of the SCTE-35  ad  markers  (com-
                     ments)  taken directly from the input HTTP Live Streaming
                     (HLS) manifest. "SCTE35_ENHANCED"  generates  ad  markers

                 ManifestName -> (string)
                     An  optional  string  to include in the name of the mani-
                     fest.

                 ProgramDateTimeIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
                     The  interval  (in  seconds)  between   each   EXT-X-PRO-
                     GRAM-DATE-TIME tag inserted into manifests. Additionally,
                     when an interval is specified ID3Timed Metadata  messages
                     will  be  generated every 5 seconds using the ingest time
                     of the content. If the interval is not specified, or  set
                     to  0,  then  no EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags will be in-
                     serted into manifests and no ID3Timed  Metadata  messages
                     will be generated. Note that irrespective of this parame-
                     ter, if any ID3 Timed Metadata  is  found  in  HTTP  Live
                     Streaming  (HLS)  input, it will be passed through to HLS
                     output.

                 RepeatExtXKey -> (boolean)
                     When enabled, the EXT-X-KEY tag will be repeated in  out-
                     put manifests.

                     ments  are  combined  and  presented at the AdaptationSet
                     level.

                 ManifestName -> (string)
                     An optional string to include in the name  of  the  mani-
                     fest.
