NAME
       describe-packaging-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a description of a MediaPackage VOD PackagingConfiguration re-
       source.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-packaging-configuration
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string) The ID of a MediaPackage VOD  PackagingConfiguration  re-
       source.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe a packaging configuration

       The  following describe-packaging-configuration example displays all of
       the details of the packaging configuration named DASH.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The ARN of the PackagingConfiguration.

       CmafPackage -> (structure)
          A CMAF packaging configuration.

          Encryption -> (structure)
              A CMAF encryption configuration.

              ConstantInitializationVector -> (string)
                 An  optional  128-bit,  16-byte  hex  value  represented by a
                 32-character string, used in conjunction with the key for en-
                 crypting  blocks.  If  you don't specify a value, then Media-
                 Package creates the constant initialization vector (IV).

              SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                 A configuration for accessing an external Secure Packager and
                 Encoder  Key  Exchange  (SPEKE) service that will provide en-
                 cryption keys.

                 RoleArn -> (string)
                     An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that AWS El-
                     emental  MediaPackage  will assume when accessing the key
                     provider service.

                 SystemIds -> (list)
                     The system IDs to include in key requests.

                     (string)

                 Url -> (string)
                     The URL of the external key provider service.

          HlsManifests -> (list)
              A list of HLS manifest configurations.

              (structure)
                 An HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) manifest configuration.

                 AdMarkers -> (string)
                     This setting controls how ad markers are included in  the
                     packaged  OriginEndpoint. "NONE" will omit all SCTE-35 ad
                     markers from the output. "PASSTHROUGH" causes  the  mani-
                     fest  to  contain  a copy of the SCTE-35 ad markers (com-
                     ments) taken directly from the input HTTP Live  Streaming
                     (HLS)  manifest.  "SCTE35_ENHANCED"  generates ad markers
                     and blackout tags based on SCTE-35 messages in the  input
                     source.

                 IncludeIframeOnlyStream -> (boolean)
                     When  enabled, an I-Frame only stream will be included in
                     the output.

                 ManifestName -> (string)
                     An optional string to include in the name  of  the  mani-
                     fest.

                 ProgramDateTimeIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
                     The   interval   (in  seconds)  between  each  EXT-X-PRO-
                     GRAM-DATE-TIME tag inserted into manifests. Additionally,
                     when  an interval is specified ID3Timed Metadata messages
                     will be generated every 5 seconds using the  ingest  time
                     of  the content. If the interval is not specified, or set
                     to 0, then no EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags  will  be  in-
                     serted  into  manifests and no ID3Timed Metadata messages
                     will be generated. Note that irrespective of this parame-
                     ter,  if  any  ID3  Timed  Metadata is found in HTTP Live
                     Streaming (HLS) input, it will be passed through  to  HLS
                     output.

                 RepeatExtXKey -> (boolean)
                     When  enabled, the EXT-X-KEY tag will be repeated in out-
                     put manifests.

                 StreamSelection -> (structure)

                        The minimum video bitrate (bps) to include in output.

                     StreamOrder -> (string)

              data in every video segment instead of  in  the  init  fragment.
              This lets you use different SPS/PPS/VPS settings for your assets
              during content playback.

          SegmentDurationSeconds -> (integer)
              Duration (in seconds) of each fragment. Actual fragments will be

                     An  optional  string  to include in the name of the mani-
                     fest.

                 MinBufferTimeSeconds -> (integer)
                     Minimum duration (in seconds) that a player  will  buffer
                     media before starting the presentation.

                 Profile -> (string)
                     The  Dynamic  Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) profile
                     type. When set to "HBBTV_1_5", HbbTV 1.5 compliant output

                     The  source  of  scte markers used. When set to SEGMENTS,
                     the scte markers are sourced from the segments of the in-
                     gested  content.  When  set to MANIFEST, the scte markers
