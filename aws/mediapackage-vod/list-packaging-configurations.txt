NAME
       list-packaging-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  collection  of  MediaPackage VOD PackagingConfiguration re-
       sources.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-packaging-configurations is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: PackagingConfigurations

SYNOPSIS
            list-packaging-configurations
          [--packaging-group-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --packaging-group-id (string) Returns MediaPackage VOD PackagingConfig-
       urations associated with the specified PackagingGroup.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list all packaging configurations

       The following list-packaging-configurations example lists  all  of  the
       packaging  configurations  that  are  configured on the packaging group
       named Packaging_group_1.

          aws mediapackage-vod list-packaging-configurations \
              --packaging-group-id Packaging_group_1

                        AdMarkers -> (string)
                            This setting controls how ad markers are  included
                            in  the  packaged OriginEndpoint. "NONE" will omit
                            all  SCTE-35   ad   markers   from   the   output.
                            "PASSTHROUGH"  causes  the  manifest  to contain a
                            copy of the SCTE-35 ad  markers  (comments)  taken
                            directly  from the input HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)
                            manifest. "SCTE35_ENHANCED" generates  ad  markers
                            and blackout tags based on SCTE-35 messages in the
                            input source.

                        IncludeIframeOnlyStream -> (boolean)
                            When enabled, an I-Frame only stream will  be  in-
                            cluded in the output.

                        ManifestName -> (string)
                            An  optional  string to include in the name of the
                            manifest.

                        ProgramDateTimeIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
                            The interval (in seconds) between each  EXT-X-PRO-
                            GRAM-DATE-TIME  tag inserted into manifests. Addi-
                            tionally, when an interval is  specified  ID3Timed
                            Metadata  messages  will be generated every 5 sec-
                            onds using the ingest time of the content. If  the
                            interval  is  not  specified, or set to 0, then no
                            EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags will be inserted into
                            manifests  and  no ID3Timed Metadata messages will
                            be generated. Note that irrespective of  this  pa-
                            rameter,  if  any  ID3  Timed Metadata is found in
                            HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) input, it will be passed
                            through to HLS output.

                        RepeatExtXKey -> (boolean)
                            When  enabled,  the EXT-X-KEY tag will be repeated
                            in output manifests.

                        StreamSelection -> (structure)
                            A StreamSelection configuration.

                            MaxVideoBitsPerSecond -> (integer)
                               The maximum video bitrate (bps) to  include  in
                               output.

                            MinVideoBitsPerSecond -> (integer)
                               The  minimum  video bitrate (bps) to include in
                               output.

                            StreamOrder -> (string)
                               A  directive  that  determines  the  order   of
                               streams in the output.

                 IncludeEncoderConfigurationInSegments -> (boolean)
                     When   includeEncoderConfigurationInSegments  is  set  to
                     true, MediaPackage places your encoder's Sequence Parame-
                     ter Set (SPS), Picture Parameter Set (PPS), and Video Pa-
                     rameter Set (VPS) metadata in every video segment instead
                     of  in  the  init  fragment.  This lets you use different
                     SPS/PPS/VPS settings for your assets during content play-
                     back.

                 SegmentDurationSeconds -> (integer)
                     Duration  (in seconds) of each fragment. Actual fragments
                     will be rounded to the nearest  multiple  of  the  source
                     fragment duration.

              DashPackage -> (structure)
                 A  Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) packaging con-
                 figuration.

                 DashManifests -> (list)
                     A list of DASH manifest configurations.

                     (structure)
                        A DASH manifest configuration.

                        ManifestLayout -> (string)
                            Determines the position of some tags in the  Media
                            Presentation  Description (MPD). When set to FULL,
                            elements like SegmentTemplate  and  ContentProtec-
                            tion are included in each Representation. When set
                            to COMPACT, duplicate elements  are  combined  and
