OPTIONS
       --configuration-set-name (string) ConfigurationSetName

       --event-destination  (structure)  An object that defines a single event
       destination.CloudWatchLogsDestination -> (structure)
              An object that contains information about an  event  destination
              that sends data to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

              IamRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon Identity and Ac-
                 cess Management (IAM) role that is able to write  event  data
                 to an Amazon CloudWatch destination.

              LogGroupArn -> (string)
                 The  name of the Amazon CloudWatch Log Group that you want to
                 record events in.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether or not the event destination  is  enabled.  If
              the event destination is enabled, then Amazon Pinpoint sends re-
              sponse data to the specified event destination.

          KinesisFirehoseDestination -> (structure)
              An object that contains information about an  event  destination
              that sends data to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.

              DeliveryStreamArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that can write
                 data to an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose stream.

              IamRoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  Amazon  Kinesis  Data
                 Firehose destination that you want to use in the event desti-
                 nation.

          MatchingEventTypes -> (list)
              An array of EventDestination objects. Each EventDestination  ob-
              ject  includes  ARNs  and other information that define an event
              destination.

              (string)
                 The types of events that are sent to the event destination.

              An object that contains information about an  event  destination
              that sends data to Amazon SNS.

              TopicArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic that
                 you want to publish events to.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CloudWatchLogsDestination={IamRoleArn=string,LogGroupArn=string},Enabled=boolean,KinesisFirehoseDestination={DeliveryStreamArn=string,IamRoleArn=string},MatchingEventTypes=string,string,SnsDestination={TopicArn=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CloudWatchLogsDestination": {
              "IamRoleArn": "string",
              "LogGroupArn": "string"
            },
            "Enabled": true|false,
            "KinesisFirehoseDestination": {
              "DeliveryStreamArn": "string",
              "IamRoleArn": "string"
            },
            "MatchingEventTypes": ["INITIATED_CALL"|"RINGING"|"ANSWERED"|"COMPLETED_CALL"|"BUSY"|"FAILED"|"NO_ANSWER", ...],
            "SnsDestination": {
              "TopicArn": "string"
            }
          }

       --event-destination-name (string) A name that identifies the event des-
       tination.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
