NAME
       get-configuration-set-event-destinations -

DESCRIPTION
       Obtain  information  about an event destination, including the types of
       events it reports, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  destination,
       and the name of the event destination.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-configuration-set-event-destinations
          --configuration-set-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --configuration-set-name (string) ConfigurationSetName

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EventDestinations -> (list)
          An  array  of EventDestination objects. Each EventDestination object
          includes ARNs and other information that define  an  event  destina-
          tion.

              An object that defines an event destination.

              CloudWatchLogsDestination -> (structure)
                 An  object  that contains information about an event destina-
                 tion that sends data to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

                 IamRoleArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon Identity  and

                 response data to the specified event destination.

              KinesisFirehoseDestination -> (structure)
                 An  object  that contains information about an event destina-
                 tion that sends data to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.

                 DeliveryStreamArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM  role  that  can
                     write data to an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose stream.

                 IamRoleArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Kinesis Data
                     Firehose destination that you want to use  in  the  event
                     destination.

              MatchingEventTypes -> (list)
                 An  array  of EventDestination objects. Each EventDestination
                 object includes ARNs and other  information  that  define  an
                 event destination.

                 (string)
                     The  types  of events that are sent to the event destina-
                     tion.
