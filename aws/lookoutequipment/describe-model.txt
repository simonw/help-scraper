DESCRIBE-MODEL()                                              DESCRIBE-MODEL()



NAME
       describe-model -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  a JSON containing the overall information about a specific ML
       model, including model name and ARN, dataset, training  and  evaluation
       information, status, and so on.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-model
          --model-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --model-name (string)
          The name of the ML model to be described.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          The  Amazon  Resouce Name (ARN) of the dataset used to create the ML
          model being described.

       Schema -> (string)
          A JSON description of the data that is in each time series  dataset,
          including names, column names, and data types.

       LabelsInputConfiguration -> (structure)
          Specifies  configuration information about the labels input, includ-
          ing its S3 location.

          S3InputConfiguration -> (structure)
              Contains location information for the S3 location being used for
              label data.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The name of the S3 bucket holding the label data.

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The prefix for the S3 bucket used for the label data.

       TrainingDataStartTime -> (timestamp)
          Indicates  the  time reference in the dataset that was used to begin
          the subset of training data for the ML model.

       TrainingDataEndTime -> (timestamp)
          Indicates the time reference in the dataset that was used to end the
          subset of training data for the ML model.

       EvaluationDataStartTime -> (timestamp)
          Indicates  the  time reference in the dataset that was used to begin
          the subset of evaluation data for the ML model.

       EvaluationDataEndTime -> (timestamp)
          Indicates the time reference in the dataset that was used to end the
          subset of evaluation data for the ML model.

       RoleArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of a role with permission to access
          the data source for the ML model being described.

       DataPreProcessingConfiguration -> (structure)
          The configuration is the TargetSamplingRate , which is the  sampling
          rate  of the data after post processing by Amazon Lookout for Equip-
          ment. For example, if you provide data that has been collected at  a
          1  second  level and you want the system to resample the data at a 1
          minute rate before training, the TargetSamplingRate is 1 minute.

          When providing a value for the TargetSamplingRate , you must  attach
          the  prefix "PT" to the rate you want. The value for a 1 second rate
          is therefore PT1S , the value for a 15 minute rate is  PT15M  ,  and
          the value for a 1 hour rate is PT1H

          TargetSamplingRate -> (string)
              The  sampling  rate  of the data after post processing by Amazon
              Lookout for Equipment. For example, if you provide data that has
              been  collected  at  a 1 second level and you want the system to
              resample the data at a 1 minute rate before training,  the  Tar-
              getSamplingRate is 1 minute.

              When providing a value for the TargetSamplingRate , you must at-
              tach the prefix "PT" to the rate you want. The  value  for  a  1
              second  rate  is therefore PT1S , the value for a 15 minute rate
              is PT15M , and the value for a 1 hour rate is PT1H

       Status -> (string)
          Specifies the current status of the model  being  described.  Status
          describes the status of the most recent action of the model.

       TrainingExecutionStartTime -> (timestamp)
          Indicates the time at which the training of the ML model began.

       TrainingExecutionEndTime -> (timestamp)
          Indicates  the  time  at which the training of the ML model was com-
          pleted.

       FailedReason -> (string)
          If the training of the ML model failed, this  indicates  the  reason
          for that failure.

       ModelMetrics -> (string)
          The  Model Metrics show an aggregated summary of the model's perfor-
          mance within the evaluation time range. This is the JSON content  of
          the metrics created when evaluating the model.

       LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
          Indicates the last time the ML model was updated. The type of update
          is not specified.

       CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
          Indicates the time and date at which the ML model was created.

       ServerSideKmsKeyId -> (string)
          Provides the identifier of the KMS key used to encrypt model data by
          Amazon Lookout for Equipment.

       OffCondition -> (string)
          Indicates  that  the asset associated with this sensor has been shut
          off. As long as this condition is met, Lookout  for  Equipment  will
          not use data from this asset for training, evaluation, or inference.
