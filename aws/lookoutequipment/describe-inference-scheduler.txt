NAME
       describe-inference-scheduler -

DESCRIPTION
       Specifies information about the inference scheduler being used, includ-
       ing name, model, status, and associated metadata

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-inference-scheduler
          --inference-scheduler-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --inference-scheduler-name (string)
          The name of the inference scheduler being described.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ModelArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of the ML model of the inference
          scheduler being described.

       ModelName -> (string)
          The name of the ML model of the inference scheduler being described.

       InferenceSchedulerName -> (string)
          The name of the inference scheduler being described.

       InferenceSchedulerArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the inference scheduler being  de-
          scribed.

       Status -> (string)
          Indicates the status of the inference scheduler.

       DataDelayOffsetInMinutes -> (long)
          A  period of time (in minutes) by which inference on the data is de-
          layed after the data starts. For instance, if you select  an  offset
          delay time of five minutes, inference will not begin on the data un-
          til the first data measurement after the five minute mark. For exam-
          ple,  if five minutes is selected, the inference scheduler will wake
          up at the configured frequency with the additional five minute delay
          time  to  check the customer S3 bucket. The customer can upload data
          at the same frequency and they don't need to stop  and  restart  the
          scheduler when uploading new data.

       DataUploadFrequency -> (string)
          Specifies how often data is uploaded to the source S3 bucket for the
          input data. This value is the length of time between  data  uploads.
          For  instance, if you select 5 minutes, Amazon Lookout for Equipment
          will upload the real-time data to the source  bucket  once  every  5
          minutes. This frequency also determines how often Amazon Lookout for
          Equipment starts a scheduled inference on your data. In  this  exam-
          ple, it starts once every 5 minutes.

       CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
          Specifies the time at which the inference scheduler was created.

       UpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
          Specifies  the  time  at  which the inference scheduler was last up-
          dated, if it was.

       DataInputConfiguration -> (structure)
          Specifies configuration information for the input data for  the  in-
          ference  scheduler,  including  delimiter, format, and dataset loca-
          tion.

          S3InputConfiguration -> (structure)
              Specifies configuration information for the input data  for  the
              inference, including Amazon S3 location of input data.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The bucket containing the input dataset for the inference.

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The  prefix for the S3 bucket used for the input data for the
                 inference.

          InputTimeZoneOffset -> (string)
              Indicates the difference between your time zone and  Coordinated
              Universal Time (UTC).

          InferenceInputNameConfiguration -> (structure)
              Specifies  configuration  information for the input data for the
              inference, including timestamp format and delimiter.

              TimestampFormat -> (string)
                 The format of the timestamp, whether Epoch time, or standard,
                 with or without hyphens (-).

              ComponentTimestampDelimiter -> (string)
                 Indicates  the  delimiter character used between items in the
                 data.

       DataOutputConfiguration -> (structure)
          Specifies information for  the  output  results  for  the  inference
          scheduler, including the output S3 location.

          S3OutputConfiguration -> (structure)
              Specifies  configuration information for the output results from
              for the inference, output S3 location.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The bucket containing the output results from the inference

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The prefix for the S3 bucket used for the output results from
                 the inference.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              The  ID number for the AWS KMS key used to encrypt the inference
              output.

       RoleArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a role with permission  to  access
          the data source for the inference scheduler being described.

       ServerSideKmsKeyId -> (string)
          Provides  the  identifier  of  the KMS key used to encrypt inference
          scheduler data by Amazon Lookout for Equipment.
