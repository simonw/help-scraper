OPTIONS
       --attributes  (structure) The attributes that you want to assign to the
       media stream.Fmtp -> (structure)
              The settings that you want to use to define the media stream.

              ChannelOrder -> (string)
                 The format of the audio channel.

              Colorimetry -> (string)
                 The format that is used for the representation of color.

              ExactFramerate -> (string)
                 The frame rate for the video stream,  in  frames/second.  For
                 example: 60000/1001. If you specify a whole number, MediaCon-
                 nect uses a ratio of N/1. For example, if you specify 60, Me-
                 diaConnect uses 60/1 as the exactFramerate.

              Par -> (string)
                 The pixel aspect ratio (PAR) of the video.

              Range -> (string)
                 The encoding range of the video.

              ScanMode -> (string)
                 The  type  of  compression that was used to smooth the videos
                 appearance.

              Tcs -> (string)
                 The transfer characteristic system (TCS) that is used in  the
                 video.

          Lang -> (string)
              The  audio  language,  in a format that is recognized by the re-
              ceiver.

       Shorthand Syntax:

       JSON Syntax:

            "Fmtp": {
              "ChannelOrder": "string",
              "Colorimetry": "BT601"|"BT709"|"BT2020"|"BT2100"|"ST2065-1"|"ST2065-3"|"XYZ",
              "ExactFramerate": "string",

            },
            "Lang": "string"
          }

       --clock-rate (integer) The sample rate (in Hz) for the stream.  If  the
       media  stream type is video or ancillary data, set this value to 90000.
       If the media stream type is audio, set this value to  either  48000  or
       96000.

       --description (string) Description

       --flow-arn (string) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the flow.

       --media-stream-name (string) The name of the media stream that you want
       to update.

       --media-stream-type (string) The type of media stream.
          Possible values:

          o video

          o audio

          o ancillary-data

       --video-format (string) The resolution of the video.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          The media stream that you updated.

          Attributes -> (structure)
              Attributes that are related to the media stream.

              Fmtp -> (structure)
                 A set of parameters that define the media stream.

                 ChannelOrder -> (string)

                     For  example:  60000/1001. If you specify a whole number,
                     MediaConnect uses a ratio of N/1.  For  example,  if  you
                     specify 60, MediaConnect uses 60/1 as the exactFramerate.

                 Par -> (string)
                     The pixel aspect ratio (PAR) of the video.

                 ScanMode -> (string)

                     the video.

              Lang -> (string)
                 The audio language, in a format that is recognized by the re-
                 ceiver.

          ClockRate -> (integer)
              The sample rate for the stream. This value is measured in Hz.

          Description -> (string)
              A description that can help you quickly identify what your media
              stream is used for.

          Fmt -> (integer)
              The  format  type  number  (sometimes referred to as RTP payload
              type) of the media stream. MediaConnect assigns  this  value  to
              the  media stream. For ST 2110 JPEG XS outputs, you need to pro-
              vide this value to the receiver.
