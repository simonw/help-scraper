NAME
       describe-flow -

DESCRIPTION
       Displays  the  details  of  a flow. The response includes the flow ARN,
       name, and Availability Zone, as well as details about the source,  out-
       puts, and entitlements.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-flow
          --flow-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --flow-arn (string) The ARN of the flow that you want to describe.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     ConstantInitializationVector -> (string)
                        A 128-bit, 16-byte hex value represented by a 32-char-
                        acter string, to be used with the key  for  encrypting
                        content.  This  parameter  is not valid for static key

                        with your digital rights management (DRM) platform key
                        provider. This parameter is required for SPEKE encryp-
                        tion and is not valid for static key encryption.

                     KeyType -> (string)
                        The type of key that is used for the encryption. If no
                        keyType is provided, the service will use the  default
                        setting (static-key).

                     Region -> (string)
                        The AWS Region that the API Gateway proxy endpoint was

                        cryption and is not valid for static key encryption.

                     ResourceId -> (string)
                        An  identifier for the content. The service sends this
                        value to the key server to identify the  current  end-
                        point.  The  resource  ID is also known as the content
                        ID. This parameter is required  for  SPEKE  encryption
                        and is not valid for static key encryption.

                     RoleArn -> (string)
                        The  ARN  of  the  role  that you created during setup
                        (when you set  up  AWS  Elemental  MediaConnect  as  a
                        trusted entity).

                     SecretArn -> (string)
                        The  ARN of the secret that you created in AWS Secrets
                        Manager to store the encryption key. This parameter is
                        required  for  static  key encryption and is not valid

                        talk  to  your  key server. This parameter is required
                        for SPEKE encryption and is not valid for  static  key
                        encryption.

                 EntitlementArn -> (string)
                     The ARN of the entitlement.

                     The  AWS  account IDs that you want to share your content
                     with. The receiving accounts (subscribers)  will  be  al-
                     lowed  to create their own flow using your content as the
                     source.

                     (string)

          FlowArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN), a unique identifier for any  AWS
              resource, of the flow.

          MediaStreams -> (list)
              The  media  streams that are associated with the flow. After you
              associate a media stream with a source, you can  also  associate
              it with outputs on the flow.

              (structure)
                 A single track or stream of media that contains video, audio,
                 or ancillary data. After you add a media stream  to  a  flow,
                 you  can  associate it with sources and outputs on that flow,
                 as long as they use the CDI protocol or the ST 2110  JPEG  XS
                 protocol.  Each  source  or output can consist of one or many
                 media streams.

                 Attributes -> (structure)
                     Attributes that are related to the media stream.

                     Fmtp -> (structure)
                        A set of parameters that define the media stream.

                        ChannelOrder -> (string)
                            The format of the audio channel.

                            The format that is used for the representation  of
                            color.

                        ExactFramerate -> (string)
                            The   frame   rate   for   the  video  stream,  in
                            frames/second. For  example:  60000/1001.  If  you
                            specify  a whole number, MediaConnect uses a ratio
                            of N/1. For example, if you specify 60,  MediaCon-
                            nect uses 60/1 as the exactFramerate.

                        Par -> (string)
                            The pixel aspect ratio (PAR) of the video.

                        Tcs -> (string)
                            The transfer characteristic system (TCS)  that  is
                            used in the video.

                     Lang -> (string)
                        The  audio language, in a format that is recognized by
                        the receiver.

                 ClockRate -> (integer)
                     The sample rate for the stream. This value is measured in
                     Hz.

                 Description -> (string)
                     A  description  that  can  help you quickly identify what
                     your media stream is used for.

                 Fmt -> (integer)
                     The format type number (sometimes referred to as RTP pay-
                     load type) of the media stream. MediaConnect assigns this
                     value to the media stream. For ST 2110 JPEG  XS  outputs,
                     you need to provide this value to the receiver.

                 MediaStreamId -> (integer)
                     A unique identifier for the media stream.

                 MediaStreamName -> (string)
                     A  name  that helps you distinguish one media stream from

                     billed to the subscriber.

                 Description -> (string)
                     A description of the output.

                 Destination -> (string)
                     The address where you want to send the output.

                 Encryption -> (structure)
                     The type of key used for the encryption. If no keyType is
                     provided,  the  service  will  use  the  default  setting
                     (static-key).

                     Algorithm -> (string)
                        The  type of algorithm that is used for the encryption
                        (such as aes128, aes192, or aes256).

                     ConstantInitializationVector -> (string)
                        A 128-bit, 16-byte hex value represented by a 32-char-

                        encryption.

                     DeviceId -> (string)
                        The  value  of  one of the devices that you configured
                        with your digital rights management (DRM) platform key
                        provider. This parameter is required for SPEKE encryp-
                        tion and is not valid for static key encryption.

                     KeyType -> (string)
                        The type of key that is used for the encryption. If no
