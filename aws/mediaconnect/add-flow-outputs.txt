       --outputs (list) A list of outputs that you want to add.(structure)
          The output that you want to add to this flow.

          CidrAllowList -> (list)
              The range of IP addresses that should  be  allowed  to  initiate
              output  requests  to  this flow. These IP addresses should be in
              the form of a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)  block;  for
              example, 10.0.0.0/16.

              (string)

          Description -> (string)
              A  description  of  the output. This description appears only on
              the AWS Elemental MediaConnect console and will not be  seen  by
              the end user.

          Destination -> (string)
              The  IP address from which video will be sent to output destina-
              tions.

          Encryption -> (structure)
              The type of key used for the encryption. If no keyType  is  pro-
              vided,  the  service  will use the default setting (static-key).
              Allowable encryption types: static-key.

              Algorithm -> (string)
                 The type of algorithm that is used for the  encryption  (such
                 as aes128, aes192, or aes256).

              ConstantInitializationVector -> (string)
                 A  128-bit,  16-byte  hex value represented by a 32-character
                 string, to be used with the key for encrypting content.  This
                 parameter is not valid for static key encryption.

              DeviceId -> (string)
                 The value of one of the devices that you configured with your
                 digital rights management (DRM) platform key  provider.  This
                 parameter  is  required for SPEKE encryption and is not valid
                 for static key encryption.

              KeyType -> (string)
                 The type of key that is used for the encryption. If  no  key-
                 Type  is  provided,  the service will use the default setting
                 (static-key).

              Region -> (string)
                 The AWS Region that the API Gateway proxy endpoint  was  cre-
                 ated  in. This parameter is required for SPEKE encryption and
                 is not valid for static key encryption.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 An identifier for the content. The service sends  this  value
                 to  the  key server to identify the current endpoint. The re-
                 source ID is also known as the content ID. This parameter  is
                 required for SPEKE encryption and is not valid for static key
                 encryption.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the role that you created during setup  (when  you
                 set up AWS Elemental MediaConnect as a trusted entity).

              SecretArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the secret that you created in AWS Secrets Manager
                 to store the encryption key. This parameter is  required  for
                 static key encryption and is not valid for SPEKE encryption.

              Url -> (string)
                 The URL from the API Gateway proxy that you set up to talk to
                 your key server. This parameter is required for SPEKE encryp-
                 tion and is not valid for static key encryption.

          MaxLatency -> (integer)
              The maximum latency in milliseconds. This parameter applies only
              to RIST-based, Zixi-based, and Fujitsu-based streams.

                 EncodingName -> (string)
                     The  format that will be used to encode the data. For an-
                     cillary data streams, set the encoding name to  smpte291.
                     For  audio  streams,  set  the  encoding name to pcm. For
                     video, 2110 streams, set the encoding name  to  raw.  For
                     video, JPEG XS streams, set the encoding name to jxsv.

                 EncodingParameters -> (structure)
                     A  collection  of parameters that determine how MediaCon-
                     nect will convert the content. These fields only apply to
                     outputs on flows that have a CDI source.

                     CompressionFactor -> (double)
                        A  value  that is used to calculate compression for an
                        output. The bitrate of the  output  is  calculated  as
                        follows:  Output  bitrate  = (1 / compressionFactor) *
                        (source bitrate) This property only applies to outputs
                        that  use  the  ST  2110 JPEG XS protocol, with a flow
                        source that uses the CDI protocol.  Valid  values  are
                        floating  point  numbers  in the range of 3.0 to 10.0,
                        inclusive.

                     EncoderProfile -> (string)
                        A setting on the encoder that drives compression  set-
                        tings.  This  property  only  applies  to  video media
                        streams associated with outputs that use the  ST  2110
                        JPEG  XS  protocol, if at least one source on the flow
                        uses the CDI protocol.

                 MediaStreamName -> (string)
                     The name of the media stream that is associated with  the
                     output.

          MinLatency -> (integer)
              The  minimum  latency  in milliseconds for SRT-based streams. In
              streams that use the SRT protocol, this value that  you  set  on
              your MediaConnect source or output represents the minimal poten-
              tial latency of that connection. The latency of  the  stream  is
              set  to  the  highest number between the senders minimum latency
              and the receivers minimum latency.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the output. This value must  be  unique  within  the
              current flow.

          Port -> (integer)
              The port to use when content is distributed to this output.

          Protocol -> (string)
              The protocol to use for the output.

          RemoteId -> (string)
              The remote ID for the Zixi-pull output stream.

          SenderControlPort -> (integer)
              The  port that the flow uses to send outbound requests to initi-
              ate connection with the sender.

          SmoothingLatency -> (integer)
              The smoothing latency in milliseconds for RIST, RTP, and RTP-FEC
              streams.

          StreamId -> (string)
              The  stream ID that you want to use for this transport. This pa-
              rameter applies only to Zixi and SRT caller-based streams.

          VpcInterfaceAttachment -> (structure)
              The name of the VPC interface attachment to use for this output.

              VpcInterfaceName -> (string)

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
