LIST-OFFERINGS()                                              LIST-OFFERINGS()



NAME
       list-offerings -

DESCRIPTION
       Displays  a list of all offerings that are available to this account in
       the current AWS Region. If you have an active reservation (which  means
       you've  purchased  an  offering that has already started and hasn't ex-
       pired yet), your account isn't eligible for other offerings.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-offerings is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Offerings

SYNOPSIS
            list-offerings
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token  that  identifies which batch of results that you want to
          see. For example, you submit a ListOfferings request with MaxResults
          set  at  5. The service returns the first batch of results (up to 5)
          and a NextToken value. To see the next batch  of  results,  you  can
          submit the ListOfferings request a second time and specify the Next-
          Token value.

       Offerings -> (list)
          A list of offerings that are available to this account in  the  cur-
          rent AWS Region.

          (structure)
              A  savings plan that reserves a certain amount of outbound band-
              width usage at a discounted rate each month  over  a  period  of
              time.

              CurrencyCode -> (string)
                 The  type of currency that is used for billing. The currency-
                 Code used for all reservations is US dollars.

              Duration -> (integer)
                 The length of time that your reservation would be active.

              DurationUnits -> (string)
                 The unit of measurement for the duration of the offering.

              OfferingArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that MediaConnect  assigns  to
                 the offering.

              OfferingDescription -> (string)
                 A description of the offering.

              PricePerUnit -> (string)
                 The  cost  of  a single unit. This value, in combination with
                 priceUnits, makes up the rate.

              PriceUnits -> (string)
                 The unit of measurement that is used for billing. This value,
                 in combination with pricePerUnit, makes up the rate.

              ResourceSpecification -> (structure)
                 A  definition  of  the  amount of outbound bandwidth that you
                 would be reserving if you purchase the offering.

                 ReservedBitrate -> (integer)
                     The amount of outbound bandwidth that  is  discounted  in
                     the offering.

                 ResourceType -> (string)
                     The  type  of  resource and the unit that is being billed
                     for.
