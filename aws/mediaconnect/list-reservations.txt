LIST-RESERVATIONS()                                        LIST-RESERVATIONS()



NAME
       list-reservations -

DESCRIPTION
       Displays  a  list  of all reservations that have been purchased by this
       account in the current AWS Region. This list includes all  reservations
       in all states (such as active and expired).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-reservations  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Reservations

SYNOPSIS
            list-reservations
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token  that  identifies which batch of results that you want to
          see. For example, you submit a ListReservations request with  MaxRe-
          sults  set  at 5. The service returns the first batch of results (up
          to 5) and a NextToken value. To see the next batch of  results,  you
          can  submit  the  ListReservations request a second time and specify
          the NextToken value.

       Reservations -> (list)
          A list of all reservations that have been purchased by this  account
          in the current AWS Region.

          (structure)
              A  pricing  agreement  for a discounted rate for a specific out-
              bound bandwidth that your MediaConnect  account  will  use  each
              month  over  a  specific time period. The discounted rate in the
              reservation applies to outbound bandwidth  for  all  flows  from
              your  account until your account reaches the amount of bandwidth
              in your reservation. If you use more outbound bandwidth than the
              agreed  upon amount in a single month, the overage is charged at
              the on-demand rate.

              CurrencyCode -> (string)
                 The type of currency that is used for billing. The  currency-
                 Code used for your reservation is US dollars.

              Duration -> (integer)
                 The length of time that this reservation is active. MediaCon-
                 nect defines this value in the offering.

              DurationUnits -> (string)
                 The unit of measurement for the duration of the  reservation.
                 MediaConnect defines this value in the offering.

              End -> (string)
                 The day and time that this reservation expires. This value is
                 calculated based on the start date and time that you set  and
                 the offering's duration.

              OfferingArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that MediaConnect assigns to
                 the offering.

              OfferingDescription -> (string)
                 A description of  the  offering.  MediaConnect  defines  this
                 value in the offering.

              PricePerUnit -> (string)
                 The  cost  of  a single unit. This value, in combination with
                 priceUnits, makes up  the  rate.  MediaConnect  defines  this
                 value in the offering.

              PriceUnits -> (string)
                 The unit of measurement that is used for billing. This value,
                 in combination with pricePerUnit, makes up the  rate.  Media-
                 Connect defines this value in the offering.

              ReservationArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that MediaConnect assigns to
                 the reservation when you purchase an offering.

              ReservationName -> (string)
                 The name that you assigned to the reservation when  you  pur-
                 chased the offering.

              ReservationState -> (string)
                 The status of your reservation.

              ResourceSpecification -> (structure)
                 A  definition  of  the  amount of outbound bandwidth that you
                 would be reserving if you purchase the offering. MediaConnect
                 defines  the values that make up the resourceSpecification in
                 the offering.

                 ReservedBitrate -> (integer)
                     The amount of outbound bandwidth that  is  discounted  in
                     the offering.

                 ResourceType -> (string)
                     The  type  of  resource and the unit that is being billed
                     for.

              Start -> (string)
                 The day and time that the reservation becomes active. You set
                 this value when you purchase the offering.
