       lowed to initiate output requests to  this  flow.  These  IP  addresses
       should be in the form of a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block;
       for example, 10.0.0.0/16.(string)

       Syntax:

       seen by the end user.

       --destination (string) The IP address where you want to send  the  out-
       put.

       --encryption (structure) The type of key used for the encryption. If no

       (static-key).Algorithm -> (string)
              The  type  of algorithm that is used for the encryption (such as
              aes128, aes192, or aes256).

              string, to be used with the key for encrypting content. This pa-
              rameter is not valid for static key encryption.

          DeviceId -> (string)
              The value of one of the devices that you  configured  with  your
              digital  rights management (DRM) platform key provider. This pa-

              static key encryption.

          KeyType -> (string)
              The  type  of key that is used for the encryption. If no keyType

              valid for static key encryption.

          ResourceId -> (string)
              An  identifier  for the content. The service sends this value to
              the key server to identify the current endpoint. The resource ID

              SPEKE encryption and is not valid for static key encryption.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the role that you created during setup (when you  set
              up AWS Elemental MediaConnect as a trusted entity).

       with to initiate connection with the sender.

       --smoothing-latency (integer) The smoothing latency in milliseconds for
       RIST, RTP, and RTP-FEC streams.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command

       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                        follows: Output bitrate = (1  /  compressionFactor)  *
                        (source bitrate) This property only applies to outputs
                        that use the ST 2110 JPEG XS  protocol,  with  a  flow
                        source  that  uses  the CDI protocol. Valid values are
                        floating point numbers in the range of  3.0  to  10.0,
                        inclusive.
