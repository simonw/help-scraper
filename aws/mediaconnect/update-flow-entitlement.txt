NAME
       update-flow-entitlement -

DESCRIPTION
       You  can  change an entitlement's description, subscribers, and encryp-
       tion. If you change the subscribers, the service will remove  the  out-
       puts that are are used by the subscribers that are removed.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-flow-entitlement
          [--description <value>]
          [--encryption <value>]
          --entitlement-arn <value>
          [--entitlement-status <value>]
          --flow-arn <value>
          [--subscribers <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --description  (string) A description of the entitlement. This descrip-
       tion appears only on the AWS Elemental MediaConnect  console  and  will
       not be seen by the subscriber or end user.

       --encryption  (structure)  The  type of encryption that will be used on
       the output associated with this entitlement.Algorithm -> (string)
              The type of algorithm that is used for the encryption  (such  as
              aes128, aes192, or aes256).

          ConstantInitializationVector -> (string)
              A  128-bit,  16-byte  hex  value  represented  by a 32-character
              string, to be used with the key for encrypting content. This pa-
              rameter is not valid for static key encryption.

          DeviceId -> (string)
              The  value  of  one of the devices that you configured with your
              digital rights management (DRM) platform key provider. This  pa-
              rameter  is  required  for SPEKE encryption and is not valid for
              static key encryption.

          KeyType -> (string)
              The type of key that is used for the encryption. If  no  keyType
              is   provided,   the   service  will  use  the  default  setting
              (static-key).

          Region -> (string)
              The AWS Region that the API Gateway proxy endpoint  was  created
              in.  This  parameter is required for SPEKE encryption and is not
              valid for static key encryption.

          ResourceId -> (string)
              An identifier for the content. The service sends this  value  to
              the key server to identify the current endpoint. The resource ID
              is also known as the content ID. This parameter is required  for
              SPEKE encryption and is not valid for static key encryption.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The  ARN of the role that you created during setup (when you set
              up AWS Elemental MediaConnect as a trusted entity).

          SecretArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the secret that you created in AWS Secrets Manager to
              store  the encryption key. This parameter is required for static
              key encryption and is not valid for SPEKE encryption.

          Url -> (string)
              The URL from the API Gateway proxy that you set up  to  talk  to
              your key server. This parameter is required for SPEKE encryption
              and is not valid for static key encryption.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Algorithm=string,ConstantInitializationVector=string,DeviceId=string,KeyType=string,Region=string,ResourceId=string,RoleArn=string,SecretArn=string,Url=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Algorithm": "aes128"|"aes192"|"aes256",
            "ConstantInitializationVector": "string",
            "DeviceId": "string",
            "KeyType": "speke"|"static-key"|"srt-password",
            "Region": "string",
            "ResourceId": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string",
            "SecretArn": "string",
            "Url": "string"
          }

       --entitlement-arn (string) The ARN of the entitlement that you want  to
       update.

       --entitlement-status  (string) An indication of whether you want to en-
       able the entitlement to allow access, or disable it to  stop  streaming
       content  to  the  subscribers flow temporarily. If you dont specify the
       entitlementStatus field in your request, MediaConnect leaves the  value
       unchanged.
          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

          o DISABLED

       --flow-arn  (string)  The  flow that is associated with the entitlement
       that you want to update.

       --subscribers (list) The AWS account IDs that you want  to  share  your
       content  with.  The receiving accounts (subscribers) will be allowed to
       create their own flow using your content as the source.(string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
