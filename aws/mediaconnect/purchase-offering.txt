SYNOPSIS
            purchase-offering
          --offering-arn <value>
          --reservation-name <value>
          --start <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --offering-arn (string) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the offering.

       --reservation-name (string) The name that  you  want  to  use  for  the
       reservation.

       --start (string) The date and time that you want the reservation to be-
       gin, in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). You can specify any date  and
       time  between 12:00am on the first day of the current month to the cur-
       rent time on today's date, inclusive. Specify the start  in  a  24-hour
       notation. Use the following format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:SSZ, where T and Z
       are literal characters. For example, to specify  11:30pm  on  March  5,
       2020, enter 2020-03-05T23:30:00Z.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Reservation -> (structure)
          A  pricing  agreement  for a discounted rate for a specific outbound
          bandwidth that your MediaConnect account will use each month over  a
          specific time period. The discounted rate in the reservation applies
          to outbound bandwidth for all flows from your account until your ac-
          count  reaches  the  amount of bandwidth in your reservation. If you
          use more outbound bandwidth than the agreed upon amount in a  single
          month, the overage is charged at the on-demand rate.

          CurrencyCode -> (string)

              used for your reservation is US dollars.

              The cost of a single  unit.  This  value,  in  combination  with
              priceUnits,  makes  up the rate. MediaConnect defines this value
              in the offering.

          PriceUnits -> (string)
              The unit of measurement that is used for billing. This value, in

              A definition of the amount of outbound bandwidth that you  would
              be  reserving if you purchase the offering. MediaConnect defines
              the values that make up the resourceSpecification in the  offer-
