ADD-FLOW-MEDIA-STREAMS()                              ADD-FLOW-MEDIA-STREAMS()



NAME
       add-flow-media-streams -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds media streams to an existing flow. After you add a media stream to
       a flow, you can associate it with a source and/or an output  that  uses
       the ST 2110 JPEG XS or CDI protocol.

OPTIONS
       --flow-arn (string) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the flow.

       --media-streams  (list)  The  media streams that you want to add to the
       flow.(structure)
          The media stream that you want to add to the flow.

          Attributes -> (structure)
              The attributes that you want to assign to the new media stream.

              Fmtp -> (structure)
                 The settings that you want to use to define the media stream.

                 ChannelOrder -> (string)
                     The format of the audio channel.

                 Colorimetry -> (string)
                     The format that is used for the representation of color.

                 ExactFramerate -> (string)
                     The frame rate for the video  stream,  in  frames/second.
                     For  example:  60000/1001. If you specify a whole number,
                     MediaConnect uses a ratio of N/1.  For  example,  if  you
                     specify 60, MediaConnect uses 60/1 as the exactFramerate.

                 Par -> (string)
                     The pixel aspect ratio (PAR) of the video.

                 Range -> (string)
                     The encoding range of the video.

                 ScanMode -> (string)

                 Tcs -> (string)
                     The transfer characteristic system (TCS) that is used  in

              The sample rate (in Hz) for the stream. If the media stream type
              is  video or ancillary data, set this value to 90000. If the me-
              dia stream type is audio, set this  value  to  either  48000  or
              96000.

          Description -> (string)
              A description that can help you quickly identify what your media

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,

                     Colorimetry -> (string)
                        The  format  that  is  used  for the representation of

                     ExactFramerate -> (string)
                        The frame rate for the video stream, in frames/second.
                        For  example:  60000/1001. If you specify a whole num-
                        ber, MediaConnect uses a ratio of N/1. For example, if
                        you  specify  60, MediaConnect uses 60/1 as the exact-
                        Framerate.

                        in the video.

                 Lang -> (string)
                     The audio language, in a format that is recognized by the
                     receiver.

              ClockRate -> (integer)
                 The sample rate for the stream. This value is measured in Hz.

              Description -> (string)
