SYNOPSIS
            describe-reservation
          --reservation-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --reservation-arn (string) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the reser-
       vation.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Reservation -> (structure)
          A pricing agreement for a discounted rate for  a  specific  outbound
          bandwidth  that your MediaConnect account will use each month over a
          specific time period. The discounted rate in the reservation applies
          to outbound bandwidth for all flows from your account until your ac-
          count reaches the amount of bandwidth in your  reservation.  If  you
          use  more outbound bandwidth than the agreed upon amount in a single
          month, the overage is charged at the on-demand rate.

          CurrencyCode -> (string)

              used for your reservation is US dollars.
