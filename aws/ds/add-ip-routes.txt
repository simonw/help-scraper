ADD-IP-ROUTES()                                                ADD-IP-ROUTES()



NAME
       add-ip-routes -

DESCRIPTION
       If the DNS server for your self-managed domain uses a publicly address-
       able IP address, you must add a CIDR address block to  correctly  route
       traffic  to  and  from  your  Microsoft  AD on Amazon Web Services. Ad-
       dIpRoutes adds this address block. You can also use AddIpRoutes to  fa-
       cilitate routing traffic that uses public IP ranges from your Microsoft
       AD on Amazon Web Services to a peer VPC.

       Before you call AddIpRoutes , ensure that all of the  required  permis-
       sions  have been explicitly granted through a policy. For details about
       what permissions are required to run  the  AddIpRoutes  operation,  see
       Directory  Service  API Permissions: Actions, Resources, and Conditions
       Reference .

SYNOPSIS
            add-ip-routes
          --directory-id <value>
          --ip-routes <value>
          [--update-security-group-for-directory-controllers | --no-update-security-group-for-directory-controllers]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          Identifier (ID) of the directory to which to add the address block.

       --ip-routes (list)
          IP address blocks, using CIDR format, of the traffic to route.  This
          is  often  the  IP  address  block  of  the DNS server used for your
          self-managed domain.

          (structure)
              IP address block. This is often the address  block  of  the  DNS
              server used for your self-managed domain.

              CidrIp -> (string)
                 IP  address block using CIDR format, for example 10.0.0.0/24.
                 This is often the address block of the DNS  server  used  for
                 your  self-managed domain. For a single IP address use a CIDR
                 address block with /32. For example 10.0.0.0/32.

              Description -> (string)
                 Description of the address block.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CidrIp=string,Description=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "CidrIp": "string",
              "Description": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --update-security-group-for-directory-controllers  |  --no-update-secu-
       rity-group-for-directory-controllers (boolean)
          If  set to true, updates the inbound and outbound rules of the secu-
          rity group that has the description: "Amazon  Web  Services  created
          security  group  for  directory ID directory controllers." Following
          are the new rules:

          These security rules impact an internal network  interface  that  is
          not exposed publicly.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
