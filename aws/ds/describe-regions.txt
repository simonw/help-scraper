DESCRIBE-REGIONS()                                          DESCRIBE-REGIONS()



NAME
       describe-regions -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides   information  about  the  Regions  that  are  configured  for
       multi-Region replication.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-regions
          --directory-id <value>
          [--region-name <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          The identifier of the directory.

       --region-name (string)
          The name of the Region. For example, us-east-1 .

       --next-token (string)
          The DescribeRegionsResult.NextToken value from a  previous  call  to
          DescribeRegions . Pass null if this is the first call.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RegionsDescription -> (list)
          List of Region information related to the directory for each  repli-
          cated Region.

          (structure)

              DirectoryId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the directory.

              RegionName -> (string)
                 The name of the Region. For example, us-east-1 .

              RegionType -> (string)
                 Specifies  whether the Region is the primary Region or an ad-
                 ditional Region.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the replication process for the  specified  Re-
                 gion.

              VpcSettings -> (structure)
                 Contains  VPC  information  for the  CreateDirectory or  Cre-
                 ateMicrosoftAD operation.

                 VpcId -> (string)
                     The identifier of the VPC in which to create  the  direc-
                     tory.

                 SubnetIds -> (list)
                     The identifiers of the subnets for the directory servers.
                     The two subnets must be in different Availability  Zones.
                     Directory  Service  creates  a directory server and a DNS
                     server in each of these subnets.

                     (string)

              DesiredNumberOfDomainControllers -> (integer)
                 The desired number of domain controllers in the specified Re-
                 gion for the specified directory.

              LaunchTime -> (timestamp)
                 Specifies when the Region replication began.

              StatusLastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the Region status was last updated.

              LastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time that the Region description was last up-
                 dated.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If not null, more results are available. Pass  this  value  for  the
          NextToken  parameter in a subsequent call to  DescribeRegions to re-
          trieve the next set of items.
