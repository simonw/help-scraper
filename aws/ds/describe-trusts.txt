DESCRIBE-TRUSTS()                                            DESCRIBE-TRUSTS()



NAME
       describe-trusts -

DESCRIPTION
       Obtains information about the trust relationships for this account.

       If  no  input parameters are provided, such as DirectoryId or TrustIds,
       this request describes all the trust relationships belonging to the ac-
       count.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-trusts is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Trusts

SYNOPSIS
            describe-trusts
          [--directory-id <value>]
          [--trust-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          The Directory ID of the Amazon Web Services directory that is a part
          of the requested trust relationship.

       --trust-ids (list)
          A list of identifiers of the trust relationships for which to obtain
          the information. If this member is  null,  all  trust  relationships
          that belong to the current account are returned.

          An empty list results in an InvalidParameterException being thrown.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get details about your trust relationships

       The  following describe-trusts example displays details about the trust
       relationships for the specified directory.

          aws ds describe-trusts \
             --directory-id d-a1b2c3d4e5

       Output:

          are less than the requested number of items left to retrieve, or  if
          the limitations of the operation have been exceeded.
