LIST-IP-ROUTES()                                              LIST-IP-ROUTES()



NAME
       list-ip-routes -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the address blocks that you have added to a directory.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-ip-routes  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: IpRoutesInfo

SYNOPSIS
            list-ip-routes
          --directory-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          Identifier (ID) of the directory for which you want to retrieve  the
          IP addresses.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       IpRoutesInfo -> (list)
          A list of  IpRoute s.

          (structure)
              Information about one or more IP address blocks.

              DirectoryId -> (string)
                 Identifier (ID) of the directory associated with the  IP  ad-
                 dresses.

              CidrIp -> (string)
                 IP address block in the  IpRoute .

              IpRouteStatusMsg -> (string)
                 The status of the IP address block.

              AddedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and time the address block was added to the direc-
                 tory.

              IpRouteStatusReason -> (string)
                 The reason for the IpRouteStatusMsg.

              Description -> (string)
                 Description of the  IpRouteInfo .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If not null, more results are available. Pass  this  value  for  the
          NextToken  parameter  in  a  subsequent call to  ListIpRoutes to re-
          trieve the next set of items.
