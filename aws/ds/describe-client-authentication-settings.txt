DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about the type of client authentication for the
       specified directory, if the type is specified. If no type is specified,
       information  about  all  client authentication types that are supported
       for the specified directory is retrieved. Currently, only SmartCard  is
       supported.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-client-authentication-settings
          --directory-id <value>
          [--type <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          The identifier of the directory for which to retrieve information.

       --type (string)
          The type of client authentication for which to retrieve information.
          If no type is specified, a list of all client  authentication  types
          that are supported for the specified directory is retrieved.

          Possible values:

          o SmartCard

          o SmartCardOrPassword

       --next-token (string)
          The  DescribeClientAuthenticationSettingsResult.NextToken value from
          a previous call to  DescribeClientAuthenticationSettings . Pass null
          if this is the first call.

       --limit (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of items to return. If this value is zero, the
          maximum number of items is specified by the limitations of the oper-
          ation.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 The  type  of  client authentication for the specified direc-
                 tory. If no type is specified, a list of all client authenti-

                 The  date  and time when the status of the client authentica-
                 tion type was last updated.

       NextToken -> (string)
