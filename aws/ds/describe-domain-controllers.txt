NAME
       describe-domain-controllers -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides information about any domain controllers in your directory.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-domain-controllers  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: DomainControllers

SYNOPSIS
            describe-domain-controllers
          --directory-id <value>
          [--domain-controller-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          Identifier of the directory for which to retrieve  the  domain  con-
          troller information.

       --domain-controller-ids (list)
          A  list  of identifiers for the domain controllers whose information
          will be provided.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DomainControllers -> (list)
          List of the  DomainController objects that were retrieved.

          (structure)
              Contains  information  about the domain controllers for a speci-
              fied directory.

              DirectoryId -> (string)
                 Identifier of the directory where the domain  controller  re-
                 sides.

              DomainControllerId -> (string)
                 Identifies a specific domain controller in the directory.

              DnsIpAddr -> (string)
                 The IP address of the domain controller.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  of  the  VPC  that  contains the domain con-
                 troller.

              SubnetId -> (string)
                 Identifier of the subnet in the VPC that contains the  domain
                 controller.

              AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                 The Availability Zone where the domain controller is located.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the domain controller.

              StatusReason -> (string)
                 A description of the domain controller state.

              LaunchTime -> (timestamp)
                 Specifies when the domain controller was created.

              StatusLastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the status was last updated.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  not  null,  more  results are available. Pass this value for the
          NextToken parameter in  a  subsequent  call  to   DescribeDomainCon-
          trollers retrieve the next set of items.
