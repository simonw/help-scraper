NAME
       describe-shared-directories -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the shared directories in your account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-shared-directories  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: SharedDirectories

SYNOPSIS
            describe-shared-directories
          --owner-directory-id <value>
          [--shared-directory-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --owner-directory-id (string)
          Returns the identifier of the directory in the directory  owner  ac-
          count.

       --shared-directory-ids (list)
          A list of identifiers of all shared directories in your account.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SharedDirectories -> (list)
          A list of all shared directories in your account.

          (structure)
              Details  about  the  shared directory in the directory owner ac-
              count for which the share request in the directory consumer  ac-
              count has been accepted.

              OwnerAccountId -> (string)
                 Identifier of the directory owner account, which contains the
                 directory that has been shared to the consumer account.

              OwnerDirectoryId -> (string)
                 Identifier of the directory in the directory owner account.

              ShareMethod -> (string)
                 The method used when sharing a directory to determine whether
                 the  directory  should  be shared within your Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices organization (ORGANIZATIONS ) or with  any  Amazon  Web
                 Services account by sending a shared directory request (HAND-
                 SHAKE ).

              SharedAccountId -> (string)
                 Identifier of the directory consumer account that has  access
                 to  the shared directory (OwnerDirectoryId ) in the directory
                 owner account.

              SharedDirectoryId -> (string)
                 Identifier of the shared directory in the directory  consumer
                 account.  This  identifier  is  different  for each directory
                 owner account.

              ShareStatus -> (string)
                 Current directory status of the shared Managed  Microsoft  AD
                 directory.

              ShareNotes -> (string)
                 A directory share request that is sent by the directory owner
                 to the directory consumer. The request includes a typed  mes-
                 sage  to  help the directory consumer administrator determine
                 whether to approve or reject the share invitation.

              CreatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the shared directory was created.

              LastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the shared directory was last updated.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If not null, token that indicates that more results  are  available.
          Pass  this value for the NextToken parameter in a subsequent call to
          DescribeSharedDirectories to retrieve the next set of items.
