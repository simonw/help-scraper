DESCRIBE-EXPORT-TASKS()                                DESCRIBE-EXPORT-TASKS()



NAME
       describe-export-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve  status of one or more export tasks. You can retrieve the sta-
       tus of up to 100 export tasks.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-export-tasks is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: exportsInfo

SYNOPSIS
            describe-export-tasks
          [--export-ids <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --export-ids (list)
          One or more unique identifiers used to query the status of an export
          request.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters.

          o AgentId - ID of the agent whose collected data will be exported

          (structure)
              Used to select which agent's data is to be  exported.  A  single
              agent  ID  may  be selected for export using the StartExportTask
              action.

              name -> (string)
                 A single ExportFilter name. Supported filters: agentId .

              values -> (list)
                 A single agentId for a Discovery Agent.  An  agentId  can  be
                 found using the DescribeAgents action. Typically an ADS agen-
                 tId is in the form o-0123456789abcdef0 .

                 (string)

              condition -> (string)
                 Supported condition: EQUALS

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string,condition=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...],
              "condition": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       exportsInfo -> (list)
          Contains one or more sets of export request details. When the status
          of  a request is SUCCEEDED , the response includes a URL for an Ama-
          zon S3 bucket where you can view the data in a CSV file.

          (structure)
              Information regarding the export status of discovered data.  The
              value is an array of objects.

              exportId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier used to query an export.

              exportStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the data export job.

              statusMessage -> (string)
                 A status message provided for API callers.

              configurationsDownloadUrl -> (string)
                 A  URL  for  an Amazon S3 bucket where you can review the ex-
                 ported data. The URL is displayed only  if  the  export  suc-
                 ceeded.

              exportRequestTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the data export was initiated.

              isTruncated -> (boolean)
                 If  true,  the  export of agent information exceeded the size
                 limit for a single export and the exported data is incomplete
                 for  the  requested  time  range.  To  address this, select a
                 smaller time range for the export by using startDate and end-
                 Date .

              requestedStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  value  of startTime parameter in the StartExportTask re-
                 quest. If no startTime was requested, this  result  does  not
                 appear in ExportInfo .

              requestedEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  endTime  used in the StartExportTask request. If no end-
                 Time was requested, this result does not appear in ExportInfo
                 .

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  nextToken  value to include in a future DescribeExportTasks re-
          quest. When the results  of  a  DescribeExportTasks  request  exceed
          maxResults , this value can be used to retrieve the next page of re-
          sults. This value is null when there are no more results to return.
