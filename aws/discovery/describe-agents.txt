DESCRIBE-AGENTS()                                            DESCRIBE-AGENTS()



NAME
       describe-agents -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  agents  or  connectors  as specified by ID or other filters. All
       agents/connectors associated with your user account can  be  listed  if
       you call DescribeAgents as is without passing any parameters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-agents is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: agentsInfo

SYNOPSIS
            describe-agents
          [--agent-ids <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --agent-ids (list)
          The agent or the Connector IDs for which you  want  information.  If
          you  specify  no  IDs,  the  system  returns  information  about all
          agents/Connectors associated with your AWS user account.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          You can filter the request using various logical operators and a key
          -value format. For example:
              {"key": "collectionStatus", "value": "STARTED"}

          (structure)
              A filter that can use conditional operators.

              For more information about filters, see Querying Discovered Con-
              figuration Items in the AWS Application Discovery  Service  User
              Guide .

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              values -> (list)
                 A string value on which to filter. For example, if you choose
                 the destinationServer.osVersion filter name, you could  spec-
                 ify Ubuntu for the value.

                 (string)

              condition -> (string)
                 A  conditional  operator.  The following operators are valid:
                 EQUALS, NOT_EQUALS, CONTAINS, NOT_CONTAINS.  If  you  specify
                 multiple  filters,  the system utilizes all filters as though
                 concatenated by AND . If you specify multiple  values  for  a
                 particular filter, the system differentiates the values using
                 OR . Calling either DescribeConfigurations or  ListConfigura-
                 tions returns attributes of matching configuration items.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string,condition=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...],
              "condition": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
