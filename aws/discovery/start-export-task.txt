START-EXPORT-TASK()                                        START-EXPORT-TASK()



NAME
       start-export-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Begins the export of discovered data to an S3 bucket.

       If you specify agentIds in a filter, the task exports up to 72 hours of
       detailed data collected by the identified Application Discovery  Agent,
       including  network,  process, and performance details. A time range for
       exported agent data may be set by using startTime and endTime .  Export
       of detailed agent data is limited to five concurrently running exports.

       If you do not include an agentIds filter, summary data is exported that
       includes both AWS Agentless Discovery Connector data and  summary  data
       from AWS Discovery Agents. Export of summary data is limited to two ex-
       ports per day.

SYNOPSIS
            start-export-task
          [--export-data-format <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --export-data-format (list)
          The file format for the returned export data. Default value is CSV .
          Note:  The  GRAPHML  option has been deprecated.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            CSV
            GRAPHML

       --filters (list)
          If  a filter is present, it selects the single agentId of the Appli-
          cation Discovery Agent for which data is exported. The  agentId  can
          be found in the results of the DescribeAgents API or CLI. If no fil-
          ter is present, startTime and endTime are ignored and exported  data
          includes  both  Agentless  Discovery Connector data and summary data
          from Application Discovery agents.

          (structure)
              Used to select which agent's data is to be  exported.  A  single
              agent  ID  may  be selected for export using the StartExportTask
              action.

              name -> (string)
                 A single ExportFilter name. Supported filters: agentId .

              values -> (list)
                 A single agentId for a Discovery Agent.  An  agentId  can  be
                 found using the DescribeAgents action. Typically an ADS agen-
                 tId is in the form o-0123456789abcdef0 .

                 (string)

              condition -> (string)
                 Supported condition: EQUALS

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string,condition=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...],
              "condition": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start timestamp for exported data from  the  single  Application
          Discovery  Agent  selected in the filters. If no value is specified,
          data is exported starting from  the  first  data  collected  by  the
          agent.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end timestamp for exported data from the single Application Dis-
          covery Agent selected in the filters. If no value is specified,  ex-
          ported data includes the most recent data collected by the agent.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       exportId -> (string)
          A unique identifier used to query the status of an export request.
