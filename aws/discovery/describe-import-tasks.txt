DESCRIBE-IMPORT-TASKS()                                DESCRIBE-IMPORT-TASKS()



NAME
       describe-import-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns an array of import tasks for your account, including status in-
       formation, times, IDs, the Amazon S3 Object URL for  the  import  file,
       and more.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-import-tasks  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: tasks

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An array of name-value pairs that you provide to filter the  results
          for  the DescribeImportTask request to a specific subset of results.
          Currently, wildcard values aren't supported for filters.

          (structure)
              A name-values pair of elements you can use to filter the results
              when  querying  your  import tasks. Currently, wildcards are not
              supported for filters.

              NOTE:
                 When filtering by import status, all other filter values  are
                 ignored.

              name -> (string)
                 The  name,  status,  or  import task ID for a specific import
                 task.

              values -> (list)
                 An array of strings that you can provide to match  against  a
                 specific  name,  status,  or import task ID to filter the re-
                 sults for your import task queries.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "IMPORT_TASK_ID"|"STATUS"|"NAME"|"FILE_CLASSIFICATION",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          The token to request the next page of results.

       tasks -> (list)
          A  returned array of import tasks that match any applied filters, up
          to the specified number of maximum results.

          (structure)
              An array of information related to the import task request  that
              includes  status  information,  times, IDs, the Amazon S3 Object
              URL for the import file, and more.

              importTaskId -> (string)
                 The unique ID for a specific import task.  These  IDs  aren't
                 globally  unique,  but  they  are unique within an Amazon Web
                 Services account.

              clientRequestToken -> (string)
                 A unique token used to prevent the same import  request  from
                 occurring  more  than  once. If you didn't provide a token, a
                 token was automatically generated when the  import  task  re-
                 quest was sent.

              name -> (string)
                 A  descriptive name for an import task. You can use this name
                 to filter future requests related to this import  task,  such
                 as identifying applications and servers that were included in
                 this import task. We recommend that you use a meaningful name
                 for each import task.

              importUrl -> (string)
                 The  URL  for your import file that you've uploaded to Amazon
                 S3.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the import task. An import can have the  status
                 of IMPORT_COMPLETE and still have some records fail to import
                 from the overall request. More information can  be  found  in
                 the  downloadable  archive  defined in the errorsAndFailedEn-
                 triesZip field, or in the Migration Hub management console.

              importRequestTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the import task request was made, presented  in
                 the Unix time stamp format.

              importCompletionTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time that the import task request finished, presented in
                 the Unix time stamp format.

              importDeletedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the import task request was deleted,  presented
                 in the Unix time stamp format.

              fileClassification -> (string)
                 The type of file detected by the import task.

              serverImportSuccess -> (integer)
                 The  total  number  of server records in the import file that
                 were successfully imported.

              serverImportFailure -> (integer)
                 The total number of server records in the  import  file  that
                 failed to be imported.

              applicationImportSuccess -> (integer)
                 The  total  number  of application records in the import file
                 that were successfully imported.

              applicationImportFailure -> (integer)
                 The total number of application records in  the  import  file
                 that failed to be imported.

              errorsAndFailedEntriesZip -> (string)
                 A  link  to  a  compressed archive folder (in the ZIP format)
                 that contains an error log and a file of failed records.  You
                 can  use  these  two  files  to quickly identify records that
                 failed, why they failed, and correct  those  records.  After-
                 ward,  you  can  upload  the corrected file to your Amazon S3
                 bucket and create another import task request.

                 This field also includes authorization information so you can
                 confirm the authenticity of the compressed archive before you
                 download it.

                 If some records failed to be imported we recommend  that  you
                 correct  the  records in the failed entries file and then im-
                 ports that failed entries file. This prevents you from having
                 to  correct  and  update the larger original file and attempt
                 importing it again.
