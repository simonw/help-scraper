UPDATE-DISTRIBUTION-BUNDLE()                      UPDATE-DISTRIBUTION-BUNDLE()



NAME
       update-distribution-bundle -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  bundle  of your Amazon Lightsail content delivery network
       (CDN) distribution.

       A distribution bundle specifies the monthly network transfer quota  and
       monthly cost of your distribution.

       Update  your  distribution's  bundle if your distribution is going over
       its monthly network transfer quota and is incurring an overage fee.

       You can update your distribution's bundle only  one  time  within  your
       monthly  AWS billing cycle. To determine if you can update your distri-
       bution's bundle, use the GetDistributions action. The  ableToUpdateBun-
       dle parameter in the result will indicate whether you can currently up-
       date your distribution's bundle.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-distribution-bundle
          [--distribution-name <value>]
          [--bundle-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --distribution-name (string)
          The name of the distribution for which to update the bundle.

          Use the GetDistributions action to get a list of distribution  names
          that you can specify.

       --bundle-id (string)
          The bundle ID of the new bundle to apply to your distribution.

          Use  the GetDistributionBundles action to get a list of distribution
          bundle IDs that you can specify.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
