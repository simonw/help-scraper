GET-LOAD-BALANCER-TLS-CERTIFICATES()      GET-LOAD-BALANCER-TLS-CERTIFICATES()



NAME
       get-load-balancer-tls-certificates -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about the TLS certificates that are associated with
       the specified Lightsail load balancer.

       TLS is just an updated, more secure  version  of  Secure  Socket  Layer
       (SSL).

       You  can  have  a maximum of 2 certificates associated with a Lightsail
       load balancer. One is active and the other is inactive.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-load-balancer-tls-certificates
          --load-balancer-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-name (string)
          The name of the load balancer you associated with your SSL/TLS  cer-
          tificate.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about TLS certificates for a load balancer

       The following get-load-balancer-tls-certificates example  displays  de-
       tails about the TLS certificates for the specified load balancer.

          aws lightsail get-load-balancer-tls-certificates \
              --load-balancer-name LoadBalancer-1

                       validate  one  or more domain names of the certificate.

                       the  certificate  won't  be renewed. Check to make sure
                       your certificate's domain validation records  exist  in
                       your domain's DNS, and that your certificate remains in
