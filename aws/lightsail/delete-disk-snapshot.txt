DELETE-DISK-SNAPSHOT()                                  DELETE-DISK-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       delete-disk-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the specified disk snapshot.

       When you make periodic snapshots of a disk, the snapshots are incremen-
       tal, and only the blocks on the device that  have  changed  since  your
       last  snapshot  are  saved in the new snapshot. When you delete a snap-
       shot, only the data not needed for any other snapshot  is  removed.  So
       regardless of which prior snapshots have been deleted, all active snap-
       shots will have access to all the information  needed  to  restore  the
       disk.

       The  delete  disk  snapshot operation supports tag-based access control
       via resource tags applied to the resource identified by  disk  snapshot
       name . For more information, see the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-disk-snapshot
          --disk-snapshot-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --disk-snapshot-name (string)
          The   name   of   the  disk  snapshot  you  want  to  delete  (e.g.,
          my-disk-snapshot ).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a snapshot of a block storage disk

       The  following delete-disk-snapshot example deletes the specified snap-
       shot of a block storage disk
