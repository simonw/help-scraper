CREATE-DOMAIN()                                                CREATE-DOMAIN()



NAME
       create-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a domain resource for the specified domain (e.g., example.com).

       The  create  domain operation supports tag-based access control via re-
       quest tags. For more information, see the  Amazon  Lightsail  Developer
       Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-domain
          --domain-name <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The domain name to manage (e.g., example.com ).

          NOTE:
              You  cannot register a new domain name using Lightsail. You must
              register a domain name using Amazon Route 53 or  another  domain
              name  registrar. If you have already registered your domain, you
              can enter its name in this parameter to manage the  DNS  records
              for that domain using Lightsail.

       --tags (list)
          The  tag keys and optional values to add to the resource during cre-
          ate.

          Use the TagResource action to tag a resource after it's created.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag key and optional value  assigned  to  an  Amazon
              Lightsail resource.

              For  more  information  about  tags in Lightsail, see the Amazon
              Lightsail Developer Guide .

              key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

                 Constraints: Tag keys accept a maximum of 128  letters,  num-
                 bers, spaces in UTF-8, or the following characters: + - = . _
                 : / @

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

                 Constraints: Tag values accept a maximum of 256 letters, num-
                 bers, spaces in UTF-8, or the following characters: + - = . _
                 : / @

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a domain (DNS zone)

       The following create-domain example creates a DNS zone for  the  speci-
       fied domain.

       Note:  Lightsail's  domain-related API operations are available in only
       the us-east-1 Region. If your CLI profile is configured to use  a  dif-
       ferent Region, you must include the --region us-east-1 parameter or the
       command fails.

          aws lightsail create-domain \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --domain-name example.com

       Output:

          {
              "operation": {
                  "id": "64e522c8-9ae1-4c05-9b65-3f237324dc34",
                  "resourceName": "example.com",
                  "resourceType": "Domain",
                  "createdAt": 1569864291.92,
                  "location": {
                      "availabilityZone": "all",
                      "regionName": "global"
                  },
                  "isTerminal": true,
                  "operationType": "CreateDomain",
                  "status": "Succeeded",
                  "statusChangedAt": 1569864292.109
