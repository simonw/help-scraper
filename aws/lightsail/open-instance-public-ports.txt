OPEN-INSTANCE-PUBLIC-PORTS()                      OPEN-INSTANCE-PUBLIC-PORTS()



NAME
       open-instance-public-ports -

DESCRIPTION
       Opens ports for a specific Amazon Lightsail instance, and specifies the
       IP addresses allowed to connect to the instance through the ports,  and
       the protocol.

       The  OpenInstancePublicPorts  action  supports tag-based access control
       via resource tags applied to the resource identified by instanceName  .
       For more information, see the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            open-instance-public-ports
          --port-info <value>
          --instance-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --port-info (structure)
          An object to describe the ports to open for the specified instance.

          fromPort -> (integer)
              The first port in a range of open ports on an instance.

              Allowed ports:

              o TCP and UDP - 0 to 65535

              o ICMP  - The ICMP type for IPv4 addresses. For example, specify
                8 as the fromPort (ICMP type), and  -1  as  the  toPort  (ICMP
                code),  to enable ICMP Ping. For more information, see Control
                Messages on Wikipedia .

              o ICMPv6 - The ICMP type for IPv6 addresses. For example,  spec-
                ify 128 as the fromPort (ICMPv6 type), and 0 as toPort (ICMPv6
                code). For more information, see Internet Control Message Pro-
                tocol for IPv6 .

          toPort -> (integer)
              The last port in a range of open ports on an instance.

              Allowed ports:

              o TCP and UDP - 0 to 65535

              o ICMP  - The ICMP code for IPv4 addresses. For example, specify
                8 as the fromPort (ICMP type), and  -1  as  the  toPort  (ICMP
                code),  to enable ICMP Ping. For more information, see Control
                Messages on Wikipedia .

              o ICMPv6 - The ICMP code for IPv6 addresses. For example,  spec-
                ify 128 as the fromPort (ICMPv6 type), and 0 as toPort (ICMPv6
                code). For more information, see Internet Control Message Pro-
                tocol for IPv6 .

          protocol -> (string)
              The IP protocol name.

              The name can be one of the following:

              o tcp  -  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) provides reliable,
                ordered, and error-checked delivery of streamed  data  between
                applications  running on hosts communicating by an IP network.
                If you have an application that doesn't require reliable  data
                stream service, use UDP instead.

              o all - All transport layer protocol types. For more general in-
                formation, see Transport layer on Wikipedia .

              o udp - With User Datagram Protocol (UDP), computer applications
                can send messages (or datagrams) to other hosts on an Internet
                Protocol (IP) network. Prior communications are  not  required
                to  set  up  transmission channels or data paths. Applications
                that don't require reliable data stream service can  use  UDP,
                which  provides  a connectionless datagram service that empha-
                sizes reduced latency over reliability. If you do require  re-
                liable data stream service, use TCP instead.

              o icmp  -  Internet  Control  Message Protocol (ICMP) is used to
                send error messages  and  operational  information  indicating
                success  or  failure  when communicating with an instance. For
                example, an error is indicated when an instance could  not  be
                reached.  When  you  specify  icmp  as the protocol , you must
                specify the ICMP type using the fromPort parameter,  and  ICMP
                code using the toPort parameter.

          cidrs -> (list)
              The  IPv4 address, or range of IPv4 addresses (in CIDR notation)
              that are allowed to connect to an instance  through  the  ports,
              and the protocol.

              NOTE:
                 The ipv6Cidrs parameter lists the IPv6 addresses that are al-
                 lowed to connect to an instance.

              Examples:

              o To allow the IP address 192.0.2.44  ,  specify  192.0.2.44  or
                192.0.2.44/32 .

              o To  allow  the IP addresses 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255 , specify
                192.0.2.0/24 .

              For more information about CIDR block  notation,  see  Classless
              Inter-Domain Routing on Wikipedia .

              (string)

          ipv6Cidrs -> (list)
              The  IPv6 address, or range of IPv6 addresses (in CIDR notation)
              that are allowed to connect to an instance  through  the  ports,
              and  the protocol. Only devices with an IPv6 address can connect
              to an instance through IPv6; otherwise, IPv4 should be used.

              NOTE:
                 The cidrs parameter lists the IPv4 addresses that are allowed
                 to connect to an instance.

              For  more  information  about CIDR block notation, see Classless
              Inter-Domain Routing on Wikipedia .

              (string)

          cidrListAliases -> (list)
              An alias that defines access for a preconfigured range of IP ad-
              dresses.

              The  only alias currently supported is lightsail-connect , which
              allows IP addresses of the browser-based RDP/SSH client  in  the
              Lightsail console to connect to your instance.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          fromPort=integer,toPort=integer,protocol=string,cidrs=string,string,ipv6Cidrs=string,string,cidrListAliases=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "fromPort": integer,
            "toPort": integer,
            "protocol": "tcp"|"all"|"udp"|"icmp",
            "cidrs": ["string", ...],
            "ipv6Cidrs": ["string", ...],
            "cidrListAliases": ["string", ...]
          }

       --instance-name (string)
          The name of the instance for which to open ports.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
