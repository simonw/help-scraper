DELETE-INSTANCE-SNAPSHOT()                          DELETE-INSTANCE-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       delete-instance-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a specific snapshot of a virtual private server (or instance ).

       The  delete  instance snapshot operation supports tag-based access con-
       trol via resource tags applied to the resource identified  by  instance
       snapshot  name  . For more information, see the Amazon Lightsail Devel-
       oper Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-instance-snapshot
          --instance-snapshot-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-snapshot-name (string)
          The name of the snapshot to delete.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
