NAME
       tag-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  one or more tags to the specified Amazon Lightsail resource. Each
       resource can have a maximum of 50 tags. Each tag consists of a key  and
       an  optional  value. Tag keys must be unique per resource. For more in-
       formation about tags, see the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide .

       The tag resource operation supports tag-based access  control  via  re-
       quest  tags and resource tags applied to the resource identified by re-
       source name . For more information, see the Amazon Lightsail  Developer
       Guide .

OPTIONS
       --resource-name (string)
          The name of the resource to which you are adding tags.

       --resource-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource to which you want to
          add a tag.

       --tags (list)
          The tag key and optional value.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag key and optional value  assigned  to  an  Amazon
              Lightsail resource.

              For  more  information  about  tags in Lightsail, see the Amazon
              Lightsail Developer Guide .

              key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

                 Constraints: Tag keys accept a maximum of 128  letters,  num-
                 bers, spaces in UTF-8, or the following characters: + - = . _
                 : / @

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

                 Constraints: Tag values accept a maximum of 256 letters, num-
                 bers, spaces in UTF-8, or the following characters: + - = . _
                 : / @

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
