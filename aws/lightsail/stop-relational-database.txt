STOP-RELATIONAL-DATABASE()                          STOP-RELATIONAL-DATABASE()



NAME
       stop-relational-database -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops  a  specific  database that is currently running in Amazon Light-
       sail.

       The stop relational database operation supports tag-based  access  con-
       trol  via resource tags applied to the resource identified by relation-
       alDatabaseName. For more information, see the Amazon  Lightsail  Devel-
       oper Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            stop-relational-database
          --relational-database-name <value>
          [--relational-database-snapshot-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --relational-database-name (string)
          The name of your database to stop.

       --relational-database-snapshot-name (string)
          The name of your new database snapshot to be created before stopping
          your database.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To stop a relational database

       The following stop-relational-database example stops the specified  re-
       lational database.
