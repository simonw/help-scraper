OPTIONS
       --instance-name (string)
          The name of the instance for which you want to get metrics data.

       --metric-name (string)
          The metric for which you want to return information.

          Valid instance metric names are listed below, along  with  the  most
          useful statistics to include in your request, and the published unit
          value.

          o

            **
            BurstCapacityPercentage ** - The  percentage  of  CPU  performance
            available  for your instance to burst above its baseline. Your in-
            stance continuously accrues and consumes burst capacity. Burst ca-
            pacity stops accruing when your instance's BurstCapacityPercentage
            reaches 100%. For more information, see Viewing instance burst ca-
            pacity in Amazon Lightsail .  Statistics : The most useful statis-
            tics are Maximum and Average .  Unit : The published unit is  Per-
            cent .

          o

            **
            BurstCapacityTime  **  - The available amount of time for your in-
            stance to burst at 100% CPU utilization.  Your  instance  continu-
            ously  accrues  and  consumes  burst capacity. Burst capacity time
            stops accruing when your instance's BurstCapacityPercentage metric
            reaches  100%.  Burst  capacity  time is consumed at the full rate
            only when your instance operates at 100% CPU utilization. For  ex-
            ample,  if  your  instance  operates at 50% CPU utilization in the
            burstable zone for a 5-minute period, then it consumes  CPU  burst
            capacity  minutes at a 50% rate in that period. Your instance con-
            sumed 2 minutes and 30 seconds of CPU burst  capacity  minutes  in
            the  5-minute  period.  For more information, see Viewing instance
            burst capacity in Amazon Lightsail .  Statistics : The most useful
            statistics are Maximum and Average .  Unit : The published unit is
            Seconds .

          o

            **
            CPUUtilization ** - The percentage of allocated compute units that
            are  currently  in use on the instance. This metric identifies the
            processing power to run the applications on the instance. Tools in
            your  operating  system can show a lower percentage than Lightsail
            when the instance is not allocated a full processor core.  Statis-
            tics  : The most useful statistics are Maximum and Average .  Unit

          o

            **
            NetworkIn ** - The number of bytes received on all network  inter-
            faces by the instance. This metric identifies the volume of incom-
            ing network traffic to the instance. The number  reported  is  the
            number of bytes received during the period. Because this metric is
            reported in 5-minute intervals, divide the reported number by  300
            to  find  Bytes/second.  Statistics : The most useful statistic is
            Sum .  Unit : The published unit is Bytes .

            **
            NetworkOut ** - The number of bytes sent out on all network inter-
            faces by the instance. This metric identifies the volume of outgo-
            ing network traffic from the instance. The number reported is  the
            number of bytes sent during the period. Because this metric is re-
            ported in 5-minute intervals, divide the reported number by 300 to
            find  Bytes/second.  Statistics : The most useful statistic is Sum

            StatusCheckFailed ** - Reports  whether  the  instance  passed  or
            failed both the instance status check and the system status check.
            This metric can be either 0 (passed) or 1  (failed).  This  metric
            data  is  available in 1-minute (60 seconds) granularity.  Statis-

       --statistics (list)
          The statistic for the metric.

          The following statistics are available:

          o Minimum - The lowest value observed during the  specified  period.
            Use  this  value to determine low volumes of activity for your ap-
            plication.

          o Maximum - The highest value observed during the specified  period.
            Use  this value to determine high volumes of activity for your ap-
            plication.

          o Sum - All values submitted for the matching metric added together.
            You can use this statistic to determine the total volume of a met-
            ric.

          o Average - The value of Sum / SampleCount during the specified  pe-
            riod.  By  comparing  this  statistic with the Minimum and Maximum
            values, you can determine the full scope of a metric and how close
            the average use is to the Minimum and Maximum values. This compar-
            ison helps you to know when  to  increase  or  decrease  your  re-
            sources.

          o SampleCount  -  The  count, or number, of data points used for the
            statistical calculation.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            Minimum
            Maximum
            Sum
            Average
            SampleCount

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get metric data for an instance

       The following get-instance-metric-data example returns the average per-
       cent  of CPUUtilization every 7200 seconds (2 hours) between 1571342400
       and 1571428800 for instance MEAN-1.

       We recommend that you use a unix time converter to identify  the  start
       and end times.
