NAME
       get-relational-database-metric-data -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the data points of the specified metric for a database in Ama-
       zon Lightsail.

       Metrics report the utilization of your resources, and the error  counts
       generated  by  them. Monitor and collect metric data regularly to main-
       tain the reliability, availability, and performance of your resources.

            1538424000 as the end time.

       --unit (string)
          The unit for the metric data request. Valid units depend on the met-
          ric data being requested. For the valid units  with  each  available

       --statistics (list)
          The statistic for the metric.

          The following statistics are available:

          o Minimum  -  The lowest value observed during the specified period.
            Use this value to determine low volumes of activity for  your  ap-
            plication.

          o Maximum  - The highest value observed during the specified period.
            Use this value to determine high volumes of activity for your  ap-
            plication.

          o Sum - All values submitted for the matching metric added together.
            You can use this statistic to determine the total volume of a met-
            ric.

          o Average  - The value of Sum / SampleCount during the specified pe-
            riod. By comparing this statistic with  the  Minimum  and  Maximum
            values, you can determine the full scope of a metric and how close
            the average use is to the Minimum and Maximum values. This compar-
            ison  helps  you  to  know  when  to increase or decrease your re-
            sources.

          o SampleCount - The count, or number, of data points  used  for  the
            statistical calculation.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            Minimum
            Maximum
            Sum
            Average
            SampleCount

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get metric data for a relational database

       The  following  get-relational-database-metric-data example returns the
       count sum of the metric DatabaseConnections over the period of 24 hours
       (86400  seconds) between 1570733176 and 1571597176 for relational data-
       base Database1.

       We recommend that you use a unix time converter to identify  the  start
       and end times.
