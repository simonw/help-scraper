SYNOPSIS
            get-buckets
          [--bucket-name <value>]
          [--page-token <value>]
          [--include-connected-resources | --no-include-connected-resources]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket-name (string)
          The name of the bucket for which to return information.

          When omitted, the response includes all of your buckets in  the  AWS
          Region where the request is made.

       --page-token (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of results from your request.

          To  get a page token, perform an initial GetBuckets request. If your
          results are paginated, the response will return a  next  page  token
          that you can specify as the page token in a subsequent request.

       --include-connected-resources | --no-include-connected-resources (bool-
       ean)
          A Boolean value that indicates  whether  to  include  Lightsail  in-
          stances   that   were   given   access   to  the  bucket  using  the
          SetResourceAccessForBucket action.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       buckets -> (list)
          An array of objects that describe buckets.

          (structure)
              Describes an Amazon Lightsail bucket.

              resourceType -> (string)
                 The  Lightsail  resource  type  of  the  bucket (for example,
                 Bucket ).

              accessRules -> (structure)
                 An object that describes the access rules of the bucket.

                 getObject -> (string)
                     Specifies the  anonymous  access  to  all  objects  in  a
                     bucket.

                     The following options can be specified:

                     o public  -  Sets  all  objects  in  the bucket to public
                       (read-only), making them  readable  by  anyone  in  the
                       world.  If  the getObject value is set to public , then
                       all objects in the bucket default to public  regardless
                       of the allowPublicOverrides value.

                     o private  -  Sets  all objects in the bucket to private,
                       making them readable only by you or anyone you give ac-
                       cess to. If the getObject value is set to private , and
                       the allowPublicOverrides value is set to  true  ,  then
                       all  objects  in  the  bucket default to private unless
                       they are configured with a public-read ACL.  Individual
                       objects  with  a public-read ACL are readable by anyone
                       in the world.

                 allowPublicOverrides -> (boolean)
                     A Boolean value that indicates whether the access control
                     list (ACL) permissions that are applied to individual ob-
                     jects override the getObject  option  that  is  currently
                     specified.

                     When this is true, you can use the PutObjectAcl Amazon S3
                     API  action  to  set   individual   objects   to   public
                     (read-only)  using the public-read ACL, or to private us-
                     ing the private ACL.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the bucket.

              bundleId -> (string)
                 The ID of the bundle currently applied to the bucket.

                 A bucket bundle specifies the monthly  cost,  storage  space,
                 and data transfer quota for a bucket.

                 Use  the  UpdateBucketBundle action to change the bundle of a
                 bucket.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp when the distribution was created.

                     The Availability  Zone.  Follows  the  format  us-east-2a
                     (case-sensitive).

                 regionName -> (string)
                     The AWS Region name.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the bucket.

              supportCode -> (string)
                 The  support  code  for  a  bucket. Include this code in your
                 email to support when you have questions  about  a  Lightsail
                 bucket.  This  code  enables our support team to look up your
                 Lightsail information more easily.

              tags -> (list)
                 The tag keys and optional values for the bucket. For more in-
                 formation,  see Tags in Amazon Lightsail in the Amazon Light-
                 sail Developer Guide .

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag key and optional  value  assigned  to  an
                     Amazon Lightsail resource.

              objectVersioning -> (string)
                 Indicates  whether  object  versioning  is  enabled  for  the
                 bucket.

                 The following options can be configured:

                 o Enabled - Object versioning is enabled.

                 o Suspended - Object versioning was previously enabled but is

              ableToUpdateBundle -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the bundle that is currently applied  to  a
                 bucket can be changed to another bundle.

                 You  can  update  a  bucket's  bundle  only one time within a
                 monthly AWS billing cycle.

                 Use the UpdateBucketBundle action to change a  bucket's  bun-

                 An array of objects that describe  Lightsail  instances  that
                 have access to the bucket.

                 Use  the  SetResourceAccessForBucket action to update the in-
                 stances that have access to a bucket.

                 (structure)
                     Describes an Amazon Lightsail instance that has access to

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the Lightsail instance.

                     resourceType -> (string)
                        The Lightsail resource type (for example, Instance ).

              state -> (structure)
                 An object that describes the state of the bucket.

                 code -> (string)

                     o Unknown  - Creation of the bucket might have timed-out.
                       You might want to delete the bucket and  create  a  new
                       one.

                 message -> (string)
                     A message that describes the state of the bucket.

              accessLogConfig -> (structure)

                 bucket.

                 enabled -> (boolean)
                     A Boolean value that indicates whether bucket access log-
                     ging is enabled for the bucket.

                 destination -> (string)
                     The  name  of  the  bucket where the access is saved. The
                     destination can be a Lightsail bucket  in  the  same  ac-
                     count, and in the same AWS Region as the source bucket.

                     NOTE:
                        This  parameter  is  required when enabling the access
                        log for a bucket, and should be omitted when disabling
                        the access log.

                 prefix -> (string)
                     The optional object prefix for the bucket access log.

                     The prefix is an optional addition to the object key that
                     organizes  your  access  log  files  in  the  destination
                     bucket.  For example, if you specify a logs/ prefix, then
                     each log object will begin with the logs/ prefix  in  its
                     key                     (for                     example,
                     logs/2021-11-01-21-32-16-E568B2907131C0C0 ).

                     NOTE:
                        This parameter can be optionally  specified  when  en-
                        abling  the  access  log  for  a bucket, and should be
                        omitted when disabling the access log.

       nextPageToken -> (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of results from your request.

          A next page token is not returned if there are no  more  results  to
          display.

          To  get the next page of results, perform another GetBuckets request
          and specify the next page token using the pageToken parameter.
