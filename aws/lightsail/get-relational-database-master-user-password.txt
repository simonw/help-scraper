SYNOPSIS
            get-relational-database-master-user-password
          --relational-database-name <value>
          [--password-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --relational-database-name (string)
          The name of your database for which to get the master user password.

       --password-version (string)
          The password version to return.

          Specifying CURRENT or PREVIOUS returns the current or previous pass-
          words respectively. Specifying PENDING returns the newest version of
          the password that will rotate to CURRENT . After the  PENDING  pass-
          word  rotates  to CURRENT , the PENDING password is no longer avail-
          able.

          Default: CURRENT

          Possible values:

          o CURRENT

          o PREVIOUS

          o PENDING

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
