START-RELATIONAL-DATABASE()                        START-RELATIONAL-DATABASE()



NAME
       start-relational-database -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts a specific database from a stopped state in Amazon Lightsail. To
       restart a database, use the reboot relational database operation.

       The start relational database operation supports tag-based access  con-
       trol  via resource tags applied to the resource identified by relation-
       alDatabaseName. For more information, see the Amazon  Lightsail  Devel-
       oper Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-relational-database
          --relational-database-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --relational-database-name (string)
          The name of your database to start.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
