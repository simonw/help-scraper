NAME
       get-cloud-formation-stack-records -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the CloudFormation stack record created as a result of the cre-
       ate cloud formation stack operation.

       An AWS CloudFormation stack is used to create a new Amazon EC2 instance
       from an exported Lightsail snapshot.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-cloud-formation-stack-records  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: cloudFormationStackRecords

SYNOPSIS
            get-cloud-formation-stack-records
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the CloudFormation stack records and their associated stacks

       The  following  get-cloud-formation-stack-records  example displays de-
       tails about the  CloudFormation  stack  records  and  their  associated
       stacks  used to create Amazon EC2 resources from exported Amazon Light-
       sail snapshots.

       nextPageToken -> (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of results from your request.

          A next page token is not returned if there are no  more  results  to
          display.

          To  get the next page of results, perform another GetCloudFormation-
          StackRecords request and specify the next page token using the page-
          Token parameter.
