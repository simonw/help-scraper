GET-BLUEPRINTS()                                              GET-BLUEPRINTS()



NAME
       get-blueprints -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the list of available instance images, or blueprints . You can
       use a blueprint to create a new instance already running a specific op-
       erating system, as well as a preinstalled app or development stack. The
       software each instance is running depends on the  blueprint  image  you
       choose.

       NOTE:
          Use  active  blueprints  when creating new instances. Inactive blue-
          prints are listed to support customers with existing  instances  and
          are  not  necessarily  available to create new instances. Blueprints
          are marked inactive when they become outdated due to operating  sys-
          tem updates or new application releases.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-blueprints  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: blueprints

SYNOPSIS
            get-blueprints
          [--include-inactive | --no-include-inactive]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --include-inactive | --no-include-inactive (boolean)
          A Boolean value indicating whether to include  inactive  results  in
          your request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       blueprints -> (list)
          An  array  of  key-value  pairs  that contains information about the
          available blueprints.

          (structure)
              Describes a blueprint (a virtual private server image).

              blueprintId -> (string)
                 The ID for the virtual private server image (e.g.,  app_word-
                 press_4_4 or app_lamp_7_0 ).

              name -> (string)
                 The friendly name of the blueprint (e.g., Amazon Linux ).

              group -> (string)
                 The group name of the blueprint (e.g., amazon-linux ).

              type -> (string)
                 The type of the blueprint (e.g., os or app ).

              description -> (string)
                 The description of the blueprint.

              isActive -> (boolean)
                 A  Boolean  value indicating whether the blueprint is active.
                 Inactive blueprints are listed to support customers with  ex-
                 isting instances but are not necessarily available for launch
                 of new instances. Blueprints are marked  inactive  when  they
                 become outdated due to operating system updates or new appli-
                 cation releases.

              minPower -> (integer)
                 The minimum bundle power required to run this blueprint.  For
                 example,  you need a bundle with a power value of 500 or more
                 to create an instance that uses a blueprint  with  a  minimum
                 power  value  of  500. 0 indicates that the blueprint runs on
                 all instance sizes.

              version -> (string)
                 The version number of the operating system,  application,  or
                 stack (e.g., 2016.03.0 ).

              versionCode -> (string)
                 The version code.

              productUrl -> (string)
                 The product URL to learn more about the image or blueprint.

              licenseUrl -> (string)
                 The  end-user  license  agreement  URL for the image or blue-
                 print.

              platform -> (string)
                 The operating system  platform  (either  Linux/Unix-based  or
                 Windows Server-based) of the blueprint.

       nextPageToken -> (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of results from your request.

          A  next  page  token is not returned if there are no more results to
          display.

          To get the next page of results, perform another  GetBlueprints  re-
          quest and specify the next page token using the pageToken parameter.
