NAME
       delete-bucket -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a Amazon Lightsail bucket.

       NOTE:
          When  you delete your bucket, the bucket name is released and can be
          reused for a new bucket in your account or another AWS account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-bucket
          --bucket-name <value>
          [--force-delete | --no-force-delete]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket-name (string)
          The name of the bucket to delete.

          Use the  GetBuckets action to get a list of bucket  names  that  you
          can specify.

       --force-delete | --no-force-delete (boolean)
          A Boolean value that indicates whether to force delete the bucket.

          You must force delete the bucket if it has one of the following con-
          ditions:

          o The bucket is the origin of a distribution.

          o The bucket has instances that were granted access to it using  the
            SetResourceAccessForBucket action.

          o The bucket has objects.

          o The bucket has access keys.

          WARNING:
              Force  deleting  a bucket might impact other resources that rely
              on the bucket, such as  instances,  distributions,  or  software
              that use the issued access keys.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
