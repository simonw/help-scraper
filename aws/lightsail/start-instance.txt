START-INSTANCE()                                              START-INSTANCE()



NAME
       start-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  a  specific  Amazon Lightsail instance from a stopped state. To
       restart an instance, use the reboot instance operation.

       NOTE:
          When you start a stopped instance, Lightsail assigns a new public IP
          address  to  the instance. To use the same IP address after stopping
          and starting an instance, create a static IP address and  attach  it
          to  the instance. For more information, see the Amazon Lightsail De-
          veloper Guide .

       The start instance operation supports tag-based access control via  re-
       source  tags  applied to the resource identified by instance name . For
       more information, see the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            start-instance
          --instance-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-name (string)
          The name of the instance (a virtual private server) to start.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
