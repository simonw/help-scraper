OPTIONS
       --distribution-name (string)
          The name of the distribution to update.

          Use  the GetDistributions action to get a list of distribution names
          that you can specify.

       --origin (structure)
          An object that describes the origin resource for  the  distribution,
          such as a Lightsail instance or load balancer.

          The distribution pulls, caches, and serves content from the origin.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the origin resource.

          regionName -> (string)
              The AWS Region name of the origin resource.

          protocolPolicy -> (string)
              The  protocol  that your Amazon Lightsail distribution uses when
              establishing a connection with your origin to pull content.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,regionName=string,protocolPolicy=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "name": "string",
            "regionName": "us-east-1"|"us-east-2"|"us-west-1"|"us-west-2"|"eu-west-1"|"eu-west-2"|"eu-west-3"|"eu-central-1"|"ca-central-1"|"ap-south-1"|"ap-southeast-1"|"ap-southeast-2"|"ap-northeast-1"|"ap-northeast-2"|"eu-north-1",
            "protocolPolicy": "http-only"|"https-only"
          }

       --default-cache-behavior (structure)
          An object that describes the default cache behavior for the  distri-
          bution.

          behavior -> (string)
              The cache behavior of the distribution.

              The following cache behaviors can be specified:

              o

                **
                cache  **  - This option is best for static sites. When speci-
                fied, your distribution caches and serves your entire  website
                as  static  content.  This behavior is ideal for websites with
                static content that doesn't change depending on who views  it,
                or  for  websites  that  don't  use cookies, headers, or query
                strings to personalize content.

              o

                **
                dont-cache ** - This option is best for sites that serve a mix
                of  static and dynamic content. When specified, your distribu-
                tion caches and serve only the content that  is  specified  in
                the distribution's CacheBehaviorPerPath parameter. This behav-
                ior is ideal for websites or web applications that  use  cook-
                ies, headers, and query strings to personalize content for in-
                dividual users.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          behavior=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "behavior": "dont-cache"|"cache"
          }

       --cache-behavior-settings (structure)
          An object that describes the cache behavior settings for the distri-
          bution.

          NOTE:
              The  cacheBehaviorSettings specified in your UpdateDistribution-
              Request will replace your distribution's existing settings.

          defaultTTL -> (long)
              The default amount of time that objects stay  in  the  distribu-
              tion's cache before the distribution forwards another request to
              the origin to determine whether the content has been updated.

              NOTE:
                 The value specified applies only when the origin does not add
                 HTTP  headers  such  as Cache-Control max-age , Cache-Control
                 s-maxage , and Expires to objects.

          minimumTTL -> (long)
              The minimum amount of time that objects stay  in  the  distribu-
              tion's cache before the distribution forwards another request to
              the origin to determine whether the object has been updated.

              A value of 0 must be specified for minimumTTL if  the  distribu-
              tion is configured to forward all headers to the origin.

          maximumTTL -> (long)
              The  maximum  amount  of time that objects stay in the distribu-
              tion's cache before the distribution forwards another request to
              the origin to determine whether the object has been updated.

              The value specified applies only when the origin adds HTTP head-
              ers such as Cache-Control max-age , Cache-Control s-maxage , and
              Expires to objects.

          allowedHTTPMethods -> (string)
              The HTTP methods that are processed and forwarded to the distri-
              bution's origin.

              You can specify the following options:

              o GET,HEAD - The distribution forwards the GET and HEAD methods.

              o GET,HEAD,OPTIONS - The distribution forwards the GET , HEAD  ,
                and OPTIONS methods.

              o GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE - The distribution for-
                wards the GET , HEAD , OPTIONS , PUT ,  PATCH  ,  POST  ,  and
                DELETE methods.

              If  you specify the third option, you might need to restrict ac-
              cess to your distribution's origin so users can't perform opera-
              tions  that  you  don't want them to. For example, you might not
              want users to have permission to delete objects from  your  ori-
              gin.

          cachedHTTPMethods -> (string)
              The HTTP method responses that are cached by your distribution.

              You can specify the following options:

              o GET,HEAD  -  The  distribution caches responses to the GET and
                HEAD methods.

              o GET,HEAD,OPTIONS - The distribution caches  responses  to  the
                GET , HEAD , and OPTIONS methods.

          forwardedCookies -> (structure)
              An  object  that describes the cookies that are forwarded to the
              origin. Your content is cached based on  the  cookies  that  are
              forwarded.

              option -> (string)
                 Specifies which cookies to forward to the distribution's ori-
                 gin for a cache behavior: all , none , or allow-list to  for-
                 ward  only  the cookies specified in the cookiesAllowList pa-
                 rameter.

              cookiesAllowList -> (list)
                 The specific cookies to forward to your  distribution's  ori-
                 gin.

                 (string)

          forwardedHeaders -> (structure)
              An  object  that describes the headers that are forwarded to the
              origin. Your content is cached based on  the  headers  that  are
              forwarded.

              option -> (string)
                 The  headers  that  you  want your distribution to forward to
                 your origin and base caching on.

                 You can configure your distribution to do one of the  follow-
                 ing:

                 o

                   **
                   all ** - Forward all headers to your origin.

                 o

                   **
                   none ** - Forward only the default headers.

                 o

                   **
                   allow-list  ** - Forward only the headers you specify using
                   the headersAllowList parameter.

              headersAllowList -> (list)

                 gin.

                 (string)

          forwardedQueryStrings -> (structure)
              An object that describes the query strings that are forwarded to
              the origin. Your content is cached based on  the  query  strings
              that are forwarded.

              option -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether the distribution forwards and caches based
                 on query strings.

              queryStringsAllowList -> (list)
                 The specific query strings that the distribution forwards  to
                 the origin.

                 Your  distribution  will cache content based on the specified
                 query strings.

                 If the option parameter is true, then your distribution  for-
                 wards all query strings, regardless of what you specify using
                 the queryStringsAllowList parameter.

                 (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "defaultTTL": long,

       --cache-behaviors (list)
          An array of objects that describe the per-path  cache  behavior  for
          the distribution.

          (structure)
              Describes  the  per-path  cache  behavior of an Amazon Lightsail
              content delivery network (CDN) distribution.

              A per-path cache behavior is used to override, or add an  excep-
              tion to, the default cache behavior of a distribution. For exam-
              ple, if the cacheBehavior is set to  cache  ,  then  a  per-path
              cache behavior can be used to specify a directory, file, or file
              type that your distribution will cache. Alternately, if the dis-
              tribution's  cacheBehavior is dont-cache , then a per-path cache
              behavior can be used to specify a directory, file, or file  type
              that your distribution will not cache.

              if the cacheBehavior's behavior is set to 'cache', then

              path -> (string)
                 The  path to a directory or file to cached, or not cache. Use
                 an  asterisk   symbol   to   specify   wildcard   directories
                 (path/to/assets/* ), and file types (*.html, *jpg, *js ). Di-
                 rectories and file paths are case-sensitive.

                 Examples:

                 o Specify the following to cache all files  in  the  document
                   root  of  an  Apache  web server running on a Lightsail in-
                   stance.  var/www/html/

                 o Specify the following file to cache only the index page  in
                   the    document    root    of   an   Apache   web   server.
                   var/www/html/index.html

                 o Specify the following to cache only the .html files in  the
                   document root of an Apache web server.  var/www/html/*.html

                 o Specify  the  following  to  cache only the .jpg, .png, and
                   .gif files in the images sub-directory of the document root
                   of   an   Apache   web  server.   var/www/html/images/*.jpg
                   var/www/html/images/*.png         var/www/html/images/*.gif
                   Specify  the  following  to  cache  all files in the images
                   sub-directory of the document root of an Apache web server.
                   var/www/html/images/

              behavior -> (string)
                 The cache behavior for the specified path.

                 You  can  specify  one of the following per-path cache behav-
                 iors:

                 o

                   **
                   cache ** - This behavior caches the specified path.

                 o

                   **
                   dont-cache ** - This behavior doesn't cache  the  specified
                   path.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          path=string,behavior=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "path": "string",
              "behavior": "dont-cache"|"cache"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --is-enabled | --no-is-enabled (boolean)
          Indicates whether to enable the distribution.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
