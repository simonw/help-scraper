PUT-ALARM()                                                        PUT-ALARM()



NAME
       put-alarm -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  or updates an alarm, and associates it with the specified met-
       ric.

       An alarm is used to monitor a single metric for one of your  resources.
       When  a metric condition is met, the alarm can notify you by email, SMS
       text message, and a banner displayed on the Amazon  Lightsail  console.
       For more information, see Alarms in Amazon Lightsail .

       When  this  action creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set
       to INSUFFICIENT_DATA . The alarm is then evaluated and its state is set
       appropriately.  Any actions associated with the new state are then exe-
       cuted.

       When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the
       update  completely  overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm.
       The alarm is then evaluated with the updated configuration.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          o NetworkTransmitThroughput

          o BurstCapacityTime

          o BurstCapacityPercentage

       --monitored-resource-name (string)
          The name of the Lightsail resource that will be monitored.

          Instances,  load  balancers,  and  relational databases are the only
          Lightsail resources that can currently be monitored by alarms.

       --comparison-operator (string)
          The arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified statis-
          tic  to  the threshold. The specified statistic value is used as the
          first operand.

          Possible values:

          o GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold

          o GreaterThanThreshold

          o LessThanThreshold

          o LessThanOrEqualToThreshold

       --threshold (double)
          The value against which the specified statistic is compared.

       --evaluation-periods (integer)
          The number of most recent periods over which data is compared to the
          specified  threshold. If you are setting an "M out of N" alarm, this
          value (evaluationPeriods ) is the N.

          If you are setting an alarm that requires that a number of  consecu-
          tive data points be breaching to trigger the alarm, this value spec-
          ifies the rolling period of time in which data points are evaluated.

          Each evaluation period is five minutes long. For example, specify an
          evaluation  period  of 24 to evaluate a metric over a rolling period
          of two hours.

          You can specify a minimum valuation period of 1 (5 minutes),  and  a
          maximum evaluation period of 288 (24 hours).

       --datapoints-to-alarm (integer)
          The  number  of  data  points  that must be not within the specified
          threshold to trigger the alarm. If you are setting an "M out  of  N"
          alarm, this value (datapointsToAlarm ) is the M.

       --treat-missing-data (string)
          Sets how this alarm will handle missing data points.

          An alarm can treat missing data in the following ways:

          o breaching  -  Assume the missing data is not within the threshold.
            Missing data counts towards the number of times the metric is  not
            within the threshold.

          o notBreaching  -  Assume  the missing data is within the threshold.
            Missing data does not count towards the number of times the metric
            is not within the threshold.

          o ignore  -  Ignore  the  missing  data. Maintains the current alarm
            state.

          o missing - Missing data is treated as missing.

          If treatMissingData is not specified, the default behavior of  miss-
          ing is used.

          Possible values:

          o breaching

          o notBreaching

          o ignore

          o missing

       --contact-protocols (list)
          The  contact  protocols  to  use  for the alarm, such as Email , SMS
          (text messaging), or both.

          A notification is sent via the specified contact protocol if notifi-
          cations are enabled for the alarm, and when the alarm is triggered.

          A  notification  is not sent if a contact protocol is not specified,
          if the specified contact protocol is not configured in the  AWS  Re-
          gion,  or  if  notifications are not enabled for the alarm using the
          notificationEnabled paramater.

          Use the CreateContactMethod action to configure a  contact  protocol
          in an AWS Region.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            Email
            SMS

       --notification-triggers (list)
          The alarm states that trigger a notification.

          An alarm has the following possible states:

          o ALARM - The metric is outside of the defined threshold.

          o INSUFFICIENT_DATA  - The alarm has just started, the metric is not
            available, or not enough data is available for the metric  to  de-
            termine the alarm state.

          o OK - The metric is within the defined threshold.

          When  you  specify  a  notification trigger, the ALARM state must be
          specified. The INSUFFICIENT_DATA and OK states can be  specified  in
          addition to the ALARM state.

          o If you specify OK as an alarm trigger, a notification is sent when
            the alarm switches from an ALARM or INSUFFICIENT_DATA alarm  state
            to an OK state. This can be thought of as an all clear alarm noti-
            fication.

          o If you specify INSUFFICIENT_DATA as the alarm trigger, a notifica-
            tion  is  sent  when  the alarm switches from an OK or ALARM alarm
            state to an INSUFFICIENT_DATA state.

          The notification trigger defaults to ALARM if you don't specify this
          parameter.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            OK
            ALARM
            INSUFFICIENT_DATA

       --notification-enabled | --no-notification-enabled (boolean)
          Indicates whether the alarm is enabled.

          Notifications  are  enabled by default if you don't specify this pa-
          rameter.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
