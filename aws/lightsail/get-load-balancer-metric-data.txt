NAME
       get-load-balancer-metric-data -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about health metrics for your Lightsail load bal-
       ancer.

       Metrics report the utilization of your resources, and the error  counts
       generated  by  them. Monitor and collect metric data regularly to main-
       tain the reliability, availability, and performance of your resources.

       --statistics (list)
          The statistic for the metric.

          The following statistics are available:

          o Minimum  -  The lowest value observed during the specified period.
            Use this value to determine low volumes of activity for  your  ap-
            plication.

          o Maximum  - The highest value observed during the specified period.
            Use this value to determine high volumes of activity for your  ap-
            plication.

          o Sum - All values submitted for the matching metric added together.
            You can use this statistic to determine the total volume of a met-
            ric.

          o Average  - The value of Sum / SampleCount during the specified pe-
            riod. By comparing this statistic with  the  Minimum  and  Maximum
            values, you can determine the full scope of a metric and how close
            the average use is to the Minimum and Maximum values. This compar-
            ison  helps  you  to  know  when  to increase or decrease your re-
            sources.

          o SampleCount - The count, or number, of data points  used  for  the
            statistical calculation.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            Minimum
            Maximum
            Sum
            Average
            SampleCount

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
