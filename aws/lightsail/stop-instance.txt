STOP-INSTANCE()                                                STOP-INSTANCE()



NAME
       stop-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops a specific Amazon Lightsail instance that is currently running.

       NOTE:
          When you start a stopped instance, Lightsail assigns a new public IP
          address to the instance. To use the same IP address  after  stopping
          and  starting  an instance, create a static IP address and attach it
          to the instance. For more information, see the Amazon Lightsail  De-
          veloper Guide .

       The  stop  instance operation supports tag-based access control via re-
       source tags applied to the resource identified by instance name  .  For
       more information, see the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            stop-instance
          --instance-name <value>
          [--force | --no-force]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-name (string)
          The name of the instance (a virtual private server) to stop.

       --force | --no-force (boolean)
          When  set  to  True , forces a Lightsail instance that is stuck in a
          stopping state to stop.

          WARNING:
              Only use the force parameter if your instance is  stuck  in  the
              stopping  state.  In  any other state, your instance should stop
              normally without adding this parameter to your API request.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
