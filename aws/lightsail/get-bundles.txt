GET-BUNDLES()                                                    GET-BUNDLES()



NAME
       get-bundles -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  list of bundles that are available for purchase. A bundle
       describes the specs for your virtual private server (or instance ).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-bundles is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: bundles

SYNOPSIS
            get-bundles
          [--include-inactive | --no-include-inactive]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --include-inactive | --no-include-inactive (boolean)
          A  Boolean  value  that indicates whether to include inactive bundle
          results in your request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       bundles -> (list)
          An  array  of  key-value  pairs  that contains information about the
          available bundles.

          (structure)
              Describes a bundle, which is a set of specs describing your vir-
              tual private server (or instance ).

              price -> (float)
                 The price in US dollars (e.g., 5.0 ) of the bundle.

              cpuCount -> (integer)
                 The number of vCPUs included in the bundle (e.g., 2 ).

              diskSizeInGb -> (integer)
                 The size of the SSD (e.g., 30 ).

              bundleId -> (string)
                 The bundle ID (e.g., micro_1_0 ).

              instanceType -> (string)
                 The Amazon EC2 instance type (e.g., t2.micro ).

              isActive -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean value indicating whether the bundle is active.

              name -> (string)
                 A friendly name for the bundle (e.g., Micro ).

              power -> (integer)
                 A  numeric  value  that  represents  the  power of the bundle
                 (e.g., 500 ). You can use the bundle's power  value  in  con-
                 junction  with a blueprint's minimum power value to determine
                 whether the blueprint will run on the  bundle.  For  example,
                 you need a bundle with a power value of 500 or more to create
                 an instance that uses a blueprint with a minimum power  value
                 of 500.

              ramSizeInGb -> (float)
                 The amount of RAM in GB (e.g., 2.0 ).

              transferPerMonthInGb -> (integer)
                 The data transfer rate per month in GB (e.g., 2000 ).

              supportedPlatforms -> (list)
                 The  operating  system  platform (Linux/Unix-based or Windows
                 Server-based) that the bundle supports. You can only launch a
                 WINDOWS bundle on a blueprint that supports the WINDOWS plat-
                 form. LINUX_UNIX blueprints require a LINUX_UNIX bundle.

                 (string)

       nextPageToken -> (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of results from your request.

          A next page token is not returned if there are no  more  results  to
          display.

          To  get the next page of results, perform another GetBundles request
          and specify the next page token using the pageToken parameter.
