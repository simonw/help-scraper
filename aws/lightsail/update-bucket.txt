NAME
       update-bucket -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates an existing Amazon Lightsail bucket.

       Use this action to update the configuration of an existing bucket, such
       as versioning, public accessibility, and the AWS accounts that can  ac-
       cess the bucket.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-bucket
          --bucket-name <value>
          [--access-rules <value>]
          [--versioning <value>]
          [--readonly-access-accounts <value>]
          [--access-log-config <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket-name (string)
          The name of the bucket to update.

       --access-rules (structure)
          An object that sets the public accessibility of objects in the spec-
          ified bucket.

          getObject -> (string)
              Specifies the anonymous access to all objects in a bucket.

              The following options can be specified:

              o public - Sets all objects in the bucket to public (read-only),
                making  them readable by anyone in the world. If the getObject
                value is set to public , then all objects in  the  bucket  de-
                fault to public regardless of the allowPublicOverrides value.

              o private  -  Sets  all objects in the bucket to private, making
                them readable only by you or anyone you give access to. If the
                getObject  value  is set to private , and the allowPublicOver-
                rides value is set to true , then all objects  in  the  bucket
                default  to  private  unless  they  are configured with a pub-
                lic-read ACL. Individual objects with a  public-read  ACL  are
                readable by anyone in the world.

          allowPublicOverrides -> (boolean)
              A  Boolean  value that indicates whether the access control list
              (ACL) permissions that are applied to individual  objects  over-
              ride the getObject option that is currently specified.

              When  this  is  true, you can use the PutObjectAcl Amazon S3 API
              action to set individual objects to public (read-only) using the
              public-read ACL, or to private using the private ACL.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          getObject=string,allowPublicOverrides=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "getObject": "public"|"private",
            "allowPublicOverrides": true|false
          }

       --versioning (string)
          Specifies  whether to enable or suspend versioning of objects in the
          bucket.

          The following options can be specified:

          o Enabled - Enables versioning of objects in the specified bucket.

          o Suspended -  Suspends  versioning  of  objects  in  the  specified
            bucket. Existing object versions are retained.

       --readonly-access-accounts (list)
          An  array  of strings to specify the AWS account IDs that can access
          the bucket.

          You can give a maximum of 10 AWS accounts access to a bucket.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --access-log-config (structure)
          An object that  describes  the  access  log  configuration  for  the
          bucket.

          enabled -> (boolean)
              A  Boolean value that indicates whether bucket access logging is
              enabled for the bucket.

          destination -> (string)
              The name of the bucket where the access logs are saved. The des-
              tination  can  be a Lightsail bucket in the same account, and in
              the same AWS Region as the source bucket.

              NOTE:
                 This parameter is required when enabling the access log for a
                 bucket, and should be omitted when disabling the access log.

          prefix -> (string)
              The optional object prefix for the bucket access log.

              The  prefix is an optional addition to the object key that orga-
              nizes your access log files in the destination bucket. For exam-
              ple,  if  you  specify a logs/ prefix, then each log object will
              begin  with  the  logs/  prefix  in  its   key   (for   example,
              logs/2021-11-01-21-32-16-E568B2907131C0C0 ).

              NOTE:
                 This  parameter can be optionally specified when enabling the
                 access log for a bucket, and should be omitted when disabling
                 the access log.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          enabled=boolean,destination=string,prefix=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "enabled": true|false,
            "destination": "string",
            "prefix": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       bucket -> (structure)
          An object that describes the bucket that is updated.

          resourceType -> (string)
              The Lightsail resource type of the bucket (for  example,  Bucket
              ).

          accessRules -> (structure)
              An object that describes the access rules of the bucket.

              getObject -> (string)
                 Specifies the anonymous access to all objects in a bucket.

                 The following options can be specified:

                 o public   -  Sets  all  objects  in  the  bucket  to  public
                   (read-only), making them readable by anyone in  the  world.
                   If  the getObject value is set to public , then all objects
                   in the bucket default to public regardless of the allowPub-
                   licOverrides value.

                 o private - Sets all objects in the bucket to private, making
                   them readable only by you or anyone you give access to.  If
                   the getObject value is set to private , and the allowPubli-
                   cOverrides value is set to true , then all objects  in  the
                   bucket default to private unless they are configured with a
                   public-read ACL. Individual objects with a public-read  ACL

                 list (ACL) permissions that are applied to individual objects
                 override the getObject option that is currently specified.

                 When this is true, you can use the PutObjectAcl Amazon S3 API
                 action to set individual objects to public (read-only)  using
                 the public-read ACL, or to private using the private ACL.
