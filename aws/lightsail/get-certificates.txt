GET-CERTIFICATES()                                          GET-CERTIFICATES()



NAME
       get-certificates -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about one or more Amazon Lightsail SSL/TLS certifi-
       cates.

       NOTE:
          To get a summary of a certificate,  ommit  includeCertificateDetails
          from  your  request.  The response will include only the certificate
          Amazon Resource Name (ARN), certificate name, domain name, and tags.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-certificates
          [--certificate-statuses <value>]
          [--include-certificate-details | --no-include-certificate-details]
          [--certificate-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-statuses (list)
          The status of the certificates for which to return information.

          For example, specify ISSUED to return only certificates with an  IS-
          SUED status.

          When  omitted, the response includes all of your certificates in the
          AWS Region where the request is made, regardless  of  their  current
          status.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            PENDING_VALIDATION
            ISSUED
            INACTIVE
            EXPIRED
            VALIDATION_TIMED_OUT
            REVOKED
            FAILED

       --include-certificate-details | --no-include-certificate-details (bool-
       ean)
          Indicates whether to include detailed information about the certifi-
          cates in the response.

          When omitted, the response includes only the certificate names, Ama-
          zon Resource Names (ARNs), domain names, and tags.

       --certificate-name (string)
          The name for the certificate for which to return information.

          When omitted, the response includes all of your certificates in  the
          AWS Region where the request is made.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     The following failure reasons are possible:

                     o

                       **
                       NO_AVAILABLE_CONTACTS **  -  This  failure  applies  to
                       email  validation, which is not available for Lightsail
                       certificates.

                     o

                       **
                       ADDITIONAL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED  **  -  Lightsail  re-
                       quires  additional information to process this certifi-
                       cate request. This can  happen  as  a  fraud-protection
                       measure, such as when the domain ranks within the Alexa
                       top 1000 websites. To provide the required information,
                       use the AWS Support Center to contact AWS Support.

                     NOTE:
                        You  cannot request a certificate for Amazon-owned do-
                        main names such  as  those  ending  in  amazonaws.com,
                        cloudfront.net, or elasticbeanstalk.com.

                     o

                       **
                       DOMAIN_NOT_ALLOWED ** - One or more of the domain names
                       in the certificate request was reported  as  an  unsafe
                       domain  by  VirusTotal . To correct the problem, search
                       for your domain name on the VirusTotal website. If your
                       domain  is  reported as suspicious, see Google Help for
                       Hacked Websites to learn what you can do.  If  you  be-
                       lieve  that  the result is a false positive, notify the
                       organization that is reporting the  domain.  VirusTotal
                       is  an  aggregate of several antivirus and URL scanners
                       and cannot remove your domain from a block list itself.
                       After  you  correct the problem and the VirusTotal reg-
                       istry has been updated, request a new  certificate.  If
                       you  see  this error and your domain is not included in
                       the VirusTotal list, visit the AWS Support  Center  and
                       create a case.

                     o

                       **
                       INVALID_PUBLIC_DOMAIN  **  -  One or more of the domain
                       names in the certificate request is  not  valid.  Typi-
                       cally,  this is because a domain name in the request is
                       not a valid top-level domain. Try to request a certifi-
                       cate  again,  correcting  any  spelling errors or typos
                       that were in the failed request, and  ensure  that  all
                       domain names in the request are for valid top-level do-
                       mains. For example, you cannot  request  a  certificate
                       for  example.invalidpublicdomain because invalidpublic-
                       domain is not a valid top-level domain.

                     o

                       **
                       OTHER ** - Typically, this failure occurs when there is
                       a  typographical  error  in  one  or more of the domain
                       names in the certificate request. Try to request a cer-
                       tificate again, correcting any spelling errors or typos
                       that were in the failed request.

                 notAfter -> (timestamp)
                     The timestamp when the certificate expires.

                 eligibleToRenew -> (string)
                     The renewal eligibility of the certificate.

                               certificate.

                          automatically validate the domain names of the  cer-
                          tificate. No further action is required.

                        o

                          tificate. You must take action to validate these do-
                          main names or  the  certificate  won't  be  renewed.
                          Check to make sure your certificate's domain valida-
                          tion records exist in your domain's  DNS,  and  that

                          validated, and Lightsail renewed the certificate. No
