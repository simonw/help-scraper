CREATE-LOAD-BALANCER-TLS-CERTIFICATE()  CREATE-LOAD-BALANCER-TLS-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       create-load-balancer-tls-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an SSL/TLS certificate for an Amazon Lightsail load balancer.

       TLS  is  just  an  updated,  more secure version of Secure Socket Layer
       (SSL).

       The CreateLoadBalancerTlsCertificate operation supports  tag-based  ac-
       cess  control  via  resource tags applied to the resource identified by
       load balancer name . For more information, see the Amazon Lightsail De-
       veloper Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-load-balancer-tls-certificate
          --load-balancer-name <value>
          --certificate-name <value>
          --certificate-domain-name <value>
          [--certificate-alternative-names <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-name (string)
          The load balancer name where you want to create the SSL/TLS certifi-
          cate.

       --certificate-name (string)
          The SSL/TLS certificate name.

          You can have up to 10 certificates in your account at one time. Each
          Lightsail  load  balancer  can  have up to 2 certificates associated
          with it at one time. There is also an overall limit to the number of
          certificates  that can be issue in a 365-day period. For more infor-
          mation, see Limits .

       --certificate-domain-name (string)
          The domain name (e.g., example.com ) for your SSL/TLS certificate.

       --certificate-alternative-names (list)
          An array of strings listing alternative domains and  subdomains  for
          your  SSL/TLS certificate. Lightsail will de-dupe the names for you.
          You can have a maximum of 9 alternative names (in addition to the  1
          primary domain). We do not support wildcards (e.g., *.example.com ).

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          The  tag keys and optional values to add to the resource during cre-
          ate.

          Use the TagResource action to tag a resource after it's created.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag key and optional value  assigned  to  an  Amazon
              Lightsail resource.

              For  more  information  about  tags in Lightsail, see the Amazon
              Lightsail Developer Guide .

              key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

                 Constraints: Tag keys accept a maximum of 128  letters,  num-
                 bers, spaces in UTF-8, or the following characters: + - = . _
                 : / @

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

                 Constraints: Tag values accept a maximum of 256 letters, num-
                 bers, spaces in UTF-8, or the following characters: + - = . _
                 : / @

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a TLS certificate for a load balancer

       The  following  create-load-balancer-tls-certificate  example creates a
       TLS certificate that is attached to the specified  load  balancer.  The
       certificate  created  applies to the specified domains.  Note: Only two
       certificates can be created for a load balancer.

          aws lightsail create-load-balancer-tls-certificate \
              --certificate-alternative-names abc.example.com \
              --certificate-domain-name example.com \
              --certificate-name MySecondCertificate \
              --load-balancer-name MyFirstLoadBalancer
