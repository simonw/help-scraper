NAME
       create-relational-database-from-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new  database  from an existing database snapshot in Amazon
       Lightsail.

       You can create a new database from a  snapshot  in  if  something  goes
       wrong with your original database, or to change it to a different plan,
       such as a high availability or standard plan.

       The  create  relational  database  from  snapshot  operation   supports
       tag-based  access control via request tags and resource tags applied to
       the resource identified by relationalDatabaseSnapshotName. For more in-
       formation, see the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          [--relational-database-bundle-id <value>]
          [--source-relational-database-name <value>]
          [--restore-time <value>]
          [--use-latest-restorable-time | --no-use-latest-restorable-time]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --relational-database-name (string)
          The name to use for your new Lightsail database resource.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 2 to 255 alphanumeric characters, or hyphens.

          o The first and last character must be a letter or number.

       --availability-zone (string)
          The  Availability Zone in which to create your new database. Use the
          us-east-2a case-sensitive format.

          You can get a list of Availability Zones by using  the  get  regions
          operation. Be sure to add the include relational database Availabil-
          ity Zones parameter to your request.

       --publicly-accessible | --no-publicly-accessible (boolean)
          Specifies the accessibility options for your new database.  A  value
          of  true specifies a database that is available to resources outside
          of your Lightsail account. A value of  false  specifies  a  database
          that  is  available only to your Lightsail resources in the same re-
          gion as your database.

       --relational-database-snapshot-name (string)
          The name of the database snapshot from  which  to  create  your  new
          database.

       --relational-database-bundle-id (string)
          The  bundle ID for your new database. A bundle describes the perfor-
          mance specifications for your database.

          You can get a list of database bundle IDs by  using  the  get  rela-
          tional database bundles operation.

          When  creating  a  new database from a snapshot, you cannot choose a
          bundle that is smaller than the bundle of the source database.

       --source-relational-database-name (string)
          The name of the source database.

       --restore-time (timestamp)
          The date and time to restore your database from.

          Constraints:

          o Must be before the latest restorable time for the database.

          o Cannot be specified if the use latest restorable time parameter is
            true .

          o Specified in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          o Specified in the Unix time format. For example, if you wish to use
            a restore time of October 1, 2018, at 8 PM  UTC,  then  you  input
            1538424000 as the restore time.

       --use-latest-restorable-time  |  --no-use-latest-restorable-time (bool-
       ean)
          Specifies whether your database is restored from the  latest  backup
          time. A value of true restores from the latest backup time.

          Default: false

          Constraints:  Cannot  be  specified if the restore time parameter is
          provided.

       --tags (list)
          The tag keys and optional values to add to the resource during  cre-
          ate.

          Use the TagResource action to tag a resource after it's created.

          (structure)
              Describes  a  tag  key  and optional value assigned to an Amazon
              Lightsail resource.

              For more information about tags in  Lightsail,  see  the  Amazon
              Lightsail Developer Guide .

              key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

                 Constraints:  Tag  keys accept a maximum of 128 letters, num-
                 bers, spaces in UTF-8, or the following characters: + - = . _
                 : / @

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

                 Constraints: Tag values accept a maximum of 256 letters, num-
                 bers, spaces in UTF-8, or the following characters: + - = . _
                 : / @

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To create a managed database from a snapshot

       The following create-relational-database-from-snapshot example  creates
       a managed database from the specified snapshot in the specified AWS Re-
       gion and Availability Zone, using the $15 USD standard database bundle.
       Note: The bundle that you specify must be equal to or greater in speci-
       fications than the bundle of the original source database used to  cre-
       ate the snapshot.
