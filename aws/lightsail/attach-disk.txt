ATTACH-DISK()                                                    ATTACH-DISK()



NAME
       attach-disk -

DESCRIPTION
       Attaches  a  block  storage  disk to a running or stopped Lightsail in-
       stance and exposes it to the instance with the specified disk name.

       The attach disk operation supports tag-based  access  control  via  re-
       source  tags applied to the resource identified by disk name . For more
       information, see the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            attach-disk
          --disk-name <value>
          --instance-name <value>
          --disk-path <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --disk-name (string)
          The unique Lightsail disk name (e.g., my-disk ).

       --instance-name (string)
          The name of the Lightsail instance where you  want  to  utilize  the
          storage disk.

       --disk-path (string)
          The disk path to expose to the instance (e.g., /dev/xvdf ).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To attach a block storage disk to an instance

       The  following  attach-disk  example  attaches  disk Disk-1 to instance
       WordPress_Multisite-1 with the disk path of /dev/xvdf

          aws lightsail attach-disk \
              --disk-name Disk-1 \
              --disk-path /dev/xvdf \
              --instance-name WordPress_Multisite-1

       Output:
