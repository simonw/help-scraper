CREATE-DOMAIN-ENTRY()                                    CREATE-DOMAIN-ENTRY()



NAME
       create-domain-entry -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  one of the following domain name system (DNS) records in a do-
       main DNS zone: Address (A),  canonical  name  (CNAME),  mail  exchanger
       (MX),  name  server  (NS),  start  of  authority (SOA), service locator
       (SRV), or text (TXT).

       The create domain entry operation supports tag-based access control via
       resource  tags  applied to the resource identified by domain name . For
       more information, see the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-domain-entry
          --domain-name <value>
          --domain-entry <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The domain name (e.g., example.com ) for which you  want  to  create
          the domain entry.

       --domain-entry (structure)
          An  array of key-value pairs containing information about the domain
          entry request.

          id -> (string)
              The ID of the domain recordset entry.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the domain.

          target -> (string)
              The target IP address (e.g., 192.0.2.0 ),  or  AWS  name  server
              (e.g., ns-111.awsdns-22.com. ).

              For   Lightsail   load   balancers,   the   value   looks   like
              ab1234c56789c6b86aba6fb203d443bc-123456789.us-east-2.elb.amazon-
              aws.com  . For Lightsail distributions, the value looks like ex-
              ampled1182ne.cloudfront.net . For Lightsail container  services,
              the      value      looks     like     container-service-1.exam-
              ple23scljs.us-west-2.cs.amazonlightsail.com . Be  sure  to  also
              set  isAlias to true when setting up an A record for a Lightsail
              load balancer, distribution, or container service.

          isAlias -> (boolean)
              When true , specifies whether the domain entry is an alias  used
              by  the  Lightsail  load  balancer.  You can include an alias (A
              type) record in your request, which points to  a  load  balancer
              DNS name and routes traffic to your load balancer.

          type -> (string)
              The  type of domain entry, such as address for IPv4 (A), address
              for IPv6 (AAAA), canonical name (CNAME),  mail  exchanger  (MX),
              name  server  (NS),  start  of  authority (SOA), service locator
              (SRV), or text (TXT).

              The following domain entry types can be used:

              o A

              o AAAA

              o CNAME

              o MX

              o NS

              o SOA

              o SRV

              o TXT

          options -> (map)
              (Deprecated) The options for the domain entry.

              NOTE:
                 In releases prior to November 29, 2017,  this  parameter  was
                 not included in the API response. It is now deprecated.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          id=string,name=string,target=string,isAlias=boolean,type=string,options={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "id": "string",
            "name": "string",
            "target": "string",
            "isAlias": true|false,
            "type": "string",
            "options": {"string": "string"
              ...}
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a domain entry (DNS record)

       The following create-domain-entry example creates a DNS record (A)  for
       the  apex  of  the specified domain that points to an instance's IP ad-
       dress.

       Note: Lightsail's domain-related API operations are available  in  only
       the  us-east-1  Region. If your CLI profile is configured to use a dif-
       ferent Region, you must include the --region us-east-1 parameter or the
       command fails.

          aws lightsail create-domain-entry \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --domain-name example.com \
              --domain-entry name=example.com,type=A,target=192.0.2.0

       Output:

          {
              "operation": {
                  "id": "5be4494d-56f4-41fc-8730-693dcd0ef9e2",
                  "resourceName": "example.com",
                  "resourceType": "Domain",
                  "createdAt": 1569865296.519,
                  "location": {
                      "availabilityZone": "all",
                      "regionName": "global"
                  },
                  "isTerminal": true,
                  "operationType": "CreateDomainEntry",
                  "status": "Succeeded",
                  "statusChangedAt": 1569865296.519
              }
          }
