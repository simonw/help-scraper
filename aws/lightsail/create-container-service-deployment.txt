NAME
       create-container-service-deployment -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a deployment for your Amazon Lightsail container service.

       A deployment specifies the containers that will be launched on the con-
       tainer service and their settings, such as the ports to open, the envi-
       ronment  variables  to  apply,  and  the launch command to run. It also
       specifies the container that will serve as the public endpoint  of  the
       deployment and its settings, such as the HTTP or HTTPS port to use, and
       the health check configuration.

       You can deploy containers to your container service using container im-
       ages from a public registry such as Amazon ECR Public, or from your lo-
       cal machine. For more information, see Creating  container  images  for
       your Amazon Lightsail container services in the Amazon Lightsail Devel-
       oper Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            create-container-service-deployment
          --service-name <value>
          [--containers <value>]
          [--public-endpoint <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-name (string)
          The name of the container service for which to  create  the  deploy-
          ment.

       --containers (map)
          An object that describes the settings of the containers that will be
          launched on the container service.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Describes the settings of a container that will be launched,  or
              that is launched, to an Amazon Lightsail container service.

              image -> (string)
                 The name of the image used for the container.

                 Container  images  sourced from your Lightsail container ser-
                 vice, that are registered and stored on your  service,  start
                 with  a  colon  (:  ). For example, if your container service
                 name is container-service-1 , the container  image  label  is
                 mystaticsite  , and you want to use the third (3 ) version of
                 the registered container image, then you should specify :con-
                 tainer-service-1.mystaticsite.3  .  To use the latest version
                 of a container image, specify latest  instead  of  a  version
                 number (for example, :container-service-1.mystaticsite.latest
                 ). Lightsail will automatically use the highest numbered ver-
                 sion of the registered container image.

                 Container  images  sourced from a public registry like Docker
                 Hub don't start with a colon. For  example,  nginx:latest  or
                 nginx .

              command -> (list)
                 The launch command for the container.

                 (string)

              environment -> (map)

                 value -> (string)

              ports -> (map)
                 The open firewall ports of the container.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                   a time.

                 o Inactive  - The deployment was previously successfully cre-
                   ated, but it is not currently running on the container ser-
                   vice.

                 o Failed - The deployment failed. Use the GetContainerLog ac-
                   tion to view the log events for the containers in  the  de-

                        between 2 and 60 seconds. The default value is 2 .

                     intervalSeconds -> (integer)
                        The  approximate  interval, in seconds, between health
                        checks of an individual container. You can specify be-
                        tween 5 and 300 seconds. The default value is 5 .

                        response  from a container. You can specify values be-
                        tween 200 and 499 . You can  specify  multiple  values
                        (for  example, 200,202 ) or a range of values (for ex-
                        ample, 200-299 ).

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp when the deployment was created.

          nextDeployment -> (structure)
              An object that describes the next deployment  of  the  container
              service.

              This  value  is  null  when  there is no deployment in a pending
              state.

              version -> (integer)
                 The version number of the deployment.

              state -> (string)
                 The state of the deployment.

                 A deployment can be in one of the following states:

                 o Activating - The deployment is being created.

                 o Active - The deployment was successfully created, and  it's
                   currently  running  on the container service. The container
                   service can have only one deployment in an active state  at
                   a time.

                 o Inactive  - The deployment was previously successfully cre-
                   ated, but it is not currently running on the container ser-
                   vice.

                 o Failed - The deployment failed. Use the GetContainerLog ac-
                   tion to view the log events for the containers in  the  de-
                   ployment to try to determine the reason for the failure.

              containers -> (map)
                 An object that describes the configuration for the containers
                 of the deployment.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     Describes the  settings  of  a  container  that  will  be
                     launched,  or  that  is  launched, to an Amazon Lightsail
                     container service.

                     image -> (string)
                        The name of the image used for the container.

                        Container images sourced from your Lightsail container
                        service,  that  are registered and stored on your ser-
                        vice, start with a colon (: ). For  example,  if  your
                        container  service  name  is container-service-1 , the
                        container image label is mystaticsite , and  you  want
                        to  use  the third (3 ) version of the registered con-
                        tainer image, then you should specify  :container-ser-
                        vice-1.mystaticsite.3 . To use the latest version of a
                        container image, specify latest instead of  a  version
                        number  (for  example,  :container-service-1.mystatic-
                        site.latest ). Lightsail will  automatically  use  the
                        highest  numbered  version of the registered container
                        image.

                        Container images sourced from a public  registry  like
                        Docker  Hub don't start with a colon. For example, ng-
                        inx:latest or nginx .

                     command -> (list)
                        The launch command for the container.

                     The  port  of the specified container to which traffic is
                     forwarded to.

                 healthCheck -> (structure)
                     An object that describes the health  check  configuration
                     of the container.

                     healthyThreshold -> (integer)
                        The  number of consecutive health checks successes re-
                        quired before moving  the  container  to  the  Healthy
                        state. The default value is 2 .

                     unhealthyThreshold -> (integer)
                        The  number  of  consecutive health check failures re-
                        quired before moving the container  to  the  Unhealthy
                        state. The default value is 2 .

                     timeoutSeconds -> (integer)
                        The  amount  of  time, in seconds, during which no re-
                        sponse means a failed health check.  You  can  specify
                        between 2 and 60 seconds. The default value is 2 .

                     intervalSeconds -> (integer)
                        The  approximate  interval, in seconds, between health
                        checks of an individual container. You can specify be-
                        tween 5 and 300 seconds. The default value is 5 .

                     path -> (string)

                        health check. The default value is / .

                     successCodes -> (string)
                        The HTTP codes to use when checking for  a  successful
                        response  from a container. You can specify values be-
                        tween 200 and 499 . You can  specify  multiple  values
                        (for  example, 200,202 ) or a range of values (for ex-
                        ample, 200-299 ).

              createdAt -> (timestamp)

          isDisabled -> (boolean)
              A Boolean value indicating whether the container service is dis-
              abled.

          principalArn -> (string)
              The principal ARN of the container service.

              The principal ARN can be used to create a trust relationship be-
              tween your standard Amazon Web Services account and your  Light-
              sail  container  service.  This  allows you to give your service
              permission to access resources in your standard Amazon Web  Ser-
              vices account.

          privateDomainName -> (string)
              The private domain name of the container service.

              The  private  domain  name is accessible only by other resources
              within the default virtual private cloud (VPC) of your Lightsail
              account.

          publicDomainNames -> (map)
              The  public  domain name of the container service, such as exam-
              ple.com and www.example.com .

              You can specify up to four public domain names for  a  container
              service.  The  domain  names  that you specify are used when you
              create a deployment with a container configured  as  the  public
              endpoint of your container service.

              If  you  don't specify public domain names, then you can use the
              default domain of the container service.

              WARNING:
                 You must create and validate an  SSL/TLS  certificate  before
                 you  can use public domain names with your container service.
                 Use the CreateCertificate action to create a certificate  for
                 the  public  domain names you want to use with your container
                 service.

              See CreateContainerService or UpdateContainerService for  infor-
              mation  about how to specify public domain names for your Light-
              sail container service.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (list)
                 (string)

          url -> (string)
              The publicly accessible URL of the container service.

              If no public endpoint is specified in  the  currentDeployment  ,
              this URL returns a 404 response.
