DELETE-LOAD-BALANCER()                                  DELETE-LOAD-BALANCER()



NAME
       delete-load-balancer -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  Lightsail load balancer and all its associated SSL/TLS cer-
       tificates. Once the load balancer is deleted, you will need to create a
       new  load  balancer, create a new certificate, and verify domain owner-
       ship again.

       The delete load balancer operation supports  tag-based  access  control
       via  resource  tags applied to the resource identified by load balancer
       name . For more information, see the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-load-balancer
          --load-balancer-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-name (string)
          The name of the load balancer you want to delete.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       The  following  delete-load-balancer example deletes the specified load
       balancer and any associated TLS certificates.
