SET-IP-ADDRESS-TYPE()                                    SET-IP-ADDRESS-TYPE()



NAME
       set-ip-address-type -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets the IP address type for an Amazon Lightsail resource.

       Use this action to enable dual-stack for a resource, which enables IPv4
       and IPv6 for the specified resource. Alternately, you can use this  ac-
       tion to disable dual-stack, and enable IPv4 only.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       --ip-address-type (string)
          The IP address type to set for the specified resource.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
