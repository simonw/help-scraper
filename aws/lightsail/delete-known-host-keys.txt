DELETE-KNOWN-HOST-KEYS()                              DELETE-KNOWN-HOST-KEYS()



NAME
       delete-known-host-keys -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the known host key or certificate used by the Amazon Lightsail
       browser-based SSH or RDP clients to authenticate an instance. This  op-
       eration  enables the Lightsail browser-based SSH or RDP clients to con-
       nect to the instance after a host key mismatch.

       WARNING:
          Perform this operation only if you were expecting the  host  key  or
          certificate mismatch or if you are familiar with the new host key or
          certificate   on   the   instance.   For   more   information,   see
          Troubleshooting  connection  issues  when using the Amazon Lightsail
          browser-based SSH or RDP client .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-known-host-keys
          --instance-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-name (string)
          The name of the instance for which you want to reset the host key or
          certificate.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete known host keys from an instance

       The following delete-known-host-keys example deletes the known host key
       from the specified instance.

          aws lightsail delete-known-host-keys \
              --instance-name Instance-1
