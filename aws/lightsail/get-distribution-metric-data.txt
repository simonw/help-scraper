NAME
       get-distribution-metric-data -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  data  points of a specific metric for an Amazon Lightsail
       content delivery network (CDN) distribution.

       Metrics report the utilization of your resources, and the error  counts
       generated  by  them. Monitor and collect metric data regularly to main-
       tain the reliability, availability, and performance of your resources.

OPTIONS
       --distribution-name (string)
          The name of the distribution for which to get metric data.

          Use the GetDistributions action to get a list of distribution  names
          that you can specify.

       --metric-name (string)
          The metric for which you want to return information.

          Valid  distribution  metric  names  are listed below, along with the
          most useful statistics to include in your request, and the published
          unit value.

            **
            Requests ** - The total number of viewer requests received by your
            Lightsail distribution, for all HTTP methods, and  for  both  HTTP
            and HTTPS requests.  Statistics : The most useful statistic is Sum
            .  Unit : The published unit is None .

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 90)
            Inline strong start-string without end-string.

          o

            **
            BytesDownloaded ** - The number of bytes downloaded by viewers for
            GET,  HEAD,  and  OPTIONS  requests.  Statistics : The most useful
            statistic is Sum .  Unit : The published unit is None .

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 92)
            Inline strong start-string without end-string.

          o

            **
            BytesUploaded ** - The number of bytes uploaded to your origin  by
            your Lightsail distribution, using POST and PUT requests.  Statis-
            tics : The most useful statistic is Sum .  Unit  :  The  published
            unit is None .

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 94)
            Inline strong start-string without end-string.

          o

            **
            TotalErrorRate  **  -  The  percentage  of all viewer requests for
            which the response's HTTP status code was 4xx or 5xx.   Statistics
            :  The  most  useful  statistic is Average .  Unit : The published
            unit is Percent .

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 96)

          o

            **
            4xxErrorRate ** - The percentage of all viewer requests for  which
            the response's HTTP status cod was 4xx. In these cases, the client
            or client viewer may have made an error.  For  example,  a  status
            code  of 404 (Not Found) means that the client requested an object
            that could not be found.  Statistics : The most  useful  statistic
            is Average .  Unit : The published unit is Percent .

            5xxErrorRate  ** - The percentage of all viewer requests for which
            the response's HTTP status code was 5xx. In these cases, the  ori-
            gin  server  did  not  satisfy the requests. For example, a status
            code of 503 (Service Unavailable) means that the origin server  is
            currently  unavailable.  Statistics : The most useful statistic is
            Average .  Unit : The published unit is Percent .

          returned.

       --unit (string)
          The unit for the metric data request.

       --statistics (list)
          The statistic for the metric.

          The following statistics are available:

          o Minimum - The lowest value observed during the  specified  period.
            Use  this  value to determine low volumes of activity for your ap-
            plication.

          o Maximum - The highest value observed during the specified  period.
            Use  this value to determine high volumes of activity for your ap-
            plication.

          o Sum - All values submitted for the matching metric added together.
            You can use this statistic to determine the total volume of a met-
            ric.

          o Average - The value of Sum / SampleCount during the specified  pe-
            riod.  By  comparing  this  statistic with the Minimum and Maximum
            values, you can determine the full scope of a metric and how close
            the average use is to the Minimum and Maximum values. This compar-
            ison helps you to know when  to  increase  or  decrease  your  re-
            sources.

          o SampleCount  -  The  count, or number, of data points used for the
            statistical calculation.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            Minimum
            Maximum
            Sum
            Average
            SampleCount

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
