OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The AWS account ID associated with the public registry  the  reposi-
          tory  is  in.  If  you do not specify a registry, the default public

          The name of the repository to create or update the catalog data for.

       --catalog-data (structure)

          description -> (string)
              A short description of the contents of the repository. This text
              appears in both the image details and also  when  searching  for

          architectures -> (list)
              The  system  architecture  that the images in the repository are
              compatible with. On the Amazon ECR Public Gallery, the following
              supported  architectures will appear as badges on the repository
              and are used as search filters.

              o Linux

              NOTE:
                 If an unsupported tag is added  to  your  repository  catalog
                 data,  it  will  be associated with the repository and can be
                 retrieved using the API but will not be discoverable  in  the
                 Amazon ECR Public Gallery.

              (string)

          operatingSystems -> (list)
              The operating systems that the images in the repository are com-
              patible with. On the Amazon ECR Public  Gallery,  the  following

                 If an unsupported tag is added  to  your  repository  catalog
                 data,  it  will  be associated with the repository and can be
                 retrieved using the API but will not be discoverable  in  the
                 Amazon ECR Public Gallery.

              (string)

          logoImageBlob -> (blob)
              The base64-encoded repository logo payload.

              NOTE:
                 The  repository  logo  is only publicly visible in the Amazon
                 ECR Public Gallery for verified accounts.

          aboutText -> (string)
              A detailed description of the contents of the repository. It  is
              publicly visible in the Amazon ECR Public Gallery. The text must
              be in markdown format.

          usageText -> (string)
              Detailed information on how to use the contents of  the  reposi-
              tory.  It  is publicly visible in the Amazon ECR Public Gallery.
              The usage text provides context, support information, and  addi-
              tional  usage details for users of the repository. The text must
              be in markdown format.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          description=string,architectures=string,string,operatingSystems=string,string,logoImageBlob=blob,aboutText=string,usageText=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "description": "string",
            "architectures": ["string", ...],
            "operatingSystems": ["string", ...],
            "logoImageBlob": blob,
            "aboutText": "string",
            "usageText": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
