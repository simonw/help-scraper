PUT-IMAGE()                                                        PUT-IMAGE()



NAME
       put-image -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  or  updates the image manifest and tags associated with an im-
       age.

       When an image is pushed and all new image layers  have  been  uploaded,
       the  PutImage API is called once to create or update the image manifest
       and the tags associated with the image.

       NOTE:
          This operation is used by the Amazon ECR proxy and is not  generally
          used by customers for pulling and pushing images. In most cases, you
          should use the docker CLI to pull, tag, and push images.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-image
          [--registry-id <value>]
          --repository-name <value>
          --image-manifest <value>
          [--image-manifest-media-type <value>]
          [--image-tag <value>]
          [--image-digest <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The AWS account ID associated with the public registry that contains
          the  repository  in  which to put the image. If you do not specify a
          registry, the default public registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository in which to put the image.

       --image-manifest (string)
          The image manifest corresponding to the image to be uploaded.

       --image-manifest-media-type (string)
          The media type of the image manifest. If you push an image  manifest
          that  does not contain the mediaType field, you must specify the im-
          ageManifestMediaType in the request.

       --image-tag (string)
          The tag to associate with the image. This parameter is required  for
          images  that  use the Docker Image Manifest V2 Schema 2 or Open Con-
          tainer Initiative (OCI) formats.

       --image-digest (string)
          The image digest of the image manifest corresponding to the image.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
