DESCRIBE-IMAGES()                                            DESCRIBE-IMAGES()



NAME
       describe-images -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns metadata about the images in a repository in a public registry.

       NOTE:
          Beginning  with Docker version 1.9, the Docker client compresses im-
          age layers before pushing them to a V2 Docker registry.  The  output
          of  the  docker images command shows the uncompressed image size, so
          it may return a larger image size than the image sizes  returned  by
          DescribeImages .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-images is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: imageDetails

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The AWS account ID associated with the public registry that contains
          the  repository in which to describe images. If you do not specify a
          registry, the default public registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The repository that contains the images to describe.

       --image-ids (list)
          The list of image IDs for the requested repository.

          (structure)
              An object with identifying information for an Amazon ECR image.

              imageDigest -> (string)
                 The sha256 digest of the image manifest.

              imageTag -> (string)
                 The tag used for the image.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          imageDigest=string,imageTag=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "imageDigest": "string",
              "imageTag": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       imageDetails -> (list)
          A list of  ImageDetail objects that contain data about the image.

          (structure)
              An object that describes an image returned by a   DescribeImages
              operation.

                 The  AWS  account  ID  associated with the public registry to

                 The list of tags associated with this image.

                 (string)

              imageSizeInBytes -> (long)
                 The size, in bytes, of the image in the repository.

                 If the image is a manifest list, this will be the max size of
                 all manifests in the list.

                 NOTE:
                     Beginning with Docker version 1.9, the Docker client com-
                     presses image layers before pushing them to a  V2  Docker
                     registry.  The  output of the docker images command shows
                     the uncompressed image size, so it may  return  a  larger
                     image  size than the image sizes returned by  DescribeIm-
                     ages .

              imagePushedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, expressed in standard JavaScript date for-
                 mat, at which the current image was pushed to the repository.

              imageManifestMediaType -> (string)
                 The media type of the image manifest.

              artifactMediaType -> (string)
                 The artifact media type of the image.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  nextToken  value to include in a future DescribeImages request.
          When the results of a DescribeImages  request  exceed  maxResults  ,
          this  value  can  be used to retrieve the next page of results. This
          value is null when there are no more results to return.
