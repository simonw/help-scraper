OPTIONS
       --repository-name (string)
          The  name  to  use  for the repository. This appears publicly in the
          Amazon ECR Public Gallery. The repository name can be  specified  on
          its  own  (for example nginx-web-app ) or prepended with a namespace
          to group the repository into a category (for  example  project-a/ng-
          inx-web-app ).

       --catalog-data (structure)
          The  details  about  the repository that are publicly visible in the
          Amazon ECR Public Gallery.

          description -> (string)
              A short description of the contents of the repository. This text
              appears  in  both  the image details and also when searching for
              repositories on the Amazon ECR Public Gallery.

          architectures -> (list)
              The system architecture that the images in  the  repository  are
              compatible with. On the Amazon ECR Public Gallery, the following
              supported architectures appear as badges on the  repository  and
              are used as search filters.

              NOTE:
                 If  an  unsupported  tag  is added to your repository catalog
                 data, it's associated with the  repository  and  can  be  re-
                 trieved  using  the  API but isn't discoverable in the Amazon
                 ECR Public Gallery.

              itory. It's publicly visible in the Amazon ECR  Public  Gallery.
              The  usage text provides context, support information, and addi-
              tional usage details for users of the repository. The text  must
              be in markdown format.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          description=string,architectures=string,string,operatingSystems=string,string,logoImageBlob=blob,aboutText=string,usageText=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "description": "string",
            "architectures": ["string", ...],
            "operatingSystems": ["string", ...],
            "logoImageBlob": blob,
            "aboutText": "string",
            "usageText": "string"
          }

       --tags (list)
          The  metadata  that  you apply to each repository to help categorize
          and organize your repositories. Each tag consists of a  key  and  an
          optional value. You define both of them. Tag keys can have a maximum
          character length of 128 characters, and tag values can have a  maxi-
          mum length of 256 characters.

          (structure)
              The metadata that you apply to a resource to help you categorize
              and organize them. Each tag consists of a key  and  an  optional
              value.  You  define  both. Tag keys can have a maximum character
              length of 128 characters, and tag  values  can  have  a  maximum
              length of 256 characters.

              Key -> (string)
                 One  part  of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  optional  part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [

              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

It is designed to provide a stable, secure, and high-performance execution environment for applications running on Amazon EC2. The full distribution includes packages that enable easy integration with AWS, including launch configuration tools and many popular AWS libraries and tools. AWS provides ongoing security and maintenance updates to all instances running Amazon Linux.\n\nThe Amazon Linux container image contains a minimal set of packages. To install additional packages, [use `yum`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/managing-software.html).\n\nAWS provides two versions of Amazon Linux: [Amazon Linux 2](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/) and [Amazon Linux AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/).\n\nFor information on security updates for Amazon Linux, please refer to [Amazon Linux 2 Security Advisories](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/alas2.html) and [Amazon Linux AMI Security Advisories](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/). Note that Docker Hub's vulnerability scanning for Amazon Linux is currently based on RPM versions, which does not reflect the state of backported patches for vulnerabilities.\n\n## Where can I run Amazon Linux container images?\n\nYou can run Amazon Linux container images in any Docker based environment. Examples include, your laptop, in Amazon EC2 instances, and Amazon ECS clusters.\n\n## License\n\nAmazon Linux is available under the [GNU General Public License, version 2.0](https://github.com/aws/amazon-linux-docker-images/blob/master/LICENSE). Individual software packages are available under their own licenses; run `rpm -qi [package name]` or check `/usr/share/doc/[package name]-*` and `/usr/share/licenses/[package name]-*` for details.\n\nAs with all Docker images, these likely also contain other software which may be under other licenses (such as Bash, etc from the base distribution, along with any direct or indirect dependencies of the primary software being contained).\n\nSome additional license information which was able to be auto-detected might be found in [the `repo-info` repository's `amazonlinux/` directory](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info/tree/master/repos/amazonlinux).\n\n## Security\n\nFor information on security updates for Amazon Linux, please refer to [Amazon Linux 2 Security Advisories](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/alas2.html) and [Amazon Linux AMI Security Advisories](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/).

Examples include, your laptop, in Amazon EC2 instances, and ECS clusters.\n\n## How do I install a software package from Extras repository in Amazon Linux 2?\n\nAvailable packages can be listed with the `amazon-linux-extras` command. Packages can be installed with the `amazon-linux-extras install <package>` command. Example: `amazon-linux-extras install rust1`\n\n## Will updates be available for Amazon Linux containers?\n\nSimilar to the Amazon Linux images for Amazon EC2 and on-premises use, Amazon Linux container images will get ongoing updates from Amazon in the form of security updates, bug fix updates, and other enhancements. Security bulletins for Amazon Linux are available at https://alas.aws.amazon.com/\n\n## Will AWS Support the current version of Amazon Linux going forward?\n\nYes; in order to avoid any disruption to your existing applications and to facilitate migration to Amazon Linux 2, AWS will provide regular security updates for Amazon Linux 2018.03 AMI and container image for 2 years after the final LTS build is announced. You can also use all your existing support channels such as AWS Support and Amazon Linux Discussion Forum to continue to submit support requests."

It is designed to provide a stable, secure, and high-performance execution environment for applications running on Amazon EC2. The full distribution includes packages that enable easy integration with AWS, including launch configuration tools and many popular AWS libraries and tools. AWS provides ongoing security and maintenance updates to all instances running Amazon Linux.\n\nThe Amazon Linux container image contains a minimal set of packages. To install additional packages, [use `yum`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/managing-software.html).\n\nAWS provides two versions of Amazon Linux: [Amazon Linux 2](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/) and [Amazon Linux AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/).\n\nFor information on security updates for Amazon Linux, please refer to [Amazon Linux 2 Security Advisories](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/alas2.html) and [Amazon Linux AMI Security Advisories](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/). Note that Docker Hub's vulnerability scanning for Amazon Linux is currently based on RPM versions, which does not reflect the state of backported patches for vulnerabilities.\n\n## Where can I run Amazon Linux container images?\n\nYou can run Amazon Linux container images in any Docker based environment. Examples include, your laptop, in Amazon EC2 instances, and Amazon ECS clusters.\n\n## License\n\nAmazon Linux is available under the [GNU General Public License, version 2.0](https://github.com/aws/amazon-linux-docker-images/blob/master/LICENSE). Individual software packages are available under their own licenses; run `rpm -qi [package name]` or check `/usr/share/doc/[package name]-*` and `/usr/share/licenses/[package name]-*` for details.\n\nAs with all Docker images, these likely also contain other software which may be under other licenses (such as Bash, etc from the base distribution, along with any direct or indirect dependencies of the primary software being contained).\n\nSome additional license information which was able to be auto-detected might be found in [the `repo-info` repository's `amazonlinux/` directory](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info/tree/master/repos/amazonlinux).\n\n## Security\n\nFor information on security updates for Amazon Linux, please refer to [Amazon Linux 2 Security Advisories](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/alas2.html) and [Amazon Linux AMI Security Advisories](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/). Note that Docker Hub's vulnerability scanning for Amazon Linux is currently based on RPM versions, which does not reflect the state of backported patches for vulnerabilities.",
                  "usageText": "## Supported architectures\n\namd64, arm64v8\n\n## Where can I run Amazon Linux container images?\n\nYou can run Amazon Linux container images in any Docker based environment. Examples include, your laptop, in Amazon EC2 instances, and ECS clusters.\n\n## How do I install a software package from Extras repository in Amazon Linux 2?\n\nAvailable packages can be listed with the `amazon-linux-extras` command. Packages can be installed with the `amazon-linux-extras install <package>` command. Example: `amazon-linux-extras install rust1`\n\n## Will updates be available for Amazon Linux containers?\n\nSimilar to the Amazon Linux images for Amazon EC2 and on-premises use, Amazon Linux container images will get ongoing updates from Amazon in the form of security updates, bug fix updates, and other enhancements. Security bulletins for Amazon Linux are available at https://alas.aws.amazon.com/\n\n## Will AWS Support the current version of Amazon Linux going forward?\n\nYes; in order to avoid any disruption to your existing applications and to facilitate migration to Amazon Linux 2, AWS will provide regular security updates for Amazon Linux 2018.03 AMI and container image for 2 years after the final LTS build is announced. You can also use all your existing support channels such as AWS Support and Amazon Linux Discussion Forum to continue to submit support requests."
