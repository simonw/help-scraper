NAME
       get-login-password -

DESCRIPTION
       To log in to an Amazon ECR public registry

       Retrieves  and displays an authentication token using the GetAuthoriza-
       tionToken API that you can use to authenticate to an Amazon ECR  public
       registry.  You can pass the authorization token to the login command of
       the container client of your preference, such as the Docker CLI.  After
       you  have authenticated to an Amazon ECR public registry with this com-
       mand, you can use the client to push and pull images from that registry
       as  long  as your IAM principal has access to do so until the token ex-
       pires. The authorization token is valid for 12 hours. This command  re-
       quires  the 'ecr-public:GetAuthorizationToken' and 'sts:GetServiceBear-
       erToken' permissions.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
