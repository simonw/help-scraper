BATCH-DELETE-IMAGE()                                      BATCH-DELETE-IMAGE()



NAME
       batch-delete-image -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a list of specified images within a repository in a public reg-
       istry. Images are specified with either an imageTag or imageDigest .

       You can remove a tag from an image by specifying  the  image's  tag  in
       your  request. When you remove the last tag from an image, the image is
       deleted from your repository.

       You can completely delete an image (and all of its tags) by  specifying
       the image's digest in your request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-delete-image
          [--registry-id <value>]
          --repository-name <value>
          --image-ids <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The  AWS  account  ID associated with the registry that contains the
          image to delete. If you do not specify a registry, the default  pub-
          lic registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The  repository  in  a  public  registry  that contains the image to
          delete.

       --image-ids (list)
          A list of image ID references that correspond to images  to  delete.
          The  format  of  the  imageIds reference is imageTag=tag or imageDi-
          gest=digest .

          (structure)
              An object with identifying information for an Amazon ECR image.

              imageDigest -> (string)
                 The sha256 digest of the image manifest.

              imageTag -> (string)
                 The tag used for the image.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          imageDigest=string,imageTag=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "imageDigest": "string",
              "imageTag": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT

              imageDigest -> (string)

                 The tag used for the image.

              failureCode -> (string)
