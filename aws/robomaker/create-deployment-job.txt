CREATE-DEPLOYMENT-JOB()                                CREATE-DEPLOYMENT-JOB()



NAME
       create-deployment-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Deploys a specific version of a robot application to robots in a fleet.

       The  robot application must have a numbered applicationVersion for con-
       sistency reasons. To create a new version, use  CreateRobotApplication-
       Version or see Creating a Robot Application Version .

       NOTE:
          After 90 days, deployment jobs expire and will be deleted. They will
          no longer be accessible.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
