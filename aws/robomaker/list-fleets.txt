LIST-FLEETS()                                                    LIST-FLEETS()



NAME
       list-fleets -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of  fleets. You can optionally provide filters to re-
       trieve specific fleets.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-fleets is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: fleetDetails

SYNOPSIS
            list-fleets
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Optional filters to limit results.

          The  filter name name is supported. When filtering, you must use the
          complete value of the filtered item. You can use up  to  three  fil-
          ters.

          (structure)
              Information about a filter.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              values -> (list)
                 A list of values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list fleets

       This example lists fleets. A maximum of 20 fleets will be returned.

       Command:

          aws robomaker list-fleets --max-items 20

       Output:

          {
            "fleetDetails": [
                {
                    "name": "Trek",
                    "arn": "arn:aws:robomaker:us-west-2:111111111111:deployment-fleet/MyFleet/1539894765711",
                    "createdAt": 1539894765.0,
                    "lastDeploymentStatus": "Failed",
                    "lastDeploymentJob": "arn:aws:robomaker:us-west-2:111111111111:deployment-job/deployment-4w4g69p25zdb",
                    "lastDeploymentTime": 1544719763.0
                }
            ]
          }

OUTPUT
       fleetDetails -> (list)
          A list of fleet details meeting the request criteria.

          (structure)
              Information about a fleet.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the fleet.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the fleet.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the fleet was
                 created.

              lastDeploymentStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the last fleet deployment.

              lastDeploymentJob -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the last deployment job.

              lastDeploymentTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time of the last deployment.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  the previous paginated request did not return all of the remain-
          ing results, the response object's nextToken parameter value is  set
          to  a  token.  To  retrieve the next set of results, call ListFleets
          again and assign that token to the request object's nextToken param-
          eter.  If  there are no remaining results, the previous response ob-
          ject's NextToken parameter is set to null.
