OPTIONS
       --jobs (list)
          A  list  of  Amazon  Resource Names (ARNs) of simulation jobs to de-
          scribe.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To batch describe simulation jobs

       The following batch-describe-simulation-job example  retrieves  details
       for the three specified simulation jobs.

       Command:

          aws robomaker batch-describe-simulation-job \
          --job arn:aws:robomaker:us-west-2:111111111111:simulation-job/sim-66bbb3gpxm8x arn:aws:robomaker:us-west-2:111111111111:simulation-job/sim-p0cpdrrwng2n arn:aws:robomaker:us-west-2:111111111111:simulation-job/sim-g8h6tglmblgw

                            specify a list of commands for your container  im-
                            age.

                            If you've specified SimulationRuntime as the value
                            for your SimulationSoftwareSuite  ,  you  can  use

                        (structure)
                            Provides upload configuration  information.  Files
                            are uploaded from the simulation job to a location
                            you specify.

                            name -> (string)

                               loaded in Amazon S3. It is appended to the sim-
                               ulation output location to determine the  final
                               path.

                               For example, if your simulation output location
                               is s3://my-bucket and your upload configuration
                               name  is  robot-test  ,  your files will be up-
                               loaded  to   s3://my-bucket/<simid>/<runid>/ro-
                               bot-test .

                            path -> (string)

                               with  the  addition of ** as a super asterisk .
                               For example, specifying /var/log/**.log  causes
                               all  .log  files in the /var/log directory tree
                               to be collected. For more  examples,  see  Glob
                               Library .

                                   UPLOAD_ON_TERMINATE

                               Matching files are uploaded once the simulation
                               enters the TERMINATING  state.  Matching  files
                               are  not  uploaded  until all of your code (in-
                               cluding tools) have stopped.

                               If there is a problem uploading a file, the up-
                               load  is  retried. If problems persist, no fur-
                               ther upload attempts will be made.
                                   UPLOAD_ROLLING_AUTO_REMOVE

                               Matching files are uploaded as  they  are  cre-
                               ated. They are deleted after they are uploaded.
                               The specified path is checked every 5  seconds.
                               A  final  check  is  made when all of your code
                               (including tools) have stopped.

                     useDefaultUploadConfigurations -> (boolean)
                        A Boolean indicating whether  to  use  default  upload
                        configurations. By default, .ros and .gazebo files are
                        uploaded when the application terminates and  all  ROS
                        topics will be recorded.

                        If you set this value, you must specify an outputLoca-
                        tion .

                               Specifies  the  path  of the file(s) to upload.
                               Standard Unix glob matching rules are accepted,
                               with  the  addition of ** as a super asterisk .
                               For example, specifying /var/log/**.log  causes
                               all  .log  files in the /var/log directory tree
                               to be collected. For more  examples,  see  Glob
                               Library .

                            uploadBehavior -> (string)
                               Specifies when to upload the files:
                                   UPLOAD_ON_TERMINATE

                               Matching files are uploaded once the simulation
                               enters the TERMINATING  state.  Matching  files
                               are  not  uploaded  until all of your code (in-
                               cluding tools) have stopped.

                               If there is a problem uploading a file, the up-
                               load  is  retried. If problems persist, no fur-
                               ther upload attempts will be made.
                                   UPLOAD_ROLLING_AUTO_REMOVE

                               Matching files are uploaded as  they  are  cre-
                               ated. They are deleted after they are uploaded.
                               The specified path is checked every 5  seconds.
                               A  final  check  is  made when all of your code
                               (including tools) have stopped.

                        topics will be recorded.

                               can interact with the tool as it is running  in
                               the  simulation.  It must have a graphical user

                               tool quits running.  RESTART  will  cause  your
                               tool  to be restarted. FAIL will cause your job
                               to exit. The default is RESTART .
