OPTIONS
       --batch (string)
          The id of the batch to describe.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the batch.

       status -> (string)
          The status of the batch.
              Pending

          The simulation job batch request is pending.
              InProgress

          The simulation job batch is in progress.
              Failed

          The simulation job batch failed. One or more simulation job requests
          could not be completed due to an internal failure (like InternalSer-
          viceError ). See failureCode and failureReason for more information.
              Completed

          The  simulation  batch  job  completed. A batch is complete when (1)
          there are no pending simulation job requests in the batch  and  none
          of  the failed simulation job requests are due to InternalServiceEr-
          ror and (2) when all created simulation jobs have reached a terminal
          state (for example, Completed or Failed ).
              Canceled

          The simulation batch job was cancelled.
              Canceling

          The simulation batch job is being cancelled.
              Completing

          The simulation batch job is completing.
              TimingOut

          The simulation job batch is timing out.

          If  a  batch  timing  out,  and there are pending requests that were
          failing due to an internal failure (like InternalServiceError ), the
          batch  status will be Failed . If there are no such failing request,
          the batch status will be TimedOut .
              TimedOut

          The simulation batch job timed out.

       lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the  simulation  job
          batch was last updated.

          timeoutInSeconds -> (long)
              The  amount  of  time, in seconds, to wait for the batch to com-
              plete.

              If a batch times out, and there are pending requests  that  were
              failing due to an internal failure (like InternalServiceError ),
              they will be moved to the failed list and the batch status  will
              be  Failed  . If the pending requests were failing for any other
              reason, the failed pending requests will be moved to the  failed
              list and the batch status will be TimedOut .

          maxConcurrency -> (integer)
              The number of active simulation jobs create as part of the batch
              that can be in an active state at the same time.

              Active  states  include:  Pending  ,``Preparing``  ,  Running  ,

                                   the final path.

                                   For  example, if your simulation output lo-
                                   cation is s3://my-bucket  and  your  upload
                                   configuration  name  is  robot-test  , your

                                   s3://my-bucket/<simid>/<runid>/robot-test .

                               path -> (string)
                                   Specifies  the  path  of the file(s) to up-
                                   load. Standard Unix glob matching rules are
                                   accepted,  with the addition of ** as a su-
                                   per  asterisk  .  For  example,  specifying
                                   /var/log/**.log  causes  all  .log files in
                                   the /var/log  directory  tree  to  be  col-
                                   lected. For more examples, see Glob Library
                                   .

                                   Specifies when to upload the files:
                                      UPLOAD_ON_TERMINATE

                                   Matching files are uploaded once the  simu-
                                   lation enters the TERMINATING state. Match-
                                   ing files are not  uploaded  until  all  of
                                   your code (including tools) have stopped.

                                   If there is a problem uploading a file, the
                                   upload is retried. If problems persist,  no
                                   further upload attempts will be made.
                                      UPLOAD_ROLLING_AUTO_REMOVE

                                   Matching  files  are  uploaded  as they are
                                   created. They are deleted  after  they  are
                                   uploaded. The specified path is checked ev-
                                   ery 5 seconds. A final check is  made  when
                                   all  of  your  code  (including tools) have
                                   stopped.

                        useDefaultUploadConfigurations -> (boolean)
                            A Boolean indicating whether to use default upload
                            configurations. By default, .ros and .gazebo files
                            are uploaded when the application  terminates  and
                            all ROS topics will be recorded.

                                   the final path.

                                   For example, if your simulation output  lo-
                                   cation  is  s3://my-bucket  and your upload
                                   configuration name  is  robot-test  ,  your

                                   accepted, with the addition of ** as a  su-
                                   per  asterisk  .  For  example,  specifying
                                   /var/log/**.log causes all  .log  files  in
                                   the  /var/log  directory  tree  to  be col-
                                   lected. For more examples, see Glob Library
                                   .

                                      UPLOAD_ON_TERMINATE

                                   Matching  files are uploaded once the simu-
                                   lation enters the TERMINATING state. Match-
                                   ing  files  are  not  uploaded until all of
                                   your code (including tools) have stopped.

                                   If there is a problem uploading a file, the
                                   upload  is retried. If problems persist, no
                                   further upload attempts will be made.
                                      UPLOAD_ROLLING_AUTO_REMOVE

                                   Matching files are  uploaded  as  they  are
                                   created.  They  are  deleted after they are
                                   uploaded. The specified path is checked ev-
                                   ery  5  seconds. A final check is made when
                                   all of your  code  (including  tools)  have
                                   stopped.

                               loaded in Amazon S3. It is appended to the sim-
                               ulation  output location to determine the final
                               path.

                               For example, if your simulation output location
                               is s3://my-bucket and your upload configuration

                               all .log files in the /var/log  directory  tree
                               to  be  collected.  For more examples, see Glob
                               Library .

                               Matching files are uploaded once the simulation
                               enters  the  TERMINATING  state. Matching files
                               are not uploaded until all of  your  code  (in-
                               cluding tools) have stopped.

                               If there is a problem uploading a file, the up-
                               load is retried. If problems persist,  no  fur-
                               ther upload attempts will be made.
                                   UPLOAD_ROLLING_AUTO_REMOVE

                               Matching  files  are  uploaded as they are cre-
                               ated. They are deleted after they are uploaded.
                               The  specified path is checked every 5 seconds.
                               A final check is made when  all  of  your  code
                               (including tools) have stopped.

                     useDefaultUploadConfigurations -> (boolean)
                        A  Boolean  indicating  whether  to use default upload
                        configurations. By default, .ros and .gazebo files are
                        uploaded  when  the application terminates and all ROS
                        topics will be recorded.

                        If you set this value, you must specify an outputLoca-
                        tion .

                               loaded in Amazon S3. It is appended to the sim-
                               ulation  output location to determine the final
                               path.

                               For example, if your simulation output location
                               is s3://my-bucket and your upload configuration
                               name is robot-test , your  files  will  be  up-
                               loaded   to  s3://my-bucket/<simid>/<runid>/ro-
                               bot-test .

                            path -> (string)

                               with the addition of ** as a super  asterisk  .
                               For  example, specifying /var/log/**.log causes
                               all .log files in the /var/log  directory  tree
                               to  be  collected.  For more examples, see Glob
                               Library .

                            uploadBehavior -> (string)
                               Specifies when to upload the files:
                                   UPLOAD_ON_TERMINATE

                               Matching files are uploaded once the simulation
                               enters  the  TERMINATING  state. Matching files
                               are not uploaded until all of  your  code  (in-
                               cluding tools) have stopped.

                               If there is a problem uploading a file, the up-
                               load is retried. If problems persist,  no  fur-
                               ther upload attempts will be made.
                                   UPLOAD_ROLLING_AUTO_REMOVE

                               Matching  files  are  uploaded as they are cre-
                               ated. They are deleted after they are uploaded.
                               The  specified path is checked every 5 seconds.
                               A final check is made when  all  of  your  code
                               (including tools) have stopped.

                        A  Boolean  indicating  whether  to use default upload
                        configurations. By default, .ros and .gazebo files are
                        uploaded  when  the application terminates and all ROS
                        topics will be recorded.

                        If you set this value, you must specify an outputLoca-
