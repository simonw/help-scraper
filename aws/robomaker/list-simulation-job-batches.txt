LIST-SIMULATION-JOB-BATCHES()                    LIST-SIMULATION-JOB-BATCHES()



NAME
       list-simulation-job-batches -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list simulation job batches. You can optionally provide fil-
       ters to retrieve specific simulation batch jobs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-simulation-job-batches is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: simulationJobBatchSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-simulation-job-batches
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Optional filters to limit results.

          (structure)
              Information about a filter.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              values -> (list)
                 A list of values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       simulationJobBatchSummaries -> (list)
          A list of simulation job batch summaries.

          (structure)
              Information about a simulation job batch.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the batch.

              lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  time,  in milliseconds since the epoch, when the simula-
                 tion job batch was last updated.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when  the  simula-
                 tion job batch was created.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the simulation job batch.
                     Pending

                 The simulation job batch request is pending.
                     InProgress

                 The simulation job batch is in progress.
                     Failed

                 The  simulation  job batch failed. One or more simulation job
                 requests could not be completed due to  an  internal  failure
                 (like InternalServiceError ). See failureCode and failureRea-
                 son for more information.
                     Completed

                 The simulation batch job completed. A batch is complete  when
                 (1) there are no pending simulation job requests in the batch
                 and none of the failed simulation job requests are due to In-
                 ternalServiceError  and  (2) when all created simulation jobs
                 have reached a terminal  state  (for  example,  Completed  or
                 Failed ).
                     Canceled

                 The simulation batch job was cancelled.
                     Canceling

                 The simulation batch job is being cancelled.
                     Completing

                 The simulation batch job is completing.
                     TimingOut

                 The simulation job batch is timing out.

                 If  a  batch  timing out, and there are pending requests that
                 were failing due to an internal  failure  (like  InternalSer-
                 viceError  ),  the batch status will be Failed . If there are
                 no such failing request, the batch status will be TimedOut .
                     TimedOut

                 The simulation batch job timed out.

              failedRequestCount -> (integer)
                 The number of failed simulation job requests.

              pendingRequestCount -> (integer)
                 The number of pending simulation job requests.

              createdRequestCount -> (integer)
                 The number of created simulation job requests.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If the previous paginated request did not return all of the  remain-
          ing  results, the response object's nextToken parameter value is set
          to a token. To retrieve the next set of  results,  call  ListSimula-
          tionJobBatches  again  and assign that token to the request object's
          nextToken parameter. If there are no remaining results, the previous
          response object's NextToken parameter is set to null.
