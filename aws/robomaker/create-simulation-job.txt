                 The upload configurations for the robot application.

                 (structure)
                     Provides  upload configuration information. Files are up-
                     loaded from the simulation job to a location you specify.

                        A prefix that specifies where files will  be  uploaded
                        in  Amazon S3. It is appended to the simulation output
                        location to determine the final path.

                        For example, if your  simulation  output  location  is
                        s3://my-bucket  and  your upload configuration name is
                        robot-test  ,  your  files   will   be   uploaded   to
                        s3://my-bucket/<simid>/<runid>/robot-test .

                     path -> (string)
                        Specifies  the path of the file(s) to upload. Standard
                        Unix glob matching rules are accepted, with the  addi-
                        tion of ** as a super asterisk . For example, specify-
                        ing /var/log/**.log  causes  all  .log  files  in  the
                        /var/log  directory tree to be collected. For more ex-
                        amples, see Glob Library .

                     uploadBehavior -> (string)
                        Specifies when to upload the files:
                            UPLOAD_ON_TERMINATE

                        Matching files are uploaded once the simulation enters
                        the TERMINATING state. Matching files are not uploaded
                        until all of your code (including tools) have stopped.

                        If there is a problem uploading a file, the upload  is
                        retried.  If  problems  persist, no further upload at-
                        tempts will be made.
                            UPLOAD_ROLLING_AUTO_REMOVE

                        Matching files are uploaded as they are created.  They
                        are  deleted  after  they  are uploaded. The specified
                        path is checked every 5 seconds. A final check is made
                        when all of your code (including tools) have stopped.

              useDefaultUploadConfigurations -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean indicating whether to use default upload configura-
                 tions. By default, .ros and .gazebo files are  uploaded  when
                 the  application  terminates  and  all  ROS  topics  will  be
                 recorded.

                 If you set this value, you must specify an outputLocation .

              tools -> (list)
                 Information about tools configured for the robot application.

                 (structure)
                     Information about a tool. Tools are used in a  simulation
                     job.

                     streamUI -> (boolean)
                        Boolean indicating whether a streaming session will be
                        configured for the tool. If True , AWS RoboMaker  will
                        configure  a  connection  so you can interact with the
                        tool as it is running in the simulation. It must  have
                        a graphical user interface. The default is False .

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the tool.

                     command -> (string)
                        Command-line  arguments  for the tool. It must include
                        the tool executable name.

                     streamOutputToCloudWatch -> (boolean)
                        Boolean indicating whether logs will  be  recorded  in

                     exitBehavior -> (string)
                        Exit  behavior  determines what happens when your tool
                        quits running. RESTART will  cause  your  tool  to  be
                        restarted.  FAIL  will cause your job to exit. The de-
                        fault is RESTART .

              useDefaultTools -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean indicating whether to use default robot application
                 tools.  The  default tools are rviz, rqt, terminal and rosbag
                 record. The default is False .

                        the TERMINATING state. Matching files are not uploaded
                        until all of your code (including tools) have stopped.

                        If  there is a problem uploading a file, the upload is
                        retried. If problems persist, no  further  upload  at-
                        tempts will be made.

                        Matching  files are uploaded as they are created. They
                        are deleted after they  are  uploaded.  The  specified
                        path is checked every 5 seconds. A final check is made
                        when all of your code (including tools) have stopped.

                 A Boolean indicating whether to use default upload configura-
                 tions.  By  default, .ros and .gazebo files are uploaded when
                 the  application  terminates  and  all  ROS  topics  will  be
                 recorded.

                 If you set this value, you must specify an outputLocation .

                        configure  a  connection  so you can interact with the
                        tool as it is running in the simulation. It must  have

                        Exit  behavior  determines what happens when your tool
                        quits running. RESTART will  cause  your  tool  to  be
                        restarted.  FAIL  will cause your job to exit. The de-
                        fault is RESTART .

              useDefaultTools -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean indicating whether to use default simulation appli-
                 cation  tools.  The default tools are rviz, rqt, terminal and

       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

          vpcId -> (string)
              The VPC ID associated with your simulation job.

          assignPublicIp -> (boolean)
              A boolean indicating if a public IP was assigned.

       compute -> (structure)
          Compute information for the simulation job.

          simulationUnitLimit -> (integer)
              The simulation unit limit. Your simulation is allocated CPU  and
              memory  proportional  to  the  supplied simulation unit limit. A
              simulation unit is 1 vcpu and 2GB of memory. You are only billed
              for  the SU utilization you consume up to the maximum value pro-
              vided. The default is 15.

          computeType -> (string)
              Compute type response information for the simulation job.

          gpuUnitLimit -> (integer)
              Compute GPU unit limit for the simulation job. It is the same as
              the number of GPUs allocated to the SimulationJob.
