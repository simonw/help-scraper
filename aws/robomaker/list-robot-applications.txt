LIST-ROBOT-APPLICATIONS()                            LIST-ROBOT-APPLICATIONS()



NAME
       list-robot-applications -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of robot application. You can optionally provide filters
       to retrieve specific robot applications.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-robot-applications is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: robotApplicationSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-robot-applications
          [--version-qualifier <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --version-qualifier (string)
          The version qualifier of the robot application.

       --filters (list)
          Optional filters to limit results.

          The  filter name name is supported. When filtering, you must use the
          complete value of the filtered item. You can use up  to  three  fil-
          ters.

          (structure)
              Information about a filter.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              values -> (list)
                 A list of values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       This  example lists robot applications. Results are limited to 20 robot
       applications.

OUTPUT
       robotApplicationSummaries -> (list)
          A list of robot application summaries that meet the criteria of  the
          request.

          (structure)
              Summary information for a robot application.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the robot application.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the robot.

              version -> (string)
                 The version of the robot application.

              lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the robot ap-
                 plication was last updated.

              robotSoftwareSuite -> (structure)
                 Information about a robot software suite (ROS distribution).

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the robot software suite (ROS distribution).

                 version -> (string)
                     The version of the robot software  suite  (ROS  distribu-
                     tion).

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  the previous paginated request did not return all of the remain-
          ing results, the response object's nextToken parameter value is  set
          to  a  token. To retrieve the next set of results, call ListRobotAp-
          plications again and assign that token to the request object's next-
          Token parameter. If there are no remaining results, the previous re-
          sponse object's NextToken parameter is set to null.
