NAME
       list-world-generation-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists world generator jobs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-world-generation-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: worldGenerationJobSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-world-generation-jobs
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Optional filters to limit results. You can use status and templateId
          .

          (structure)
              Information about a filter.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              values -> (list)
                 A list of values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 generator job was created.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the world generator job:
                     Pending

                 The world generator job request is pending.

                     Failed

                 The  world generator job failed. See failureCode for more in-
                 formation.
                     PartialFailed

                 Some worlds did not generate.
                     Canceled

                 The world generator job was cancelled.
                     Canceling

              worldCount -> (structure)
                 Information about the world count.

                 floorplanCount -> (integer)
                     The number of unique floorplans.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If the previous paginated request did not return all of the  remain-
          ing  results, the response object's nextToken parameter value is set
          to a token. To retrieve the next set of results, call  ListWorldGen-
          eratorJobsRequest  again  and  assign  that token to the request ob-
          ject's nextToken parameter. If there are no remaining  results,  the
          previous response object's NextToken parameter is set to null.
