OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token from the previous SearchProfiles API call.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of objects returned per page.

       --domain-name (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       --key-name (string)
          A searchable identifier of a customer profile. The  predefined  keys
          you  can use to search include: _account, _profileId, _assetId, _ca-
          seId, _orderId, _fullName, _phone,  _email,  _ctrContactId,  _marke-
          toLeadId, _salesforceAccountId, _salesforceContactId, _salesforceAs-
          setId, _zendeskUserId, _zendeskExternalId, _zendeskTicketId, _servi-
          ceNowSystemId,  _serviceNowIncidentId,  _segmentUserId, _shopifyCus-
          tomerId, _shopifyOrderId.

       --values (list)
          A list of key values.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
