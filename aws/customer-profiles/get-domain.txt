GET-DOMAIN()                                                      GET-DOMAIN()



NAME
       get-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about a specific domain.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-domain
          --domain-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DomainName -> (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       DefaultExpirationDays -> (integer)
          The default number of days until the data within the domain expires.

       DefaultEncryptionKey -> (string)
          The default encryption key, which is an AWS  managed  key,  is  used
          when  no specific type of encryption key is specified. It is used to
          encrypt all data before it is placed in permanent or  semi-permanent
          storage.

       DeadLetterQueueUrl -> (string)
          The  URL  of  the SQS dead letter queue, which is used for reporting
          errors associated with ingesting data from third party applications.

       Stats -> (structure)
          Usage-specific statistics about the domain.

          ProfileCount -> (long)
              The total number of profiles currently in the domain.

          MeteringProfileCount -> (long)
              The number of profiles that you are currently paying for in  the
              domain. If you have more than 100 objects associated with a sin-
              gle profile, that profile counts as two profiles.  If  you  have
              more than 200 objects, that profile counts as three, and so on.

          ObjectCount -> (long)
              The total number of objects in domain.

          TotalSize -> (long)
              The total size, in bytes, of all objects in the domain.

       Matching -> (structure)
          The  process  of  matching  duplicate profiles. If Matching = true ,
          Amazon Connect Customer  Profiles  starts  a  weekly  batch  process
          called  Identity  Resolution  Job.  If you do not specify a date and
          time for Identity Resolution Job to run, by default  it  runs  every
          Saturday at 12AM UTC to detect duplicate profiles in your domains.

          After  the Identity Resolution Job completes, use the GetMatches API
          to return and review the results. Or, if you have configured Export-
          ingConfig in the MatchingRequest , you can download the results from
          S3.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              The flag that enables the matching  process  of  duplicate  pro-
              files.

          JobSchedule -> (structure)
              The  day and time when do you want to start the Identity Resolu-
              tion Job every week.

              DayOfTheWeek -> (string)
                 The day when the Identity Resolution  Job  should  run  every
                 week.

              Time -> (string)
                 The  time  when  the Identity Resolution Job should run every
                 week.

          AutoMerging -> (structure)
              Configuration information about the auto-merging process.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 The flag that enables the auto-merging of duplicate profiles.

              Consolidation -> (structure)
                 A list of matching attributes that represent matching  crite-
                 ria. If two profiles meet at least one of the requirements in
                 the matching attributes list, they will be merged.

                 MatchingAttributesList -> (list)
                     A list of matching criteria.

                     (list)
                        (string)

              ConflictResolution -> (structure)
                 How the auto-merging process should resolve conflicts between
                 different  profiles.  For example, if Profile A and Profile B
                 have the same FirstName and LastName (and that is the  match-
                 ing criteria), which EmailAddress should be used?

                 ConflictResolvingModel -> (string)
                     How the auto-merging process should resolve conflicts be-
                     tween different profiles.

                     o RECENCY : Uses the data that was most recently updated.

                     o SOURCE : Uses the data from a specific source. For  ex-
                       ample, if a company has been aquired or two departments
                       have merged, data from the specified source is used. If
                       two  duplicate  profiles are from the same source, then
                       RECENCY is used again.

                 SourceName -> (string)
                     The ObjectType name that is used to resolve profile merg-
                     ing conflicts when choosing SOURCE as the ConflictResolv-
                     ingModel .

          ExportingConfig -> (structure)
              Configuration information for exporting Identity Resolution  re-
              sults, for example, to an S3 bucket.

              S3Exporting -> (structure)
                 The  S3  location where Identity Resolution Jobs write result
                 files.

                 S3BucketName -> (string)
                     The name of the S3 bucket where Identity Resolution  Jobs
                     write result files.

                 S3KeyName -> (string)
                     The S3 key name of the location where Identity Resolution
                     Jobs write result files.

       CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of when the domain was created.

       LastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of when the domain was most recently edited.

       Tags -> (map)
          The tags used to organize, track, or control  access  for  this  re-
          source.
