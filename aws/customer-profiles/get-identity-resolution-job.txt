GET-IDENTITY-RESOLUTION-JOB()                    GET-IDENTITY-RESOLUTION-JOB()



NAME
       get-identity-resolution-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about an Identity Resolution Job in a specific do-
       main.

       Identity Resolution Jobs are set up using the Amazon Connect admin con-
       sole.  For more information, see Use Identity Resolution to consolidate
       similar profiles .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-identity-resolution-job
          --domain-name <value>
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       --job-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the Identity Resolution Job.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DomainName -> (string)
          The unique name of the domain.

       JobId -> (string)
          The unique identifier of the Identity Resolution Job.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the Identity Resolution Job.

          o PENDING : The Identity Resolution Job is  scheduled  but  has  not
            started  yet.  If  you turn off the Identity Resolution feature in
            your domain, jobs in the PENDING state are deleted.

          o PREPROCESSING : The Identity Resolution Job is loading your data.

          o FIND_MATCHING : The Identity Resolution Job is using  the  machine
            learning model to identify profiles that belong to the same match-
            ing group.

          o MERGING : The Identity Resolution Job is  merging  duplicate  pro-
            files.

          o COMPLETED : The Identity Resolution Job completed successfully.

          o PARTIAL_SUCCESS  :  There's a system error and not all of the data
            is merged. The Identity Resolution Job writes a message indicating
            the source of the problem.

          o FAILED  :  The  Identity Resolution Job did not merge any data. It
            writes a message indicating the source of the problem.

       Message -> (string)
          The error messages that are generated when the  Identity  Resolution
          Job runs.

       JobStartTime -> (timestamp)
          The  timestamp  of  when  the Identity Resolution Job was started or
          will be started.

       JobEndTime -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of when the Identity Resolution Job was completed.

       LastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of when the Identity Resolution Job was most  recently
          edited.

       JobExpirationTime -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of when the Identity Resolution Job will expire.

       AutoMerging -> (structure)
          Configuration  settings  for how to perform the auto-merging of pro-
          files.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              The flag that enables the auto-merging of duplicate profiles.

          Consolidation -> (structure)
              A list of matching attributes that represent matching  criteria.
              If  two  profiles  meet  at least one of the requirements in the
              matching attributes list, they will be merged.

              MatchingAttributesList -> (list)
                 A list of matching criteria.

                 (list)
                     (string)

          ConflictResolution -> (structure)
              How the auto-merging process should  resolve  conflicts  between
              different profiles. For example, if Profile A and Profile B have
              the same FirstName and LastName (and that is the matching crite-
              ria), which EmailAddress should be used?

              ConflictResolvingModel -> (string)
                 How the auto-merging process should resolve conflicts between
                 different profiles.

                 o RECENCY : Uses the data that was most recently updated.

                 o SOURCE : Uses the data from a specific source. For example,
                   if  a  company  has  been  aquired  or two departments have
                   merged, data from the specified source is used. If two  du-
                   plicate  profiles are from the same source, then RECENCY is
                   used again.

              SourceName -> (string)
                 The ObjectType name that is used to resolve  profile  merging
                 conflicts  when choosing SOURCE as the ConflictResolvingModel
                 .

       ExportingLocation -> (structure)
          The S3 location where the  Identity  Resolution  Job  writes  result
          files.

          S3Exporting -> (structure)
              Information about the S3 location where Identity Resolution Jobs
              write result files.

              S3BucketName -> (string)
                 The name of the S3 bucket name where Identity Resolution Jobs
                 write result files.

              S3KeyName -> (string)
                 The  S3  key  name  of the location where Identity Resolution
                 Jobs write result files.

       JobStats -> (structure)
          Statistics about the Identity Resolution Job.

          NumberOfProfilesReviewed -> (long)
              The number of profiles reviewed.

          NumberOfMatchesFound -> (long)
              The number of matches found.
