CREATE-ML-TRANSFORM()                                    CREATE-ML-TRANSFORM()



NAME
       create-ml-transform -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an Glue machine learning transform. This operation creates the
       transform and all the necessary parameters to train it.

       Call this operation as the first step in the process of using a machine
       learning  transform (such as the FindMatches transform) for deduplicat-
       ing data. You can provide an optional Description , in addition to  the
       parameters that you want to use for your algorithm.

       You  must  also specify certain parameters for the tasks that Glue runs
       on your behalf as part of  learning  from  your  data  and  creating  a
       high-quality  machine learning transform. These parameters include Role
       , and optionally, AllocatedCapacity , Timeout , and  MaxRetries  .  For
       more information, see Jobs .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The unique name that you give the transform when you create it.

       --description (string)
          A  description  of  the machine learning transform that is being de-
          fined. The default is an empty string.

       --input-record-tables (list)
          A list of Glue table definitions used by the transform.

          (structure)
              The database and table in the Glue Data Catalog that is used for
              input or output data.

              DatabaseName -> (string)
                 A database name in the Glue Data Catalog.

              TableName -> (string)
                 A table name in the Glue Data Catalog.

              CatalogId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the Glue Data Catalog.

              ConnectionName -> (string)
                 The name of the connection to the Glue Data Catalog.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DatabaseName=string,TableName=string,CatalogId=string,ConnectionName=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "DatabaseName": "string",
              "TableName": "string",
              "CatalogId": "string",
              "ConnectionName": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --parameters (structure)
          The  algorithmic  parameters that are specific to the transform type
          used. Conditionally dependent on the transform type.

          TransformType -> (string)
              The type of machine learning transform.

              For information about the types of machine learning  transforms,
              see Creating Machine Learning Transforms .

          FindMatchesParameters -> (structure)
              The parameters for the find matches algorithm.

              PrimaryKeyColumnName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  a  column that uniquely identifies rows in the
                 source table. Used to help identify matching records.

              PrecisionRecallTradeoff -> (double)
                 The value selected when tuning your transform for  a  balance
                 between precision and recall. A value of 0.5 means no prefer-
                 ence; a value of 1.0 means a bias purely for precision, and a
                 value  of  0.0  means  a  bias  for recall. Because this is a
                 tradeoff, choosing values close to 1.0 means very low recall,
                 and  choosing  values close to 0.0 results in very low preci-
                 sion.

                 The precision metric indicates how often your model  is  cor-
                 rect when it predicts a match.

                 The recall metric indicates that for an actual match, how of-
                 ten your model predicts the match.

              AccuracyCostTradeoff -> (double)
                 The value that is selected when tuning your transform  for  a
                 balance  between accuracy and cost. A value of 0.5 means that
                 the system balances accuracy and cost concerns.  A  value  of
                 1.0 means a bias purely for accuracy, which typically results
                 in a higher cost, sometimes substantially higher. A value  of
                 0.0 means a bias purely for cost, which results in a less ac-
                 curate FindMatches transform, sometimes with unacceptable ac-
                 curacy.

                 Accuracy measures how well the transform finds true positives
                 and true negatives. Increasing accuracy requires more machine
                 resources and cost. But it also results in increased recall.

                 Cost measures how many compute resources, and thus money, are
                 consumed to run the transform.

              EnforceProvidedLabels -> (boolean)
                 The value to switch on or off to force the  output  to  match
                 the  provided  labels  from users. If the value is True , the
                 find matches transform forces the output to  match  the  pro-
                 vided  labels. The results override the normal conflation re-
                 sults. If the value is False ,  the  find  matches  transform
                 does  not  ensure  all the labels provided are respected, and
                 the results rely on the trained model.

                 Note that setting this value to true may increase the confla-
                 tion execution time.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TransformType=string,FindMatchesParameters={PrimaryKeyColumnName=string,PrecisionRecallTradeoff=double,AccuracyCostTradeoff=double,EnforceProvidedLabels=boolean}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TransformType": "FIND_MATCHES",
            "FindMatchesParameters": {
              "PrimaryKeyColumnName": "string",
              "PrecisionRecallTradeoff": double,
              "AccuracyCostTradeoff": double,
              "EnforceProvidedLabels": true|false
            }
          }

       --role (string)
          The  name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role with the re-
          quired permissions. The required permissions include both Glue  ser-
          vice  role  permissions to Glue resources, and Amazon S3 permissions
          required by the transform.

          o This role needs Glue service role permissions to allow  access  to
            resources  in  Glue.  See Attach a Policy to IAM Users That Access
            Glue .

          o This role needs permission to your Amazon Simple  Storage  Service
            (Amazon  S3)  sources,  targets, temporary directory, scripts, and
            any libraries used by the task run for this transform.

       --glue-version (string)
          This value determines which version of Glue  this  machine  learning
          transform  is compatible with. Glue 1.0 is recommended for most cus-
          tomers. If the value is not set, the Glue compatibility defaults  to
          Glue  0.9.  For more information, see Glue Versions in the developer
          guide.

       --max-capacity (double)
          The number of Glue data processing units (DPUs) that  are  allocated
          to  task  runs  for  this  transform. You can allocate from 2 to 100
          DPUs; the default is 10. A DPU is a relative measure  of  processing
          power that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB of mem-
          ory. For more information, see the Glue pricing page .
              MaxCapacity is a mutually exclusive option with  NumberOfWorkers
              and WorkerType .

          o If  either  NumberOfWorkers or WorkerType is set, then MaxCapacity
            cannot be set.

          o If MaxCapacity is set then neither NumberOfWorkers  or  WorkerType
            can be set.

          o If  WorkerType  is set, then NumberOfWorkers is required (and vice
            versa).

          o MaxCapacity and NumberOfWorkers must both be at least 1.

          When the WorkerType field is set to a value other  than  Standard  ,
          the MaxCapacity field is set automatically and becomes read-only.

          When  the  WorkerType  field is set to a value other than Standard ,
          the MaxCapacity field is set automatically and becomes read-only.

       --worker-type (string)
          The type of predefined worker that is allocated when this task runs.
          Accepts a value of Standard, G.1X, or G.2X.

          o For  the  Standard worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB
            of memory and a 50GB disk, and 2 executors per worker.

          o For the G.1X worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU,  16  GB  of
            memory and a 64GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.

          o For  the  G.2X  worker type, each worker provides 8 vCPU, 32 GB of
            memory and a 128GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.
              MaxCapacity is a mutually exclusive option with  NumberOfWorkers
              and WorkerType .

          o If  either  NumberOfWorkers or WorkerType is set, then MaxCapacity
            cannot be set.

          o If MaxCapacity is set then neither NumberOfWorkers  or  WorkerType
            can be set.

          o If  WorkerType  is set, then NumberOfWorkers is required (and vice
            versa).

          o MaxCapacity and NumberOfWorkers must both be at least 1.

          Possible values:

          o Standard

          o G.1X

          o G.2X

       --number-of-workers (integer)
          The number of workers of a defined  workerType  that  are  allocated
          when this task runs.

          If  WorkerType  is  set,  then NumberOfWorkers is required (and vice
          versa).

       --timeout (integer)
          The timeout of the task run for this transform in minutes.  This  is
          the  maximum time that a task run for this transform can consume re-
          sources before it is terminated and enters TIMEOUT status.  The  de-
          fault is 2,880 minutes (48 hours).

       --max-retries (integer)
          The maximum number of times to retry a task for this transform after
          a task run fails.

       --tags (map)
          The tags to use with this machine learning transform.  You  may  use
          tags to limit access to the machine learning transform. For more in-
          formation about tags in Glue, see Amazon Web Services Tags  in  Glue
          in the developer guide.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --transform-encryption (structure)
          The  encryption-at-rest  settings of the transform that apply to ac-
          cessing user data. Machine learning transforms can access user  data
          encrypted in Amazon S3 using KMS.

          MlUserDataEncryption -> (structure)
              An  MLUserDataEncryption  object  containing the encryption mode
              and customer-provided KMS key ID.

              MlUserDataEncryptionMode -> (string)
                 The encryption mode applied to user data. Valid values are:

                 o DISABLED: encryption is disabled

                 o SSEKMS: use of server-side encryption with  Key  Management
                   Service (SSE-KMS) for user data stored in Amazon S3.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The ID for the customer-provided KMS key.

          TaskRunSecurityConfigurationName -> (string)
              The name of the security configuration.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MlUserDataEncryption={MlUserDataEncryptionMode=string,KmsKeyId=string},TaskRunSecurityConfigurationName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MlUserDataEncryption": {
              "MlUserDataEncryptionMode": "DISABLED"|"SSE-KMS",
              "KmsKeyId": "string"
            },
            "TaskRunSecurityConfigurationName": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TransformId -> (string)
          A unique identifier that is generated for the transform.
