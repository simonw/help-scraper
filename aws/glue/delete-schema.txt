DELETE-SCHEMA()                                                DELETE-SCHEMA()



NAME
       delete-schema -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the entire schema set, including the schema set and all of its
       versions. To get the status of  the  delete  operation,  you  can  call
       GetSchema API after the asynchronous call. Deleting a registry will de-
       activate all online operations for the schema, such as the GetSchemaBy-
       Definition , and RegisterSchemaVersion APIs.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-schema
          --schema-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --schema-id (structure)
          This  is  a  wrapper  structure that may contain the schema name and
          Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

          SchemaArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the schema. One  of  SchemaArn
              or SchemaName has to be provided.

          SchemaName -> (string)
              The name of the schema. One of SchemaArn or SchemaName has to be
              provided.

          RegistryName -> (string)
              The name of the schema registry that contains the schema.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SchemaArn=string,SchemaName=string,RegistryName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SchemaArn": "string",
            "SchemaName": "string",
            "RegistryName": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SchemaArn -> (string)

       SchemaName -> (string)
          The name of the schema being deleted.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the schema.
