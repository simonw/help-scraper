       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-job
          --job-name <value>
          --job-update <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-name (string)
          The name of the job definition to update.

       --job-update (structure)
          Specifies the values with which to update the job definition.

          Description -> (string)
              Description of the job being defined.

          LogUri -> (string)
              This field is reserved for future use.

          Role -> (string)
              The  name  or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role associ-
              ated with this job (required).

          ExecutionProperty -> (structure)
              An ExecutionProperty specifying the maximum number of concurrent
              runs allowed for this job.

              MaxConcurrentRuns -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  number  of concurrent runs allowed for the job.
                 The default is 1. An error is returned when this threshold is
                 reached. The maximum value you can specify is controlled by a
                 service limit.

          Command -> (structure)
              The JobCommand that runs this job (required).

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the job command. For an  Apache  Spark  ETL  job,
                 this  must  be  glueetl  . For a Python shell job, it must be
                 pythonshell . For an Apache Spark  streaming  ETL  job,  this
                 must be gluestreaming .

              ScriptLocation -> (string)
                 Specifies  the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) path
                 to a script that runs a job.

              PythonVersion -> (string)
                 The Python version being used to run a Python shell job.  Al-
                 lowed values are 2 or 3.

          DefaultArguments -> (map)
              The default arguments for this job.

              You  can  specify  arguments  here  that  your own job-execution
              script consumes, as well as arguments that Glue itself consumes.

              For information about how to specify and consume  your  own  Job
              arguments,  see the Calling Glue APIs in Python topic in the de-
              veloper guide.

              For information about the key-value pairs that Glue consumes  to
              set  up  your job, see the Special Parameters Used by Glue topic
              in the developer guide.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          NonOverridableArguments -> (map)
              Non-overridable arguments for this job, specified as  name-value
              pairs.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          Connections -> (structure)
              The connections used for this job.

              Connections -> (list)
                 A list of connections used by the job.

                 (string)

          MaxRetries -> (integer)
              The maximum number of times to retry this job if it fails.

          AllocatedCapacity -> (integer)
              This field is deprecated. Use MaxCapacity instead.

              The  number  of Glue data processing units (DPUs) to allocate to
              this job. You can allocate from 2 to 100 DPUs;  the  default  is
              10.  A  DPU  is a relative measure of processing power that con-
              sists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB  of  memory.  For
              more information, see the Glue pricing page .

          Timeout -> (integer)
              The  job timeout in minutes. This is the maximum time that a job
              run can consume resources before it  is  terminated  and  enters
              TIMEOUT status. The default is 2,880 minutes (48 hours).

          MaxCapacity -> (double)
              For  Glue version 1.0 or earlier jobs, using the standard worker
              type, the number of Glue data processing units (DPUs)  that  can
              be  allocated when this job runs. A DPU is a relative measure of
              processing power that consists of 4 vCPUs  of  compute  capacity
              and  16 GB of memory. For more information, see the Glue pricing
              page .

              Do not set Max Capacity if using WorkerType and  NumberOfWorkers
              .

              The  value  that  can  be  allocated  for MaxCapacity depends on
              whether you are running a Python shell job or  an  Apache  Spark
              ETL job:

              o When you specify a Python shell job (JobCommand.Name ="python-
                shell"), you can allocate either 0.0625 or 1 DPU. The  default
                is 0.0625 DPU.

              o When  you  specify  an  Apache  Spark ETL job (JobCommand.Name
                ="glueetl") or Apache Spark streaming ETL job (JobCommand.Name
                ="gluestreaming"),  you  can  allocate from 2 to 100 DPUs. The
                default is 10 DPUs. This job type cannot have a fractional DPU
                allocation.

              For  Glue version 2.0 jobs, you cannot instead specify a Maximum
              capacity . Instead, you should specify a  Worker  type  and  the
              Number of workers .

          WorkerType -> (string)
              The type of predefined worker that is allocated when a job runs.
              Accepts a value of Standard, G.1X, or G.2X.

              o For the Standard worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU,  16
                GB of memory and a 50GB disk, and 2 executors per worker.

              o For  the  G.1X worker type, each worker maps to 1 DPU (4 vCPU,
                16 GB of memory, 64 GB disk),  and  provides  1  executor  per
                worker.  We  recommend  this  worker type for memory-intensive
                jobs.

              o For the G.2X worker type, each worker maps to 2 DPU  (8  vCPU,
                32  GB  of  memory,  128 GB disk), and provides 1 executor per
                worker. We recommend this  worker  type  for  memory-intensive
                jobs.

          NumberOfWorkers -> (integer)
              The number of workers of a defined workerType that are allocated
              when a job runs.

              The maximum number of workers you can define are 299 for G.1X  ,
              and 149 for G.2X .

          SecurityConfiguration -> (string)
              The  name of the SecurityConfiguration structure to be used with
              this job.

          NotificationProperty -> (structure)
              Specifies the configuration properties of a job notification.

              NotifyDelayAfter -> (integer)
                 After a job run starts, the number of minutes to wait  before
                 sending a job run delay notification.

          GlueVersion -> (string)
              Glue  version determines the versions of Apache Spark and Python
              that Glue supports. The Python  version  indicates  the  version
              supported for jobs of type Spark.

              For  more information about the available Glue versions and cor-
              responding Spark and Python versions, see Glue  version  in  the
              developer guide.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       JobName -> (string)
          Returns the name of the updated job definition.
