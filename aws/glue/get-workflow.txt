OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the workflow to retrieve.

       --include-graph | --no-include-graph (boolean)
          Specifies whether to include a graph when returning the workflow re-
          source metadata.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

                                   AllocatedCapacity -> (integer)
                                      This field is deprecated. Use  MaxCapac-
                                      ity instead.

                                      The number of Glue data processing units
                                      (DPUs) allocated to this JobRun. From  2
                                      to  100  DPUs  can be allocated; the de-
                                      fault is 10. A DPU is a relative measure
                                      of  processing  power that consists of 4
                                      vCPUs of compute capacity and 16  GB  of
                                      memory.  For  more  information, see the
                                      Glue pricing page .

                                   ExecutionTime -> (integer)
                                      The amount of time (in seconds) that the
                                      job run consumed resources.

                                   Timeout -> (integer)
                                      The  JobRun  timeout in minutes. This is
                                      the maximum time that a job run can con-
                                      sume  resources  before it is terminated
                                      and enters TIMEOUT  status.  This  value
                                      overrides  the  timeout value set in the
                                      parent job.

                                      Streaming jobs do not  have  a  timeout.
                                      The  default  for  non-streaming jobs is
                                      2,880 minutes (48 hours).

                                   MaxCapacity -> (double)
                                      The number of Glue data processing units
                                      (DPUs)  that  can be allocated when this
                                      job runs. A DPU is a relative measure of
                                      processing  power that consists of 4 vC-
                                      PUs of compute capacity  and  16  GB  of
                                      memory.  For  more  information, see the
                                      Glue pricing page .

                                      Do not set Max Capacity if using Worker-
                                      Type and NumberOfWorkers .

                                      The value that can be allocated for Max-
                                      Capacity depends on whether you are run-
                                      ning  a  Python  shell  job or an Apache
                                      Spark ETL job:

                                      o When you specify a  Python  shell  job
                                        (JobCommand.Name  ="pythonshell"), you
                                        can allocate either 0.0625 or  1  DPU.
                                        The default is 0.0625 DPU.

                                      o When  you  specify an Apache Spark ETL
                                        job (JobCommand.Name ="glueetl"),  you
                                        can  allocate a minimum of 2 DPUs. The
                                        default is 10 DPUs. This job type can-
                                        not have a fractional DPU allocation.

                                   WorkerType -> (string)
                                      The  type  of  predefined worker that is
                                      allocated when a  job  runs.  Accepts  a
                                      value   of   Standard,  G.1X,  G.2X,  or
                                      G.025X.

                                      o For the  Standard  worker  type,  each
                                        worker  provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of mem-
                                        ory and a 50GB disk, and  2  executors
                                        per worker.

                                      o For  the G.1X worker type, each worker
                                        provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory and a
                                        64GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.

                                      o For  the G.2X worker type, each worker
                                        provides 8 vCPU, 32 GB of memory and a
                                        128GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.

                                      o For   the  G.025X  worker  type,  each
                                        worker maps to 0.25 DPU (2 vCPU, 4  GB
                                        of memory, 64 GB disk), and provides 1
                                        executor per worker. We recommend this
                                        worker  type  for low volume streaming
                                        jobs. This worker type is only  avail-
                                        able  for  Glue  version 3.0 streaming
                                        jobs.

                                   NumberOfWorkers -> (integer)
                                      The number of workers of a defined work-
                                      erType  that  are  allocated  when a job
                                      runs.

                                   SecurityConfiguration -> (string)

                                      ports. The Python version indicates  the
                                      version   supported  for  jobs  of  type
                                      Spark.

                                      For more information about the available
                                      Glue  versions  and  corresponding Spark
                                      and Python versions, see Glue version in
                                      the developer guide.

                                      a Glue version default to Glue 0.9.

                                   DPUSeconds -> (double)
                                      This field populates only for Auto Scal-
                                      ing  job  runs, and represents the total
                                      time each executor ran during the  life-
                                      cycle  of  a  job run in seconds, multi-
                                      plied by a DPU factor (1 for  G.1X  ,  2
                                      for  G.2X , or 0.25 for G.025X workers).
                                      This value may be different than the ex-
                                      ecutionEngineRuntime * MaxCapacity as in
                                      the case of Auto Scaling  jobs,  as  the
                                      number  of  executors running at a given
                                      time may be less than the MaxCapacity  .
                                      Therefore, it is possible that the value
                                      of DPUSeconds  is  less  than  executio-
                                      nEngineRuntime * MaxCapacity .

                                   ExecutionClass -> (string)

                                      standard or  flexible  execution  class.
                                      The  standard  execution-class  is ideal
                                      for time-sensitive  workloads  that  re-
                                      quire fast job startup and dedicated re-
                                      sources.

                                      The flexible execution class  is  appro-
                                      priate  for  time-insensitive jobs whose
                                      start and completion times may vary.

                                      Only jobs  with  Glue  version  3.0  and
                                      above  and  command type glueetl will be
                                      allowed to set ExecutionClass to FLEX  .
                                      The  flexible  execution class is avail-
                                      able for Spark jobs.

                                   For  this job run, they replace the default
                                   arguments set in the job definition itself.

                                   You can specify arguments  here  that  your
                                   own  job-execution script consumes, as well
                                   as arguments that Glue itself consumes.

                                          by the predecessor job run.

                                      RunId -> (string)
                                          The job-run ID  of  the  predecessor
                                          job run.

                               AllocatedCapacity -> (integer)
                                   This  field  is deprecated. Use MaxCapacity
                                   instead.

                                   The number of Glue  data  processing  units
                                   (DPUs)  allocated to this JobRun. From 2 to
                                   100 DPUs can be allocated; the  default  is
                                   10. A DPU is a relative measure of process-
                                   ing power that consists of 4 vCPUs of  com-
                                   pute capacity and 16 GB of memory. For more

                               ExecutionTime -> (integer)
                                   The amount of time (in  seconds)  that  the
                                   job run consumed resources.

                               Timeout -> (integer)
                                   The  JobRun timeout in minutes. This is the
                                   maximum time that a job run can consume re-
                                   sources  before it is terminated and enters
                                   TIMEOUT status. This  value  overrides  the
                                   timeout value set in the parent job.

                                   Streaming  jobs  do not have a timeout. The
                                   default for  non-streaming  jobs  is  2,880
                                   minutes (48 hours).

                               MaxCapacity -> (double)
                                   The  number  of  Glue data processing units
                                   (DPUs) that can be allocated when this  job
                                   runs.  A  DPU is a relative measure of pro-
                                   cessing power that consists of 4  vCPUs  of
                                   compute  capacity  and 16 GB of memory. For
                                   more information, see the Glue pricing page
                                   .

                                   Do not set Max Capacity if using WorkerType
                                   and NumberOfWorkers .

                                   The value that can be allocated for  MaxCa-
                                   pacity depends on whether you are running a
                                   Python shell job or  an  Apache  Spark  ETL
                                   job:

                                   o When you specify a Python shell job (Job-
                                     Command.Name ="pythonshell"), you can al-
                                     locate  either  0.0625  or 1 DPU. The de-
                                     fault is 0.0625 DPU.

                                   o When you specify an Apache Spark ETL  job
                                     (JobCommand.Name ="glueetl"), you can al-
                                     locate a minimum of 2 DPUs.  The  default
                                     is  10  DPUs. This job type cannot have a
                                     fractional DPU allocation.

                               WorkerType -> (string)
                                   The type of predefined worker that is allo-
                                   cated  when  a job runs. Accepts a value of
                                   Standard, G.1X, G.2X, or G.025X.

                                   o For the Standard worker type, each worker
                                     provides  4  vCPU,  16 GB of memory and a
                                     50GB disk, and 2 executors per worker.

                                   o For the G.1X  worker  type,  each  worker
                                     provides  4  vCPU,  16 GB of memory and a
                                     64GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.

                                   o For the G.2X  worker  type,  each  worker
                                     provides  8  vCPU,  32 GB of memory and a
                                     128GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.

                                   o For the G.025X worker type,  each  worker
                                     maps to 0.25 DPU (2 vCPU, 4 GB of memory,
                                     64 GB disk), and provides 1 executor  per
                                     worker. We recommend this worker type for
                                     low volume streaming  jobs.  This  worker
                                     type  is  only available for Glue version
                                     3.0 streaming jobs.

                               NumberOfWorkers -> (integer)
                                   The number of workers of a defined  worker-
                                   Type that are allocated when a job runs.

                               SecurityConfiguration -> (string)
                                   The   name   of  the  SecurityConfiguration
                                   structure to be used with this job run.

                               LogGroupName -> (string)
                                   The name of the log group for  secure  log-
                                   ging  that  can be server-side encrypted in
                                   Amazon CloudWatch using KMS. This name  can
                                   be  /aws-glue/jobs/ , in which case the de-
                                   fault encryption is NONE .  If  you  add  a
                                   role  name  and  SecurityConfiguration name
                                   (in other  words,  /aws-glue/jobs-yourRole-
                                   Name-yourSecurityConfigurationName/ ), then
                                   that security configuration is used to  en-
                                   crypt the log group.

                               NotificationProperty -> (structure)

                                      delay notification.

                               GlueVersion -> (string)
                                   Glue version  determines  the  versions  of
                                   Apache Spark and Python that Glue supports.
                                   The Python version  indicates  the  version
                                   supported for jobs of type Spark.

                                   For  more  information  about the available
                                   Glue versions and corresponding  Spark  and
                                   Python  versions,  see  Glue version in the
                                   developer guide.

                                   Jobs that are created without specifying  a
                                   Glue version default to Glue 0.9.

                               DPUSeconds -> (double)
                                   This  field populates only for Auto Scaling
                                   job runs, and  represents  the  total  time
                                   each executor ran during the lifecycle of a
                                   job run in seconds,  multiplied  by  a  DPU
                                   factor  (1  for G.1X , 2 for G.2X , or 0.25
                                   for G.025X workers). This value may be dif-
                                   ferent  than  the  executionEngineRuntime *
                                   MaxCapacity as in the case of Auto  Scaling
                                   jobs, as the number of executors running at
                                   a given time may be less than the MaxCapac-
                                   ity  .  Therefore,  it is possible that the
                                   value of DPUSeconds is less than  executio-
                                   nEngineRuntime * MaxCapacity .

                               ExecutionClass -> (string)
                                   Indicates  whether  the  job  is run with a
                                   standard or flexible execution  class.  The
                                   standard   execution-class   is  ideal  for
                                   time-sensitive workloads that require  fast
                                   job startup and dedicated resources.

                                   The flexible execution class is appropriate
                                   for time-insensitive jobs whose  start  and
                                   completion times may vary.

                                   Only  jobs  with Glue version 3.0 and above
                                   and command type glueetl will be allowed to
                                   set  ExecutionClass  to FLEX . The flexible
                                   execution  class  is  available  for  Spark
                                   jobs.

                 longing to the workflow.

                 (structure)
                     An edge represents a directed connection between two Glue
                     components that are part of the workflow the edge belongs
                     to.

                     SourceId -> (string)
                        The unique of the node within the workflow  where  the

                        The  unique  of the node within the workflow where the
                        edge ends.

          MaxConcurrentRuns -> (integer)
              You can use this parameter to prevent unwanted multiple  updates
              to  data, to control costs, or in some cases, to prevent exceed-
              ing the maximum number of concurrent runs of any of  the  compo-
              nent  jobs. If you leave this parameter blank, there is no limit
