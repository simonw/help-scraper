GET-CONNECTION()                                              GET-CONNECTION()



NAME
       get-connection -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a connection definition from the Data Catalog.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-connection
          [--catalog-id <value>]
          --name <value>
          [--hide-password | --no-hide-password]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The  ID of the Data Catalog in which the connection resides. If none
          is provided, the Amazon Web Services account ID is used by default.

       --name (string)
          The name of the connection definition to retrieve.

       --hide-password | --no-hide-password (boolean)
          Allows you to retrieve the connection metadata without returning the
          password.  For instance, the Glue console uses this flag to retrieve
          the connection, and does not display the password. Set this  parame-
          ter  when the caller might not have permission to use the KMS key to
          decrypt the password, but it does have permission to access the rest
          of the connection properties.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              tion.

              (string)

          ConnectionProperties -> (map)
              These key-value pairs define parameters for the connection:

              o HOST  -  The  host URI: either the fully qualified domain name
                (FQDN) or the IPv4 address of the database host.

              o PORT - The port number, between 1024 and 65535, of the port on
                which the database host is listening for database connections.

              o USER_NAME  -  The  name under which to log in to the database.
                The value string for USER_NAME is "USERNAME ".

              o PASSWORD - A password, if one is used, for the user name.

              o ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD - When you enable connection password  pro-
                tection  by  setting  ConnectionPasswordEncryption in the Data
                Catalog encryption settings, this field stores  the  encrypted
                password.

              o JDBC_DRIVER_JAR_URI  - The Amazon Simple Storage Service (Ama-
                zon S3) path of the JAR file that contains the JDBC driver  to
                use.

              o JDBC_DRIVER_CLASS_NAME  - The class name of the JDBC driver to
                use.

              o JDBC_ENGINE - The name of the JDBC engine to use.

              o JDBC_ENGINE_VERSION - The version of the JDBC engine to use.

              o CONFIG_FILES - (Reserved for future use.)

              o INSTANCE_ID - The instance ID to use.

              o JDBC_CONNECTION_URL - The URL for connecting to  a  JDBC  data
                source.

              o JDBC_ENFORCE_SSL  -  A Boolean string (true, false) specifying
                whether Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) with hostname  matching  is
                enforced for the JDBC connection on the client. The default is
                false.

              o CUSTOM_JDBC_CERT - An Amazon S3 location specifying  the  cus-
                tomer's  root  certificate. Glue uses this root certificate to
                validate the customers certificate when connecting to the cus-
                tomer database. Glue only handles X.509 certificates. The cer-
                tificate provided must be DER-encoded and supplied  in  Base64
                encoding PEM format.

              o SKIP_CUSTOM_JDBC_CERT_VALIDATION - By default, this is false .
                Glue validates the Signature algorithm and Subject Public  Key
                Algorithm for the customer certificate. The only permitted al-
                gorithms  for  the  Signature  algorithm  are   SHA256withRSA,
                SHA384withRSA or SHA512withRSA. For the Subject Public Key Al-
                gorithm, the key length must be at least 2048. You can set the
                value of this property to true to skip Glues validation of the
                customer certificate.

              o CUSTOM_JDBC_CERT_STRING - A  custom  JDBC  certificate  string
                which  is used for domain match or distinguished name match to
                prevent a man-in-the-middle attack. In Oracle  database,  this
                is  used  as the SSL_SERVER_CERT_DN ; in Microsoft SQL Server,
                this is used as the hostNameInCertificate .

              o CONNECTION_URL  -  The  URL  for  connecting  to   a   general
                (non-JDBC) data source.

              o SECRET_ID  - The secret ID used for the secret manager of cre-
                dentials.

                TOM connection.

              o CONNECTOR_CLASS_NAME - The connector class name for a  MARKET-
                PLACE or CUSTOM connection.

              o KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS  -  A comma-separated list of host and
                port pairs that are the addresses of the Apache Kafka  brokers
                in a Kafka cluster to which a Kafka client will connect to and
                bootstrap itself.

              o KAFKA_SSL_ENABLED - Whether to enable or  disable  SSL  on  an
                Apache Kafka connection. Default value is "true".

              o KAFKA_CUSTOM_CERT  - The Amazon S3 URL for the private CA cert
                file (.pem format). The default is an empty string.

              o KAFKA_SKIP_CUSTOM_CERT_VALIDATION - Whether to skip the  vali-
                dation  of  the  CA cert file or not. Glue validates for three
                algorithms: SHA256withRSA,  SHA384withRSA  and  SHA512withRSA.

              value -> (string)

          PhysicalConnectionRequirements -> (structure)
              A  map of physical connection requirements, such as virtual pri-
              vate cloud (VPC) and SecurityGroup , that  are  needed  to  make
              this connection successfully.

              SubnetId -> (string)
