NAME
       get-crawlers -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves metadata for all crawlers defined in the customer account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-crawlers is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Crawlers

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                            sample rows  from  the  table.  Scanning  all  the
                            records can take a long time when the table is not
                            a high throughput table.

                            A value of true means to scan all records, while a
                            value  of false means to sample the records. If no
                            value is specified, the value defaults to true .

                 DynamoDBTargets -> (list)

                            sample  rows  from  the  table.  Scanning  all the
                            records can take a long time when the table is not
                            a high throughput table.

                            A value of true means to scan all records, while a
                            value of false means to sample the records. If  no
                            value is specified, the value defaults to true .

                        scanRate -> (double)
                            The  percentage  of  the  configured read capacity
                            units to use by the Glue  crawler.  Read  capacity
                            units  is a term defined by DynamoDB, and is a nu-
                            meric value that acts as rate limiter for the num-
                            ber  of  reads that can be performed on that table
                            per second.

                            The valid values are null or a value  between  0.1
                            to  1.5.  A  null value is used when user does not
                            provide a value, and defaults to 0.5 of  the  con-
                            figured  Read  Capacity  Unit (for provisioned ta-
                            bles), or 0.25 of the max configured Read Capacity
                            Unit (for tables using on-demand mode).

                            A list of the tables to be synchronized.

                            metadata files for a Hudi table resides. The  Hudi
                            folder  may  be  located  in a child folder of the
                            root folder.

                            set their connection properties here.
