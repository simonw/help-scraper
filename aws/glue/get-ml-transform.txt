GET-ML-TRANSFORM()                                          GET-ML-TRANSFORM()



NAME
       get-ml-transform -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  an  Glue  machine  learning transform artifact and all its corre-
       sponding metadata. Machine learning transforms are a  special  type  of
       transform  that use machine learning to learn the details of the trans-
       formation to be performed by learning from examples provided by humans.
       These  transformations  are  then saved by Glue. You can retrieve their
       metadata by calling GetMLTransform .

OPTIONS
       --transform-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the transform, generated at the  time  that
          the transform was created.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

              input or output data.

              DatabaseName -> (string)
                 A database name in the Glue Data Catalog.

              TableName -> (string)

                 keys supported:

                 o pushDownPredicate : to filter on partitions without  having
                   to list and read all the files in your dataset.

                 o catalogPartitionPredicate  :  to  use server-side partition

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       Parameters -> (structure)
          The configuration parameters that  are  specific  to  the  algorithm
          used.

          TransformType -> (string)
              The type of machine learning transform.

              For  information about the types of machine learning transforms,
              see Creating Machine Learning Transforms .

          FindMatchesParameters -> (structure)
              The parameters for the find matches algorithm.

              PrimaryKeyColumnName -> (string)
                 The name of a column that uniquely  identifies  rows  in  the
                 source table. Used to help identify matching records.

              PrecisionRecallTradeoff -> (double)
                 The  value  selected when tuning your transform for a balance
                 between precision and recall. A value of 0.5 means no prefer-
                 ence; a value of 1.0 means a bias purely for precision, and a
                 value of 0.0 means a bias  for  recall.  Because  this  is  a
                 tradeoff, choosing values close to 1.0 means very low recall,
                 and choosing values close to 0.0 results in very  low  preci-
                 sion.

                 The  precision  metric indicates how often your model is cor-
                 rect when it predicts a match.

                 The recall metric indicates that for an actual match, how of-
                 ten your model predicts the match.

              AccuracyCostTradeoff -> (double)
                 The  value  that is selected when tuning your transform for a
                 balance between accuracy and cost. A value of 0.5 means  that
                 the  system  balances  accuracy and cost concerns. A value of
                 1.0 means a bias purely for accuracy, which typically results
                 in  a higher cost, sometimes substantially higher. A value of
                 0.0 means a bias purely for cost, which results in a less ac-
                 curate FindMatches transform, sometimes with unacceptable ac-
                 curacy.

                 Accuracy measures how well the transform finds true positives
                 and true negatives. Increasing accuracy requires more machine
                 resources and cost. But it also results in increased recall.

                 Cost measures how many compute resources, and thus money, are
                 consumed to run the transform.

              EnforceProvidedLabels -> (boolean)
                 The  value  to  switch on or off to force the output to match
                 the provided labels from users. If the value is  True  ,  the
                 find  matches  transform  forces the output to match the pro-
                 vided labels. The results override the normal conflation  re-
                 sults.  If  the  value  is False , the find matches transform
                 does not ensure all the labels provided  are  respected,  and
                 the results rely on the trained model.

                 Note that setting this value to true may increase the confla-
                 tion execution time.

       EvaluationMetrics -> (structure)
          The latest evaluation metrics.

          TransformType -> (string)
              The type of machine learning transform.

          FindMatchesMetrics -> (structure)
              The evaluation metrics for the find matches algorithm.

              AreaUnderPRCurve -> (double)
                 The area under the precision/recall curve (AUPRC) is a single
                 number  measuring  the overall quality of the transform, that
                 is independent of the choice made for precision  vs.  recall.
                 Higher values indicate that you have a more attractive preci-
                 sion vs. recall tradeoff.

                 For more information, see Precision and recall in Wikipedia.

              Precision -> (double)
                 The precision metric indicates when often your  transform  is
                 correct  when  it predicts a match. Specifically, it measures
                 how well the transform finds true positives  from  the  total
                 true positives possible.

                 For more information, see Precision and recall in Wikipedia.

              Recall -> (double)
                 The recall metric indicates that for an actual match, how of-
                 ten your transform predicts the match. Specifically, it  mea-
                 sures  how  well  the transform finds true positives from the
                 total records in the source data.

                 For more information, see Precision and recall in Wikipedia.

              F1 -> (double)
                 The maximum F1 metric indicates the transform's accuracy  be-
                 tween 0 and 1, where 1 is the best accuracy.

                 For more information, see F1 score in Wikipedia.

              ConfusionMatrix -> (structure)
                 The  confusion  matrix  shows you what your transform is pre-
                 dicting accurately and what types of errors it is making.

                 For more information, see Confusion matrix in Wikipedia.

                 NumTruePositives -> (long)
                     The number of matches in the data that the transform cor-
                     rectly found, in the confusion matrix for your transform.

                 NumFalsePositives -> (long)
                     The  number  of nonmatches in the data that the transform
                     incorrectly classified as a match, in the  confusion  ma-
                     trix for your transform.

                 NumTrueNegatives -> (long)
                     The  number  of nonmatches in the data that the transform
                     correctly rejected, in  the  confusion  matrix  for  your
                     transform.

                 NumFalseNegatives -> (long)
                     The  number  of  matches  in  the data that the transform
                     didn't find, in the confusion matrix for your transform.

                     tance score for a column.

                     Column importance helps you understand how  columns  con-
                     tribute  to  your  model, by identifying which columns in

          power that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB of mem-
          ory. For more information, see the Glue pricing page .

          When  the  WorkerType  field is set to a value other than Standard ,
          the MaxCapacity field is set automatically and becomes read-only.

       WorkerType -> (string)
          The type of predefined worker that is allocated when this task runs.
          Accepts a value of Standard, G.1X, or G.2X.
