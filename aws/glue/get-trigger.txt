GET-TRIGGER()                                                    GET-TRIGGER()



NAME
       get-trigger -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the definition of a trigger.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-trigger
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the trigger to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          The requested trigger definition.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the trigger.

          WorkflowName -> (string)
              The name of the workflow associated with the trigger.

          Id -> (string)
              Reserved for future use.

          Type -> (string)
              The type of trigger that this is.

          State -> (string)
              The current state of the trigger.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of this trigger.

          Schedule -> (string)
              A cron expression used to specify the schedule  (see  Time-Based
              Schedules  for Jobs and Crawlers . For example, to run something
              every day at 12:15 UTC, you would specify: cron(15 12 * * ? *) .

          Actions -> (list)
              The actions initiated by this trigger.

              (structure)
                 Defines an action to be initiated by a trigger.

                 JobName -> (string)
                     The name of a job to be run.

                 Arguments -> (map)
                     The job arguments used when this trigger fires. For  this
                     job  run,  they  replace the default arguments set in the
                     job definition itself.

                     You can specify arguments here that your  own  job-execu-
                     tion  script consumes, as well as arguments that Glue it-
                     self consumes.

                     For information about how to specify and consume your own
                     Job  arguments, see the Calling Glue APIs in Python topic
                     in the developer guide.

                     For information about the key-value pairs that Glue  con-
                     sumes to set up your job, see the Special Parameters Used
                     by Glue topic in the developer guide.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 Timeout -> (integer)
                     The JobRun timeout in minutes. This is the  maximum  time
                     that  a job run can consume resources before it is termi-
                     nated and enters TIMEOUT status.  The  default  is  2,880
                     minutes  (48 hours). This overrides the timeout value set
                     in the parent job.

                 SecurityConfiguration -> (string)
                     The name of the  SecurityConfiguration  structure  to  be

                     tion.

              Conditions -> (list)
                 A list of the conditions that determine when the trigger will
                 fire.

                        The condition state. Currently, the  only  job  states
                        that  a trigger can listen for are SUCCEEDED , STOPPED
                        , FAILED , and TIMEOUT . The only crawler states  that
                        a  trigger can listen for are SUCCEEDED , FAILED , and

                 Number of events that must be  received  from  Amazon  Event-
                 Bridge before EventBridge event trigger fires.

              BatchWindow -> (integer)
                 Window of time in seconds after which EventBridge event trig-
                 ger fires. Window starts when first event is received.
