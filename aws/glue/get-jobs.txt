GET-JOBS()                                                          GET-JOBS()



NAME
       get-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves all current job definitions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-jobs  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation  by  providing  the --no-paginate argument.  When using --output
       text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query  ar-
       gument  must  extract  data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Jobs

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

                 PythonVersion -> (string)
                     The  Python version being used to run a Python shell job.
                     Allowed values are 2 or 3.

                 Runtime -> (string)
                     In Ray jobs, Runtime is used to specify the  versions  of
                     Ray,  Python  and  additional libraries available in your
                     environment. This field is not used in other  job  types.

                 The default arguments for every run of this job, specified as
                 name-value pairs.

                 You  can  specify  arguments here that your own job-execution
                 script consumes, as well as arguments that Glue  itself  con-
                 sumes.

                 Job arguments may be logged. Do not pass plaintext secrets as
                 arguments. Retrieve secrets from a Glue  Connection,  Secrets
                 Manager or other secret management mechanism if you intend to
                 keep them within the Job.

                 For information about how to specify and consume your own Job
                 arguments,  see  the Calling Glue APIs in Python topic in the
                 developer guide.

                 For information about the arguments you can provide  to  this
                 field when configuring Spark jobs, see the Special Parameters
                 Used by Glue topic in the developer guide.

                 For information about the arguments you can provide  to  this
                 field  when configuring Ray jobs, see Using job parameters in
                 Ray jobs in the developer guide.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              NonOverridableArguments -> (map)
                 Arguments for this job that are not overridden when providing
                 job arguments in a job run, specified as name-value pairs.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              Connections -> (structure)
                 The connections used for this job.

                 Connections -> (list)
                     A list of connections used by the job.

                     (string)

              MaxRetries -> (integer)
                 The  maximum number of times to retry this job after a JobRun
                 fails.

              AllocatedCapacity -> (integer)
                 This field is deprecated. Use MaxCapacity instead.

                 The number of Glue data processing units (DPUs) allocated  to
                 runs  of  this job. You can allocate a minimum of 2 DPUs; the
                 default is 10. A DPU is  a  relative  measure  of  processing
                 power  that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB
                 of memory. For more information, see the Glue pricing page .

              Timeout -> (integer)
                 The job timeout in minutes. This is the maximum time  that  a
                 job run can consume resources before it is terminated and en-
                 ters TIMEOUT status. The default is 2,880 minutes (48  hours)
                 for batch jobs.

                 Streaming  jobs  must have timeout values less than 7 days or
                 10080 minutes. When the value is left blank, the job will  be
                 restarted  after 7 days based if you have not setup a mainte-
                 nance window. If you have setup maintenance window,  it  will
                 be restarted during the maintenance window after 7 days.

              MaxCapacity -> (double)
                 For  Glue  version  1.0  or  earlier jobs, using the standard
                 worker type, the number of Glue data processing units  (DPUs)
                 that can be allocated when this job runs. A DPU is a relative
                 measure of processing power that consists of 4 vCPUs of  com-
                 pute  capacity and 16 GB of memory. For more information, see
                 the Glue pricing page .

                 For Glue version 2.0 or later jobs, you cannot specify a Max-
                 imum capacity . Instead, you should specify a Worker type and
                 the Number of workers .

                 Do not set MaxCapacity if using WorkerType and  NumberOfWork-
                 ers .

                 The  value  that  can be allocated for MaxCapacity depends on
                 whether you are running a Python shell job, an  Apache  Spark
                 ETL job, or an Apache Spark streaming ETL job:

                 o When  you  specify  a  Python  shell  job  (JobCommand.Name
                   ="pythonshell"), you can allocate either 0.0625 or  1  DPU.
                   The default is 0.0625 DPU.

                 o When  you  specify an Apache Spark ETL job (JobCommand.Name
                   ="glueetl") or Apache  Spark  streaming  ETL  job  (JobCom-
                   mand.Name ="gluestreaming"), you can allocate from 2 to 100
                   DPUs. The default is 10 DPUs. This job type cannot  have  a
                   fractional DPU allocation.

              WorkerType -> (string)
                 The  type  of  predefined worker that is allocated when a job
                 runs. Accepts a value of G.1X, G.2X, G.4X, G.8X or G.025X for
                 Spark jobs. Accepts the value Z.2X for Ray jobs.

                 o For  the G.1X worker type, each worker maps to 1 DPU (4 vC-
                   PUs, 16 GB of memory) with 84GB  disk  (approximately  34GB
                   free),  and  provides  1  executor per worker. We recommend
                   this worker type for workloads  such  as  data  transforms,
                   joins, and queries, to offers a scalable and cost effective
                   way to run most jobs.

                 o For the G.2X worker type, each worker maps to 2 DPU (8  vC-
                   PUs,  32  GB of memory) with 128GB disk (approximately 77GB
                   free), and provides 1 executor  per  worker.  We  recommend
                   this  worker  type  for  workloads such as data transforms,
                   joins, and queries, to offers a scalable and cost effective
                   way to run most jobs.

                 o For the G.4X worker type, each worker maps to 4 DPU (16 vC-
                   PUs, 64 GB of memory) with 256GB disk (approximately  235GB
                   free),  and  provides  1  executor per worker. We recommend
                   this worker type for jobs whose workloads contain your most
                   demanding  transforms,  aggregations,  joins,  and queries.
                   This worker type is available only for Glue version 3.0  or
                   later  Spark  ETL jobs in the following Amazon Web Services
                   Regions: US East (Ohio), US East  (N.  Virginia),  US  West
                   (Oregon),  Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney),
                   Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt),
                   Europe (Ireland), and Europe (Stockholm).

                 o For the G.8X worker type, each worker maps to 8 DPU (32 vC-
                   PUs, 128 GB of memory) with 512GB disk (approximately 487GB
                   free),  and  provides  1  executor per worker. We recommend
                   this worker type for jobs whose workloads contain your most
                   demanding  transforms,  aggregations,  joins,  and queries.
                   This worker type is available only for Glue version 3.0  or
                   later  Spark  ETL jobs, in the same Amazon Web Services Re-
                   gions as supported for the G.4X worker type.

                 o For the G.025X worker type, each worker maps to 0.25 DPU (2
                   vCPUs,  4  GB of memory) with 84GB disk (approximately 34GB
                   free), and provides 1 executor  per  worker.  We  recommend
                   this worker type for low volume streaming jobs. This worker
                   type is only available for Glue version 3.0 streaming jobs.

                 o For the Z.2X worker type, each worker maps to 2 M-DPU (8vC-
                   PUs, 64 GB of memory) with 128 GB disk (approximately 120GB
                   free), and provides up to 8 Ray workers based  on  the  au-
                   toscaler.

              NumberOfWorkers -> (integer)
                 The  number of workers of a defined workerType that are allo-
                 cated when a job runs.

              SecurityConfiguration -> (string)
                 The name of the SecurityConfiguration structure  to  be  used
                 with this job.

              NotificationProperty -> (structure)
                 Specifies configuration properties of a job notification.

                 NotifyDelayAfter -> (integer)
                     After a job run starts, the number of minutes to wait be-
                     fore sending a job run delay notification.

              GlueVersion -> (string)
                 In Spark jobs, GlueVersion determines the versions of  Apache
                 Spark  and  Python  that  Glue available in a job. The Python
                 version indicates the version  supported  for  jobs  of  type
                 Spark.

                 Ray  jobs  should set GlueVersion to 4.0 or greater. However,
                 the versions of Ray, Python and additional  libraries  avail-
                 able  in your Ray job are determined by the Runtime parameter
                 of the Job command.

                 For more information about the available  Glue  versions  and
                 corresponding  Spark and Python versions, see Glue version in
                 the developer guide.

                 Jobs that are created without specifying a Glue  version  de-
                 fault to Glue 0.9.

              CodeGenConfigurationNodes -> (map)
                 The  representation of a directed acyclic graph on which both
                 the Glue Studio visual component and Glue Studio code genera-
                 tion is based.

                               example,      the      option     "dataTypeMap-
                               ping":{"FLOAT":"STRING"} maps  data  fields  of
                               JDBC  type  FLOAT  into the Java String type by
                               calling the ResultSet.getString() method of the
                               driver,  and  uses it to build the Glue record.
                               The ResultSet object  is  implemented  by  each
                               driver,  so  the  behavior  is  specific to the
                               driver you use. Refer to the documentation  for
                               your  JDBC  driver to understand how the driver
                               performs the conversions.

                            erally  not  necessary  if the data has a standard
                            file extension. Possible  values  are  "gzip"  and
                            "bzip" ).

                        Exclusions -> (list)
                            A string containing a JSON list of Unix-style glob
                            patterns to exclude. For example, "["
                            **
                            .pdf"]" excludes all PDF files.

                        GroupSize -> (string)
                            The  target  group  size  in bytes. The default is
                            computed based on the input data size and the size
                            of  your cluster. When there are fewer than 50,000
                            input files, "groupFiles" must be set to "inParti-
                            tion" for this to take effect.

                        GroupFiles -> (string)
                            Grouping  files  is  turned on by default when the
                            input contains more than 50,000 files. To turn  on
                            grouping  with  fewer  than 50,000 files, set this
                            parameter to "inPartition".  To  disable  grouping
                            when  there  are  more than 50,000 files, set this
                            parameter to "none" .

                        Recurse -> (boolean)
                            If set to true, recursively  reads  files  in  all
                            subdirectories under the specified paths.

                        MaxBand -> (integer)
                            This  option controls the duration in milliseconds
                            after which the s3 listing is likely to be consis-
                            tent.  Files  with modification timestamps falling
                            within the last maxBand milliseconds  are  tracked
                            specially  when  using JobBookmarks to account for
                            Amazon S3 eventual consistency. Most  users  don't
                            need  to  set  this  option. The default is 900000
                            milliseconds, or 15 minutes.

                        MaxFilesInBand -> (integer)
                            This option specifies the maximum number of  files
                            to  save  from  the  last maxBand seconds. If this
                            number is exceeded, extra files  are  skipped  and
                            only processed in the next job run.

                        AdditionalOptions -> (structure)
                            Specifies additional connection options.

                            BoundedSize -> (long)
                               Sets the upper limit for the target size of the
                               dataset in bytes that will be processed.

                               Sets the upper limit for the target  number  of
                               files that will be processed.

                            EnableSamplePath -> (boolean)
                               Sets option to enable a sample path.

                            SamplePath -> (string)
                               If enabled, specifies the sample path.

                        Separator -> (string)
                            Specifies  the delimiter character. The default is
                            a comma: ",", but any other character can be spec-
                            ified.

                        Escaper -> (string)
                            Specifies  a  character  to use for escaping. This
                            option is used only when reading  CSV  files.  The
                            default  value is none . If enabled, the character
                            which immediately follows is  used  as-is,  except
                            for  a  small set of well-known escapes (\n , \r ,
                            \t , and \0 ).

                        QuoteChar -> (string)
                            Specifies the character to use  for  quoting.  The
                            default is a double quote: '"' . Set this to -1 to
                            turn off quoting entirely.

                        Multiline -> (boolean)
                            A Boolean value that specifies  whether  a  single
                            record  can  span  multiple  lines. This can occur
                            when a field contains a quoted new-line character.
                            You  must  set  this  option to True if any record
                            spans multiple lines. The default value is False ,
                            which  allows  for  more aggressive file-splitting
                            during parsing.

                        WithHeader -> (boolean)

                            the  first  line as a header. The default value is
                            False .

                        WriteHeader -> (boolean)
                            A Boolean value that specifies  whether  to  write
                            the header to output. The default value is True .

                        SkipFirst -> (boolean)
                            A Boolean value that specifies whether to skip the
                            first data line. The default value is False .

                        OptimizePerformance -> (boolean)
                            A Boolean value that specifies whether to use  the
                            advanced  SIMD  CSV reader along with Apache Arrow
                            based columnar memory formats. Only  available  in
                            Glue version 3.0.

                               Specifies  a  user-defined schema when a schema
                               cannot be determined by Glue.

                               Columns -> (list)
                                   Specifies the column definitions that  make
                                   up a Glue schema.

                                   (string)

                        GroupSize -> (string)
                            The target group size in  bytes.  The  default  is
                            computed based on the input data size and the size
                            of your cluster. When there are fewer than  50,000
                            input files, "groupFiles" must be set to "inParti-
                            tion" for this to take effect.

                        GroupFiles -> (string)
                            Grouping files is turned on by  default  when  the
                            input  contains more than 50,000 files. To turn on
                            grouping with fewer than 50,000  files,  set  this
                            parameter  to  "inPartition".  To disable grouping
                            when there are more than 50,000  files,  set  this
                            parameter to "none" .

                        Recurse -> (boolean)

                            tent. Files with modification  timestamps  falling
                            within  the  last maxBand milliseconds are tracked
                            specially when using JobBookmarks to  account  for
                            Amazon  S3  eventual consistency. Most users don't
                            need to set this option.  The  default  is  900000
                            milliseconds, or 15 minutes.

                        MaxFilesInBand -> (integer)
                            This  option specifies the maximum number of files
                            to save from the last  maxBand  seconds.  If  this
                            number  is  exceeded,  extra files are skipped and
                            only processed in the next job run.

                               if the streaming job  has  already  read  extra
                               records  from  Kinesis (in the same get-records
                               call). If MaxFetchRecordsPerShard needs  to  be
                               strict  then  it  needs  to  be  a  multiple of
                               MaxRecordPerRead . The default value is  100000

                               read data from. The possible values are "earli-
                               est" or "latest" . The default value  is  "lat-
                               est" .

                            EndingOffsets -> (string)
                               The end point when a batch query is ended. Pos-

                               tion  between the oldest record received by the
                               topic and the time it arrives in Glue to Cloud-
                               Watch.      The      metric's      name      is
                               "glue.driver.streaming.maxConsumerLagInMs". The
                               default  value  is 'false'. This option is sup-
                               ported in Glue version 4.0 or later.

                               to start reading data from. The possible values
                               are a timestamp string in  UTC  format  of  the
                               pattern  yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SSZ  (where  Z repre-
                               sents a UTC timezone offset with a +/-. For ex-

                            null placeholder unique to the dataset.

                            The  DropNullFields  transform removes custom null
                            values only if both the value of the  null  place-

                            value -> (string)

                        Inputs -> (list)
                            The nodes that are inputs to the data target.

                            (string)

              ExecutionClass -> (string)
                 Indicates  whether the job is run with a standard or flexible
                 execution class. The standard execution class  is  ideal  for
                 time-sensitive  workloads  that  require fast job startup and
                 dedicated resources.

                 The flexible execution class is appropriate for time-insensi-
                 tive jobs whose start and completion times may vary.

                 Only  jobs  with  Glue version 3.0 and above and command type
                 glueetl will be allowed to set ExecutionClass to FLEX  .  The
                 flexible execution class is available for Spark jobs.

              SourceControlDetails -> (structure)

                     The value of an authorization token.

              MaintenanceWindow -> (string)
                 This field specifies a day of the week and hour for a mainte-
                 nance window for streaming jobs. Glue  periodically  performs
                 maintenance  activities.  During  these  maintenance windows,
                 Glue will need to restart your streaming jobs.

                 Glue will restart the job within 3  hours  of  the  specified
                 maintenance  window.  For instance, if you set up the mainte-
                 nance window for Monday at 10:00AM GMT,  your  jobs  will  be
                 restarted between 10:00AM GMT to 1:00PM GMT.
