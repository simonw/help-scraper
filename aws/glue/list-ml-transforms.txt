LIST-ML-TRANSFORMS()                                      LIST-ML-TRANSFORMS()



NAME
       list-ml-transforms -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a sortable, filterable list of existing Glue machine learning
       transforms in this Amazon Web Services account, or the  resources  with
       the  specified tag. This operation takes the optional Tags field, which
       you can use as a filter of the responses so that tagged  resources  can
       be  retrieved  as a group. If you choose to use tag filtering, only re-
       sources with the tags are retrieved.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          [--max-results <value>]
          [--filter <value>]
          [--sort <value>]
          [--tags <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          A continuation token, if this is a continuation request.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum size of a list to return.

       --filter (structure)
          A TransformFilterCriteria used to filter the machine learning trans-
          forms.

          Name -> (string)
              A  unique  transform  name  that  is  used to filter the machine
              learning transforms.

          TransformType -> (string)
              The type of machine learning transform that is  used  to  filter
              the machine learning transforms.

          Status -> (string)
              Filters  the  list  of  machine  learning transforms by the last
              known status of the transforms (to indicate whether a  transform
              can be used or not). One of "NOT_READY", "READY", or "DELETING".

          GlueVersion -> (string)
              This  value determines which version of Glue this machine learn-
              ing transform is compatible with. Glue 1.0  is  recommended  for
              most  customers. If the value is not set, the Glue compatibility
              defaults to Glue 0.9. For more information, see Glue Versions in
              the developer guide.

          CreatedBefore -> (timestamp)
              The time and date before which the transforms were created.

          CreatedAfter -> (timestamp)
              The time and date after which the transforms were created.

          LastModifiedBefore -> (timestamp)
              Filter on transforms last modified before this date.

          LastModifiedAfter -> (timestamp)
              Filter on transforms last modified after this date.

          Schema -> (list)
              Filters  on  datasets  with  a  specific schema. The Map<Column,
              Type> object is an array of  key-value  pairs  representing  the
              schema  this  transform  accepts,  where Column is the name of a
              column, and Type is the type of the data such as an  integer  or
              string. Has an upper bound of 100 columns.

              (structure)
                 A  key-value  pair  representing  a column and data type that
                 this transform can run against. The Schema parameter  of  the
                 MLTransform may contain up to 100 of these structures.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of the column.

                 DataType -> (string)
                     The type of data in the column.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,TransformType=string,Status=string,GlueVersion=string,CreatedBefore=timestamp,CreatedAfter=timestamp,LastModifiedBefore=timestamp,LastModifiedAfter=timestamp,Schema=[{Name=string,DataType=string},{Name=string,DataType=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "string",
            "TransformType": "FIND_MATCHES",

                "DataType": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --sort (structure)
          A  TransformSortCriteria  used  to  sort the machine learning trans-
          forms.

          Column -> (string)
              The column to be used in the sorting criteria that  are  associ-
              ated with the machine learning transform.

          SortDirection -> (string)
              The  sort  direction to be used in the sorting criteria that are
              associated with the machine learning transform.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Column=string,SortDirection=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Column": "NAME"|"TRANSFORM_TYPE"|"STATUS"|"CREATED"|"LAST_MODIFIED",
            "SortDirection": "DESCENDING"|"ASCENDING"
          }

       --tags (map)
          Specifies to return only these tagged resources.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TransformIds -> (list)
          The identifiers of all the machine learning transforms  in  the  ac-
          count, or the machine learning transforms with the specified tags.

          (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          A continuation token, if the returned list does not contain the last
          metric available.
