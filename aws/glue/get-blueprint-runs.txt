GET-BLUEPRINT-RUNS()                                      GET-BLUEPRINT-RUNS()



NAME
       get-blueprint-runs -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the details of blueprint runs for a specified blueprint.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-blueprint-runs
          --blueprint-name <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --blueprint-name (string)
          The name of the blueprint.

       --next-token (string)
          A continuation token, if this is a continuation request.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum size of a list to return.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       BlueprintRuns -> (list)
          Returns a list of BlueprintRun objects.

          (structure)
              The details of a blueprint run.

              BlueprintName -> (string)
                 The name of the blueprint.

              RunId -> (string)
                 The run ID for this blueprint run.

              WorkflowName -> (string)
                 The  name of a workflow that is created as a result of a suc-
                 cessful blueprint run. If a blueprint run has an error, there
                 will not be a workflow created.

              State -> (string)
                 The state of the blueprint run. Possible values are:

                 o Running  The blueprint run is in progress.

                 o Succeeded  The blueprint run completed successfully.

                 o Failed  The blueprint run failed and rollback is complete.

                 o Rolling  Back   The blueprint run failed and rollback is in
                   progress.

              StartedOn -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the blueprint run started.

              CompletedOn -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the blueprint run completed.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 Indicates any errors that are seen while  running  the  blue-
                 print.

              RollbackErrorMessage -> (string)
                 If  there  are  any  errors  while creating the entities of a
                 workflow, we try to roll back the created entities until that
                 point  and  delete  them. This attribute indicates the errors
                 seen while trying to delete the entities that are created.

              Parameters -> (string)
                 The blueprint parameters as a string. You will have  to  pro-
                 vide a value for each key that is required from the parameter
                 spec that is defined in the Blueprint$ParameterSpec .

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The role ARN. This role will be assumed by the  Glue  service
                 and will be used to create the workflow and other entities of
                 a workflow.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A continuation token, if not all blueprint runs have been returned.
