NAME
       get-crawler -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves metadata for a specified crawler.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-crawler
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the crawler to retrieve metadata for.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                        ple rows from the table. Scanning all the records  can

                        put table.

                        The  valid  values  are null or a value between 0.1 to
                        1.5. A null value is used when user does not provide a
                        value,  and defaults to 0.5 of the configured Read Ca-
                        pacity Unit (for provisioned tables), or 0.25  of  the
                        max  configured  Read  Capacity Unit (for tables using
                        on-demand mode).
