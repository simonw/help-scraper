GET-DEV-ENDPOINT()                                          GET-DEV-ENDPOINT()



NAME
       get-dev-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about a specified development endpoint.

       NOTE:
          When  you  create  a development endpoint in a virtual private cloud
          (VPC), Glue returns only a private IP address, and the public IP ad-
          dress  field is not populated. When you create a non-VPC development
          endpoint, Glue returns only a public IP address.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-dev-endpoint
          --endpoint-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --endpoint-name (string)
          Name of the DevEndpoint to retrieve information for.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DevEndpoint -> (structure)
          A DevEndpoint definition.

          EndpointName -> (string)
              The name of the DevEndpoint .

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role used in this De-
              vEndpoint .

          SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              A list of security group identifiers used in this DevEndpoint .

              (string)

          SubnetId -> (string)
              The subnet ID for this DevEndpoint .

          YarnEndpointAddress -> (string)
              The YARN endpoint address used by this DevEndpoint .

          PrivateAddress -> (string)
              A private IP address to access the DevEndpoint within a  VPC  if
              the  DevEndpoint is created within one. The PrivateAddress field
              is present only when you create the DevEndpoint within your VPC.

          ZeppelinRemoteSparkInterpreterPort -> (integer)
              The Apache Zeppelin port for  the  remote  Apache  Spark  inter-
              preter.

          PublicAddress -> (string)
              The  public  IP address used by this DevEndpoint . The PublicAd-
              dress field is present only when you create a  non-virtual  pri-
              vate cloud (VPC) DevEndpoint .

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of this DevEndpoint .

          WorkerType -> (string)
              The  type of predefined worker that is allocated to the develop-
              ment endpoint. Accepts a value of Standard, G.1X, or G.2X.

              o For the Standard worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU,  16
                GB of memory and a 50GB disk, and 2 executors per worker.

              o For  the  G.1X worker type, each worker maps to 1 DPU (4 vCPU,
                16 GB of memory, 64 GB disk),  and  provides  1  executor  per
                worker.  We  recommend  this  worker type for memory-intensive
                jobs.

              o For the G.2X worker type, each worker maps to 2 DPU  (8  vCPU,
                32  GB  of  memory,  128 GB disk), and provides 1 executor per
                worker. We recommend this  worker  type  for  memory-intensive
                jobs.

              Known  issue:  when  a  development endpoint is created with the
              G.2X  WorkerType configuration, the Spark drivers for the devel-
              opment endpoint will run on 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory, and a 64 GB
              disk.

          GlueVersion -> (string)
              Glue version determines the versions of Apache Spark and  Python
              that  Glue  supports.  The  Python version indicates the version
              supported for running your ETL scripts on development endpoints.

              For more information about the available Glue versions and  cor-
              responding  Spark  and  Python versions, see Glue version in the
              developer guide.

              Development endpoints that are created without specifying a Glue
              version default to Glue 0.9.

              You can specify a version of Python support for development end-
              points by using the Arguments parameter in the CreateDevEndpoint
              or  UpdateDevEndpoint  APIs.  If  no arguments are provided, the
              version defaults to Python 2.

          NumberOfWorkers -> (integer)
              The number of workers of a defined workerType that are allocated
              to the development endpoint.

              The  maximum number of workers you can define are 299 for G.1X ,
              and 149 for G.2X .

          NumberOfNodes -> (integer)
              The number of Glue Data Processing  Units  (DPUs)  allocated  to
              this DevEndpoint .

          AvailabilityZone -> (string)
              The AWS Availability Zone where this DevEndpoint is located.

          VpcId -> (string)
              The  ID  of the virtual private cloud (VPC) used by this DevEnd-
              point .

          ExtraPythonLibsS3Path -> (string)
              The paths to one or more Python libraries in an Amazon S3 bucket
              that should be loaded in your DevEndpoint . Multiple values must
              be complete paths separated by a comma.

              NOTE:
                 You can only use pure Python libraries with a  DevEndpoint  .
                 Libraries  that  rely  on  C  extensions,  such as the pandas
                 Python data analysis library, are not currently supported.

          ExtraJarsS3Path -> (string)
              The path to one or more Java .jar files in  an  S3  bucket  that
              should be loaded in your DevEndpoint .

              NOTE:
                 You can only use pure Java/Scala libraries with a DevEndpoint
                 .

          FailureReason -> (string)
              The reason for a current failure in this DevEndpoint .

          LastUpdateStatus -> (string)
              The status of the last update.

          CreatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The point in time at which this DevEndpoint was created.

          LastModifiedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The point in time at which this DevEndpoint was last modified.

          PublicKey -> (string)
              The public key to be used by this  DevEndpoint  for  authentica-
              tion.  This attribute is provided for backward compatibility be-
              cause the recommended attribute to use is public keys.

          PublicKeys -> (list)
              A list of public keys to be used by the DevEndpoints for authen-
              tication. Using this attribute is preferred over a single public
              key because the public keys allow you to have a  different  pri-
              vate key per client.

              NOTE:
                 If  you previously created an endpoint with a public key, you
                 must remove that key to be able to set a list of public keys.
                 Call  the UpdateDevEndpoint API operation with the public key
                 content in the deletePublicKeys attribute, and  the  list  of
                 new keys in the addPublicKeys attribute.

              (string)

          SecurityConfiguration -> (string)
              The  name of the SecurityConfiguration structure to be used with
              this DevEndpoint .

          Arguments -> (map)
              A map of arguments used to configure the DevEndpoint .

              Valid arguments are:

              o "--enable-glue-datacatalog": ""

              You can specify a version of Python support for development end-
              points by using the Arguments parameter in the CreateDevEndpoint
              or UpdateDevEndpoint APIs. If no  arguments  are  provided,  the
              version defaults to Python 2.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)
