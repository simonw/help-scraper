                     The  path  of  the  Amazon  DocumentDB  or MongoDB target
                     (database/collection).

                 ScanAll -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether to scan all the records, or  to  sample
                     rows  from the table. Scanning all the records can take a
                     long time when the table is not a high throughput table.

                     A value of true means to scan all records, while a  value
                     of  false  means  to  sample  the records. If no value is
                     specified, the value defaults to true .

                     rows  from the table. Scanning all the records can take a
                     long time when the table is not a high throughput table.

                     A value of true means to scan all records, while a  value
                     of  false  means  to  sample  the records. If no value is
                     specified, the value defaults to true .

                 scanRate -> (double)
                     The percentage of the configured read capacity  units  to
                     use  by  the  Glue crawler. Read capacity units is a term
                     defined by DynamoDB, and is a numeric value that acts  as
                     rate  limiter  for  the  number of reads that can be per-
                     formed on that table per second.

                     The valid values are null or a value between 0.1 to  1.5.
                     A  null value is used when user does not provide a value,
                     and defaults to 0.5 of the configured Read Capacity  Unit
                     (for  provisioned  tables), or 0.25 of the max configured
                     Read Capacity Unit (for tables using on-demand mode).

                 EventQueueArn -> (string)

                 DlqEventQueueArn -> (string)
                     A  valid  Amazon  dead-letter  SQS  ARN.   For   example,

                 CreateNativeDeltaTable -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether the crawler will create native  tables,
                     to  allow  integration  with  query  engines that support
                     querying of the Delta transaction log directly.

          IcebergTargets -> (list)
              Specifies Apache Iceberg data store targets.

                     traverse  to discover the Iceberg metadata folder in your
                     Amazon S3 path. Used to limit the crawler run time.

          HudiTargets -> (list)
              Specifies Apache Hudi data store targets.

              (structure)

                     in a child folder of the root folder.

                     The crawler will scan all folders underneath a path for a

                 Exclusions -> (list)
                     A  list  of glob patterns used to exclude from the crawl.
