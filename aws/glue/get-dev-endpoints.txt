GET-DEV-ENDPOINTS()                                        GET-DEV-ENDPOINTS()



NAME
       get-dev-endpoints -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves all the development endpoints in this AWS account.

       NOTE:
          When  you  create  a development endpoint in a virtual private cloud
          (VPC), Glue returns only a private IP address and the public IP  ad-
          dress  field is not populated. When you create a non-VPC development
          endpoint, Glue returns only a public IP address.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-dev-endpoints is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: DevEndpoints

SYNOPSIS
            get-dev-endpoints
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DevEndpoints -> (list)
          A list of DevEndpoint definitions.

          (structure)
              A development endpoint where a developer can remotely debug  ex-
              tract, transform, and load (ETL) scripts.

              EndpointName -> (string)
                 The name of the DevEndpoint .

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role used in this
                 DevEndpoint .

              SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                 A list of security group identifiers used in this DevEndpoint
                 .

                 (string)

              SubnetId -> (string)
                 The subnet ID for this DevEndpoint .

              YarnEndpointAddress -> (string)
                 The YARN endpoint address used by this DevEndpoint .

              PrivateAddress -> (string)
                 A  private  IP address to access the DevEndpoint within a VPC
                 if the DevEndpoint is created within one. The  PrivateAddress
                 field  is present only when you create the DevEndpoint within
                 your VPC.

              ZeppelinRemoteSparkInterpreterPort -> (integer)
                 The Apache Zeppelin port for the remote Apache  Spark  inter-
                 preter.

              PublicAddress -> (string)
                 The  public  IP address used by this DevEndpoint . The Publi-
                 cAddress field is present only when you create a  non-virtual
                 private cloud (VPC) DevEndpoint .

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status of this DevEndpoint .

              WorkerType -> (string)
                 The type of predefined worker that is allocated to the devel-
                 opment endpoint. Accepts a value of Standard, G.1X, or G.2X.

                 o For the Standard worker type, each worker provides 4  vCPU,
                   16  GB  of  memory  and  a  50GB  disk, and 2 executors per
                   worker.

                 o For the G.1X worker type, each worker  maps  to  1  DPU  (4
                   vCPU, 16 GB of memory, 64 GB disk), and provides 1 executor
                   per worker. We recommend this worker type for memory-inten-
                   sive jobs.

                 o For  the  G.2X  worker  type,  each worker maps to 2 DPU (8
                   vCPU, 32 GB of memory, 128 GB disk), and provides 1  execu-
                   tor  per  worker.  We  recommend  this worker type for mem-
                   ory-intensive jobs.

                 Known issue: when a development endpoint is created with  the
                 G.2X  WorkerType configuration, the Spark drivers for the de-
                 velopment endpoint will run on 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory, and a
                 64 GB disk.

              GlueVersion -> (string)
                 Glue  version  determines  the  versions  of Apache Spark and
                 Python that Glue supports. The Python version  indicates  the
                 version supported for running your ETL scripts on development
                 endpoints.

                 For more information about the available  Glue  versions  and
                 corresponding  Spark and Python versions, see Glue version in
                 the developer guide.

                 Development endpoints that are created without  specifying  a
                 Glue version default to Glue 0.9.

                 You  can  specify a version of Python support for development
                 endpoints by using the Arguments parameter in  the  CreateDe-
                 vEndpoint or UpdateDevEndpoint APIs. If no arguments are pro-
                 vided, the version defaults to Python 2.

              NumberOfWorkers -> (integer)
                 The number of workers of a defined workerType that are  allo-
                 cated to the development endpoint.

                 The maximum number of workers you can define are 299 for G.1X
                 , and 149 for G.2X .

              NumberOfNodes -> (integer)
                 The number of Glue Data Processing Units (DPUs) allocated  to
                 this DevEndpoint .

              AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                 The AWS Availability Zone where this DevEndpoint is located.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of  the virtual private cloud (VPC) used by this De-
                 vEndpoint .

              ExtraPythonLibsS3Path -> (string)
                 The paths to one or more Python libraries  in  an  Amazon  S3
                 bucket  that  should be loaded in your DevEndpoint . Multiple
                 values must be complete paths separated by a comma.

                 NOTE:
                     You can only use pure Python libraries with a DevEndpoint
                     . Libraries that rely on C extensions, such as the pandas
                     Python data analysis  library,  are  not  currently  sup-
                     ported.

              ExtraJarsS3Path -> (string)
                 The  path to one or more Java .jar files in an S3 bucket that
                 should be loaded in your DevEndpoint .

                 NOTE:
                     You can only use pure Java/Scala libraries with a DevEnd-
                     point .

              FailureReason -> (string)
                 The reason for a current failure in this DevEndpoint .

              LastUpdateStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the last update.

              CreatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The point in time at which this DevEndpoint was created.

              LastModifiedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  point  in  time at which this DevEndpoint was last modi-
                 fied.

              PublicKey -> (string)
                 The public key to be used by this DevEndpoint for authentica-
                 tion.  This  attribute is provided for backward compatibility
                 because the recommended attribute to use is public keys.

              PublicKeys -> (list)
                 A list of public keys to be used by the DevEndpoints for  au-
                 thentication. Using this attribute is preferred over a single
                 public key because the public keys allow you to have  a  dif-
                 ferent private key per client.

                 NOTE:
                     If  you previously created an endpoint with a public key,
                     you must remove that key to be able to set a list of pub-
                     lic  keys.  Call the UpdateDevEndpoint API operation with
                     the public key content in the deletePublicKeys attribute,
                     and the list of new keys in the addPublicKeys attribute.

                 (string)

              SecurityConfiguration -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the SecurityConfiguration structure to be used
                 with this DevEndpoint .

              Arguments -> (map)
                 A map of arguments used to configure the DevEndpoint .

                 Valid arguments are:

                 o "--enable-glue-datacatalog": ""

                 You can specify a version of Python support  for  development
                 endpoints  by  using the Arguments parameter in the CreateDe-
                 vEndpoint or UpdateDevEndpoint APIs. If no arguments are pro-
                 vided, the version defaults to Python 2.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  continuation  token,  if not all DevEndpoint definitions have yet
          been returned.
