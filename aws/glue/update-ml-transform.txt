NAME
       update-ml-transform -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  an existing machine learning transform. Call this operation to
       tune the algorithm parameters to achieve better results.

       After calling this operation, you can call the StartMLEvaluationTaskRun
       operation  to  assess  how well your new parameters achieved your goals
       (such as improving the quality of your machine learning  transform,  or
       making it more cost-effective).

OPTIONS
       --transform-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier that was generated when the transform was cre-
          ated.

       --name (string)
          The unique name that you gave the transform when you created it.

       --description (string)
          A description of the transform. The default is an empty string.

       --parameters (structure)
          The configuration parameters that are specific to the transform type
          (algorithm) used. Conditionally dependent on the transform type.

          TransformType -> (string)
              The type of machine learning transform.

              For  information about the types of machine learning transforms,
              see Creating Machine Learning Transforms .

          FindMatchesParameters -> (structure)
              The parameters for the find matches algorithm.

              PrimaryKeyColumnName -> (string)
                 The name of a column that uniquely  identifies  rows  in  the
                 source table. Used to help identify matching records.

              PrecisionRecallTradeoff -> (double)
                 The  value  selected when tuning your transform for a balance
                 between precision and recall. A value of 0.5 means no prefer-
                 ence; a value of 1.0 means a bias purely for precision, and a
                 value of 0.0 means a bias  for  recall.  Because  this  is  a
                 tradeoff, choosing values close to 1.0 means very low recall,
                 and choosing values close to 0.0 results in very  low  preci-
                 sion.

                 The  precision  metric indicates how often your model is cor-
                 rect when it predicts a match.

                 The recall metric indicates that for an actual match, how of-
                 ten your model predicts the match.

              AccuracyCostTradeoff -> (double)
                 The  value  that is selected when tuning your transform for a
                 balance between accuracy and cost. A value of 0.5 means  that
                 the  system  balances  accuracy and cost concerns. A value of
                 1.0 means a bias purely for accuracy, which typically results
                 in  a higher cost, sometimes substantially higher. A value of
                 0.0 means a bias purely for cost, which results in a less ac-
                 curate FindMatches transform, sometimes with unacceptable ac-
                 curacy.

                 Accuracy measures how well the transform finds true positives
                 and true negatives. Increasing accuracy requires more machine
                 resources and cost. But it also results in increased recall.

                 Cost measures how many compute resources, and thus money, are
                 consumed to run the transform.

              EnforceProvidedLabels -> (boolean)
                 The  value  to  switch on or off to force the output to match
                 the provided labels from users. If the value is  True  ,  the
                 find  matches  transform  forces the output to match the pro-
                 vided labels. The results override the normal conflation  re-
                 sults.  If  the  value  is False , the find matches transform
                 does not ensure all the labels provided  are  respected,  and
                 the results rely on the trained model.

                 Note that setting this value to true may increase the confla-
                 tion execution time.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TransformType=string,FindMatchesParameters={PrimaryKeyColumnName=string,PrecisionRecallTradeoff=double,AccuracyCostTradeoff=double,EnforceProvidedLabels=boolean}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TransformType": "FIND_MATCHES",
            "FindMatchesParameters": {
              "PrimaryKeyColumnName": "string",
              "PrecisionRecallTradeoff": double,
              "AccuracyCostTradeoff": double,
              "EnforceProvidedLabels": true|false
            }
          }

       --role (string)
          The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role with the  re-
          quired permissions.

       --glue-version (string)
          This  value  determines  which version of Glue this machine learning
          transform is compatible with. Glue 1.0 is recommended for most  cus-
          tomers.  If the value is not set, the Glue compatibility defaults to
          Glue 0.9. For more information, see Glue Versions in  the  developer
          guide.

       --max-capacity (double)
          The  number  of Glue data processing units (DPUs) that are allocated
          to task runs for this transform. You can  allocate  from  2  to  100
          DPUs;  the  default is 10. A DPU is a relative measure of processing
          power that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB of mem-
          ory. For more information, see the Glue pricing page .

          When  the  WorkerType  field is set to a value other than Standard ,
          the MaxCapacity field is set automatically and becomes read-only.

       --worker-type (string)
          The type of predefined worker that is allocated when this task runs.
          Accepts a value of Standard, G.1X, or G.2X.

          o For  the  Standard worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB
            of memory and a 50GB disk, and 2 executors per worker.

          o For the G.1X worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU,  16  GB  of
            memory and a 64GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.

          o For  the  G.2X  worker type, each worker provides 8 vCPU, 32 GB of
            memory and a 128GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.

          Possible values:

          o Standard

          o G.1X

          o G.2X

       --number-of-workers (integer)
          The number of workers of a defined  workerType  that  are  allocated
          when this task runs.

       --timeout (integer)
          The  timeout  for  a task run for this transform in minutes. This is
          the maximum time that a task run for this transform can consume  re-
          sources  before  it is terminated and enters TIMEOUT status. The de-
          fault is 2,880 minutes (48 hours).

       --max-retries (integer)
          The maximum number of times to retry a task for this transform after
          a task run fails.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TransformId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the transform that was updated.
