NAME
       start-import-labels-task-run -

DESCRIPTION
       Enables you to provide additional labels (examples of truth) to be used
       to teach the machine learning transform and improve its  quality.  This
       API operation is generally used as part of the active learning workflow
       that starts with the StartMLLabelingSetGenerationTaskRun call and  that
       ultimately  results  in  improving the quality of your machine learning
       transform.

       After the StartMLLabelingSetGenerationTaskRun  finishes,  Glue  machine
       learning  will  have  generated a series of questions for humans to an-
       swer. (Answering these questions is often called 'labeling' in the  ma-
       chine  learning  workflows).  In the case of the FindMatches transform,
       these questions are of the form, What is the correct way to group these
       rows  together into groups composed entirely of matching records? After
       the labeling process is finished,  users  upload  their  answers/labels
       with  a  call  to  StartImportLabelsTaskRun  .  After StartImportLabel-
       sTaskRun finishes, all future runs of the  machine  learning  transform
       use  the new and improved labels and perform a higher-quality transfor-
       mation.

       By default, StartMLLabelingSetGenerationTaskRun continually learns from
       and combines all labels that you upload unless you set Replace to true.
       If you set Replace to true, StartImportLabelsTaskRun deletes  and  for-
       gets  all previously uploaded labels and learns only from the exact set
       that you upload. Replacing labels can be helpful if  you  realize  that
       you previously uploaded incorrect labels, and you believe that they are
       having a negative effect on your transform quality.

       You can check on the status of your task  run  by  calling  the  GetML-
       TaskRun operation.

SYNOPSIS
            start-import-labels-task-run
          --transform-id <value>
          --input-s3-path <value>
          [--replace-all-labels | --no-replace-all-labels]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --transform-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the machine learning transform.

       --input-s3-path (string)
          The  Amazon  Simple  Storage Service (Amazon S3) path from where you
          import the labels.

       --replace-all-labels | --no-replace-all-labels (boolean)
          Indicates whether to overwrite your existing labels.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TaskRunId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the task run.
