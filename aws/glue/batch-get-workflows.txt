NAME
       batch-get-workflows -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of resource metadata for a given list of workflow names.
       After calling the ListWorkflows operation, you can call this  operation
       to access the data to which you have been granted permissions. This op-
       eration supports all IAM permissions, including  permission  conditions
       that uses tags.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-get-workflows
          --names <value>
          [--include-graph | --no-include-graph]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --names (list)
          A  list  of workflow names, which may be the names returned from the
          ListWorkflows operation.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --include-graph | --no-include-graph (boolean)
          Specifies whether to include a graph when returning the workflow re-
          source metadata.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                                          units  (DPUs)  that can be allocated
                                          when this job runs. A DPU is a rela-
                                          tive  measure  of  processing  power
                                          that consists of 4 vCPUs of  compute
                                          capacity  and  16  GB of memory. For

                                          The value that can be allocated  for
                                          MaxCapacity  depends  on whether you
                                          are running a Python shell job or an
                                          Apache Spark ETL job:

                                            ="glueetl"), you can allocate from
                                            2 to 100 DPUs. The default  is  10
                                            DPUs.  This job type cannot have a
                                            fractional DPU allocation.

                                      (DPUs)  that  can be allocated when this
                                      job runs. A DPU is a relative measure of
                                      processing  power that consists of 4 vC-
                                      PUs of compute capacity  and  16  GB  of
                                      memory.  For  more  information, see the
                                      Glue pricing page .

                                      Do not set Max Capacity if using Worker-
                                      Type and NumberOfWorkers .

                                      The value that can be allocated for Max-
                                      Capacity depends on whether you are run-
                                      ning  a  Python  shell  job or an Apache
                                      Spark ETL job:

                                      o When you specify a  Python  shell  job
                                        (JobCommand.Name  ="pythonshell"), you
                                        can allocate either 0.0625 or  1  DPU.
                                        The default is 0.0625 DPU.

                                      o When  you  specify an Apache Spark ETL
                                        job (JobCommand.Name ="glueetl"),  you
                                        can  allocate  from 2 to 100 DPUs. The
                                        default is 10 DPUs. This job type can-
                                        not have a fractional DPU allocation.

                                   WorkerType -> (string)
                                      The  type  of  predefined worker that is

                                      value of Standard, G.1X, or G.2X.

                                      o For  the  Standard  worker  type, each
                                        worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of  mem-
                                        ory  and  a 50GB disk, and 2 executors
                                        per worker.

                                      o For the G.1X worker type, each  worker
                                        provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory and a
                                        64GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.

                                      o For the G.2X worker type, each  worker
                                        provides 8 vCPU, 32 GB of memory and a
                                        128GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.

                                      This name can be  /aws-glue/jobs/  ,  in
                                      which  case  the  default  encryption is
                                      NONE . If you add a role name and  Secu-

                                      version   supported  for  jobs  of  type
                                      Spark.

                                      For more information about the available

                                   DPUSeconds -> (double)
                                      This field populates only when  an  Auto
                                      Scaling  job  run  completes, and repre-
                                      sents the total time each  executor  ran
                                      during  the  lifecycle  of  a job run in
                                      seconds, multiplied by a DPU  factor  (1
                                      for  G.1X  and 2 for G.2X workers). This
                                      value may be different than  the  execu-
                                      tionEngineRuntime  *  MaxCapacity  as in
                                      the case of Auto Scaling  jobs,  as  the
                                      number  of  executors running at a given
                                      time may be less than the MaxCapacity  .
                                      Therefore, it is possible that the value
                                      of DPUSeconds  is  less  than  executio-
                                      nEngineRuntime * MaxCapacity .
