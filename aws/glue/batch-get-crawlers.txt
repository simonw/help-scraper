BATCH-GET-CRAWLERS()                                      BATCH-GET-CRAWLERS()



NAME
       batch-get-crawlers -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of resource metadata for a given list of crawler names.
       After calling the ListCrawlers operation, you can call  this  operation
       to access the data to which you have been granted permissions. This op-
       eration supports all IAM permissions, including  permission  conditions
       that uses tags.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-get-crawlers
          --crawler-names <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --crawler-names (list)
          A  list of crawler names, which might be the names returned from the
          ListCrawlers operation.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                            sample  rows  from  the  table.  Scanning  all the

                            a high throughput table.

                            A value of true means to scan all records, while a
                            value of false means to sample the records. If  no

                            records can take a long time when the table is not
                            a high throughput table.

                            A value of true means to scan all records, while a
                            value  of false means to sample the records. If no
                            value is specified, the value defaults to true .

                            The percentage of  the  configured  read  capacity
                            units  to  use  by the Glue crawler. Read capacity
                            units is a term defined by DynamoDB, and is a  nu-
                            meric value that acts as rate limiter for the num-
                            ber of reads that can be performed on  that  table
                            per second.

                            The  valid  values are null or a value between 0.1
                            to 1.5. A null value is used when  user  does  not
                            provide  a  value, and defaults to 0.5 of the con-
                            figured Read Capacity Unit  (for  provisioned  ta-
                            bles), or 0.25 of the max configured Read Capacity
