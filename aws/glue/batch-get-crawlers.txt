NAME
       batch-get-crawlers -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of resource metadata for a given list of crawler names.
       After calling the ListCrawlers operation, you can call  this  operation
       to access the data to which you have been granted permissions. This op-
       eration supports all IAM permissions, including  permission  conditions
       that uses tags.

OPTIONS
       --crawler-names (list)
          A  list of crawler names, which might be the names returned from the
          ListCrawlers operation.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                            sample rows  from  the  table.  Scanning  all  the

                            a high throughput table.

                            A value of true means to scan all records, while a
                            value  of false means to sample the records. If no
                            value is specified, the value defaults to true .

                 DynamoDBTargets -> (list)

                            sample  rows  from  the  table.  Scanning  all the
                            records can take a long time when the table is not
                            a high throughput table.

                            A value of true means to scan all records, while a
                            value of false means to sample the records. If  no
                            value is specified, the value defaults to true .

                        scanRate -> (double)
                            The  percentage  of  the  configured read capacity
                            units to use by the Glue  crawler.  Read  capacity
                            units  is a term defined by DynamoDB, and is a nu-
                            meric value that acts as rate limiter for the num-
                            ber  of  reads that can be performed on that table
                            per second.

                            The valid values are null or a value  between  0.1
                            to  1.5.  A  null value is used when user does not
                            provide a value, and defaults to 0.5 of  the  con-
                            figured  Read  Capacity  Unit (for provisioned ta-
                            bles), or 0.25 of the max configured Read Capacity
                            Unit (for tables using on-demand mode).

                            Data Catalog table to be a  target  of  the  crawl
