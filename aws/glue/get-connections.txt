GET-CONNECTIONS()                                            GET-CONNECTIONS()



NAME
       get-connections -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a list of connection definitions from the Data Catalog.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-connections is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: ConnectionList

SYNOPSIS
            get-connections
          [--catalog-id <value>]
          [--filter <value>]
          [--hide-password | --no-hide-password]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The ID of the Data Catalog in which the connections reside. If  none
          is provided, the Amazon Web Services account ID is used by default.

       --filter (structure)
          A filter that controls which connections are returned.

          MatchCriteria -> (list)
              A  criteria  string that must match the criteria recorded in the
              connection definition for that connection definition to  be  re-
              turned.

              (string)

          ConnectionType -> (string)
              The  type  of connections to return. Currently, SFTP is not sup-
              ported.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MatchCriteria=string,string,ConnectionType=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MatchCriteria": ["string", ...],
            "ConnectionType": "JDBC"|"SFTP"|"MONGODB"|"KAFKA"|"NETWORK"|"MARKETPLACE"|"CUSTOM"
          }

       --hide-password | --no-hide-password (boolean)
          Allows you to retrieve the connection metadata without returning the
          password.  For  instance, the AWS Glue console uses this flag to re-
          trieve the connection, and does not display the password.  Set  this
          parameter  when  the caller might not have permission to use the KMS
          key to decrypt the password, but it does have permission  to  access
          the rest of the connection properties.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              ConnectionProperties -> (map)
                 These key-value pairs define parameters for the connection:

                 o HOST - The host URI: either the fully qualified domain name
                   (FQDN) or the IPv4 address of the database host.

                 o PORT - The port number, between 1024 and 65535, of the port
                   on which the database host is listening for  database  con-
                   nections.

                 o USER_NAME - The name under which to log in to the database.
                   The value string for USER_NAME is "USERNAME ".

                 o PASSWORD - A password, if one is used, for the user name.

                 o ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD - When you  enable  connection  password
                   protection  by  setting ConnectionPasswordEncryption in the
                   Data Catalog encryption settings, this field stores the en-
                   crypted password.

                 o JDBC_DRIVER_JAR_URI  -  The  Amazon  Simple Storage Service
                   (Amazon S3) path of the JAR file  that  contains  the  JDBC
                   driver to use.

                 o JDBC_DRIVER_CLASS_NAME  - The class name of the JDBC driver
                   to use.

                 o JDBC_ENGINE - The name of the JDBC engine to use.

                 o JDBC_ENGINE_VERSION - The version of  the  JDBC  engine  to
                   use.

                 o CONFIG_FILES - (Reserved for future use.)

                 o INSTANCE_ID - The instance ID to use.

                 o JDBC_CONNECTION_URL - The URL for connecting to a JDBC data
                   source.

                 o JDBC_ENFORCE_SSL - A Boolean string (true, false)  specify-
                   ing whether Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) with hostname match-
                   ing is enforced for the JDBC connection on the client.  The
                   default is false.

                 o CUSTOM_JDBC_CERT  -  An  Amazon  S3 location specifying the
                   customer's root certificate. Glue uses this  root  certifi-
                   cate  to validate the customers certificate when connecting
                   to the customer database. Glue only handles X.509  certifi-
                   cates.  The  certificate  provided  must be DER-encoded and
                   supplied in Base64 encoding PEM format.

                 o SKIP_CUSTOM_JDBC_CERT_VALIDATION  -  By  default,  this  is
                   false  . Glue validates the Signature algorithm and Subject
                   Public Key Algorithm for the customer certificate. The only
                   permitted   algorithms  for  the  Signature  algorithm  are
                   SHA256withRSA, SHA384withRSA or SHA512withRSA. For the Sub-
                   ject  Public Key Algorithm, the key length must be at least
                   2048. You can set the value of this  property  to  true  to
                   skip Glues validation of the customer certificate.

                 o CUSTOM_JDBC_CERT_STRING  - A custom JDBC certificate string
                   which is used for domain match or distinguished name  match
                   to  prevent a man-in-the-middle attack. In Oracle database,
                   this is used as the SSL_SERVER_CERT_DN ; in  Microsoft  SQL
                   Server, this is used as the hostNameInCertificate .

                 o CONNECTION_URL  -  The  URL  for  connecting  to  a general
                   (non-JDBC) data source.

                 o KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS - A comma-separated  list  of  host
                   and  port  pairs that are the addresses of the Apache Kafka
                   brokers in a Kafka cluster to which  a  Kafka  client  will
                   connect to and bootstrap itself.

                 o KAFKA_SSL_ENABLED  - Whether to enable or disable SSL on an
                   Apache Kafka connection. Default value is "true".

                 o KAFKA_CUSTOM_CERT - The Amazon S3 URL for  the  private  CA
                   cert file (.pem format). The default is an empty string.

                 o KAFKA_SKIP_CUSTOM_CERT_VALIDATION  -  Whether  to  skip the
                   validation of the CA cert file or not. Glue  validates  for
                   three    algorithms:   SHA256withRSA,   SHA384withRSA   and
                   SHA512withRSA. Default value is "false".

                 o SECRET_ID - The secret ID used for the  secret  manager  of
                   credentials.

                 o CONNECTOR_URL - The connector URL for a MARKETPLACE or CUS-
                   TOM connection.

                 o CONNECTOR_TYPE - The connector type for  a  MARKETPLACE  or
                   CUSTOM connection.

                 o CONNECTOR_CLASS_NAME  - The connector class name for a MAR-
                   KETPLACE or CUSTOM connection.

                 o KAFKA_CLIENT_KEYSTORE -  The  Amazon  S3  location  of  the
                   client  keystore  file for Kafka client side authentication
                   (Optional).

                 o KAFKA_CLIENT_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD - The password to access the
                   provided keystore (Optional).

                 o KAFKA_CLIENT_KEY_PASSWORD  - A keystore can consist of mul-
                   tiple keys, so this is the password to  access  the  client
                   key to be used with the Kafka server side key (Optional).

                 o ENCRYPTED_KAFKA_CLIENT_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD  -  The  encrypted
                   version of the Kafka client keystore password (if the  user
                   has the Glue encrypt passwords setting selected).

                 o ENCRYPTED_KAFKA_CLIENT_KEY_PASSWORD - The encrypted version
                   of the Kafka client key password (if the user has the  Glue
                   encrypt passwords setting selected).

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              PhysicalConnectionRequirements -> (structure)
                 A  map  of  physical connection requirements, such as virtual
                 private cloud (VPC) and SecurityGroup , that  are  needed  to
                 make this connection successfully.

                 SubnetId -> (string)
                     The subnet ID used by the connection.

                 SecurityGroupIdList -> (list)
                     The security group ID list used by the connection.

                     (string)

                 AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                     The  connection's Availability Zone. This field is redun-
                     dant because the specified subnet implies the  Availabil-
                     ity  Zone  to  be used. Currently the field must be popu-
                     lated, but it will be deprecated in the future.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that this connection definition was created.

              LastUpdatedBy -> (string)
                 The user, group, or role that last  updated  this  connection
                 definition.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  continuation  token, if the list of connections returned does not
          include the last of the filtered connections.
