NAME
       get-data-catalog-encryption-settings -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the security configuration for a specified catalog.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-data-catalog-encryption-settings
          [--catalog-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the Data Catalog to retrieve the security configuration
          for. If none is provided, the Amazon Web Services account ID is used
          by default.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DataCatalogEncryptionSettings -> (structure)
          The requested security configuration.

          EncryptionAtRest -> (structure)
              Specifies the encryption-at-rest configuration for the Data Cat-
              alog.

              CatalogEncryptionMode -> (string)
                 The encryption-at-rest mode for encrypting Data Catalog data.

              SseAwsKmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The ID of the KMS key to use for encryption at rest.

          ConnectionPasswordEncryption -> (structure)
              When connection password protection is enabled, the Data Catalog
              uses  a customer-provided key to encrypt the password as part of
              CreateConnection or UpdateConnection and store  it  in  the  EN-
              CRYPTED_PASSWORD field in the connection properties. You can en-
              able catalog encryption or only password encryption.

              ReturnConnectionPasswordEncrypted -> (boolean)
                 When the ReturnConnectionPasswordEncrypted  flag  is  set  to
                 "true",  passwords  remain encrypted in the responses of Get-
                 Connection and GetConnections . This encryption takes  effect
                 independently from catalog encryption.

              AwsKmsKeyId -> (string)
                 An KMS key that is used to encrypt the connection password.

                 If  connection  password protection is enabled, the caller of
                 CreateConnection and UpdateConnection needs at least  kms:En-
                 crypt  permission  on the specified KMS key, to encrypt pass-
                 words before storing them in the Data Catalog.

                 You can set the decrypt permission to enable or restrict  ac-
                 cess  on the password key according to your security require-
                 ments.
