GET-JOB-RUNS()                                                  GET-JOB-RUNS()



NAME
       get-job-runs -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves metadata for all runs of a given job definition.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-job-runs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: JobRuns

SYNOPSIS
            get-job-runs
          --job-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-name (string)
          The name of the job definition for which to retrieve all job runs.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

                 they  replace the default arguments set in the job definition
                 itself.

                 You can specify arguments here that  your  own  job-execution
                 script  consumes,  as well as arguments that Glue itself con-
                 sumes.

                 For information about how to specify and consume your own job
                 arguments,  see  the Calling Glue APIs in Python topic in the
                 developer guide.

                 For information about the key-value pairs that Glue  consumes
                 to  set  up your job, see the Special Parameters Used by Glue
                 topic in the developer guide.

                 A list of predecessors to this job run.

                 (structure)
                     A job run that was used in the predicate of a conditional
                     trigger that triggered this job run.

                     JobName -> (string)
                        The name of the job definition used by the predecessor
                        job run.

                     RunId -> (string)
                        The job-run ID of the predecessor job run.

              AllocatedCapacity -> (integer)
                 This field is deprecated. Use MaxCapacity instead.

                 The number of Glue data processing units (DPUs) allocated  to
                 this JobRun. From 2 to 100 DPUs can be allocated; the default
                 is 10. A DPU is a relative measure of processing  power  that
                 consists  of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB of memory.
                 For more information, see the Glue pricing page .

              ExecutionTime -> (integer)
                 The amount of time (in seconds) that the job run consumed re-
                 sources.

              Timeout -> (integer)
                 The  JobRun timeout in minutes. This is the maximum time that
                 a job run can consume resources before it is  terminated  and
                 enters  TIMEOUT  status.  The  default  is  2,880 minutes (48
                 hours). This overrides the timeout value set  in  the  parent
                 job.

              MaxCapacity -> (double)
                 The  number  of Glue data processing units (DPUs) that can be
                 allocated when this job runs. A DPU is a relative measure  of
                 processing power that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity
                 and 16 GB of memory. For more information, see the Glue pric-
                 ing page .

                 Do not set Max Capacity if using WorkerType and NumberOfWork-
                 ers .

                 The value that can be allocated for  MaxCapacity  depends  on
                 whether you are running a Python shell job or an Apache Spark
                 ETL job:

                 o When  you  specify  a  Python  shell  job  (JobCommand.Name
                   ="pythonshell"),  you  can allocate either 0.0625 or 1 DPU.
                   The default is 0.0625 DPU.

                 o When you specify an Apache Spark ETL  job  (JobCommand.Name
                   ="glueetl"),  you can allocate a minimum of 2 DPUs. The de-
                   fault is 10 DPUs. This job type cannot  have  a  fractional
                   DPU allocation.

              WorkerType -> (string)
                 The  type  of  predefined worker that is allocated when a job
                 runs. Accepts a value of Standard, G.1X, G.2X, or G.025X.

                 o For the Standard worker type, each worker provides 4  vCPU,
                   16  GB  of  memory  and  a  50GB  disk, and 2 executors per
                   worker.

                 o For the G.1X worker type, each worker provides 4  vCPU,  16
                   GB of memory and a 64GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.

                 o For  the  G.2X worker type, each worker provides 8 vCPU, 32
                   GB of memory and a 128GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.

                 o For the G.025X worker type, each worker maps to 0.25 DPU (2
                   vCPU,  4 GB of memory, 64 GB disk), and provides 1 executor
                   per worker. We recommend this worker type  for  low  volume
                   streaming jobs. This worker type is only available for Glue
                   version 3.0 streaming jobs.

              NumberOfWorkers -> (integer)
                 The number of workers of a defined workerType that are  allo-
                 cated when a job runs.

              SecurityConfiguration -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the SecurityConfiguration structure to be used
                 with this job run.

              LogGroupName -> (string)
                 The name of the log group for  secure  logging  that  can  be
                 server-side  encrypted  in  Amazon CloudWatch using KMS. This
                 name can be /aws-glue/jobs/ , in which case the  default  en-
                 cryption is NONE . If you add a role name and SecurityConfig-
                 uration  name  (in  other   words,   /aws-glue/jobs-yourRole-
                 Name-yourSecurityConfigurationName/  ),  then  that  security
                 configuration is used to encrypt the log group.

              NotificationProperty -> (structure)
                 Specifies configuration properties of a job run notification.

                 NotifyDelayAfter -> (integer)
                     After a job run starts, the number of minutes to wait be-
                     fore sending a job run delay notification.

              GlueVersion -> (string)
                 Glue  version  determines  the  versions  of Apache Spark and
                 Python that Glue supports. The Python version  indicates  the
                 version supported for jobs of type Spark.

                 For  more  information  about the available Glue versions and
                 corresponding Spark and Python versions, see Glue version  in
                 the developer guide.

                 Jobs  that  are created without specifying a Glue version de-
                 fault to Glue 0.9.

              DPUSeconds -> (double)
                 This field populates only when an Auto Scaling job  run  com-
                 pletes,  and represents the total time each executor ran dur-
                 ing the lifecycle of a job run in seconds,  multiplied  by  a
                 DPU  factor  (1  for G.1X and 2 for G.2X workers). This value
                 may be different than the executionEngineRuntime *  MaxCapac-
                 ity as in the case of Auto Scaling jobs, as the number of ex-
                 ecutors running at a given time may be less than  the  MaxCa-
                 pacity  . Therefore, it is possible that the value of DPUSec-
                 onds is less than executionEngineRuntime * MaxCapacity .
