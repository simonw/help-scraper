GET-PARTITIONS()                                              GET-PARTITIONS()



NAME
       get-partitions -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about the partitions in a table.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-partitions  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Partitions

SYNOPSIS
            get-partitions
          [--catalog-id <value>]
          --database-name <value>
          --table-name <value>
          [--expression <value>]
          [--segment <value>]
          [--exclude-column-schema | --no-exclude-column-schema]
          [--transaction-id <value>]
          [--query-as-of-time <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The ID of the Data Catalog where the partitions in question  reside.
          If  none  is provided, the Amazon Web Services account ID is used by
          default.

       --database-name (string)
          The name of the catalog database where the partitions reside.

       --table-name (string)
          The name of the partitions' table.

       --expression (string)
          An expression that filters the partitions to be returned.

          The expression uses SQL syntax  similar  to  the  SQL  WHERE  filter
          clause. The SQL statement parser JSQLParser parses the expression.
              Operators  : The following are the operators that you can use in
              the Expression API call:
                 =

          Checks whether the values of the two operands  are  equal;  if  yes,
          then the condition becomes true.

          Example: Assume 'variable a' holds 10 and 'variable b' holds 20.

          (a = b) is not true.
              < >

          Checks  whether  the values of two operands are equal; if the values
          are not equal, then the condition becomes true.

          Example: (a < > b) is true.
              >

          Checks whether the value of the left operand  is  greater  than  the
          value of the right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.

          Example: (a > b) is not true.
              <

          Checks  whether the value of the left operand is less than the value
          of the right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.

          Example: (a < b) is true.
              >=

          Checks whether the value of the left  operand  is  greater  than  or
          equal  to the value of the right operand; if yes, then the condition
          becomes true.

          Example: (a >= b) is not true.
              <=

          Checks whether the value of the left operand is less than  or  equal
          to  the  value  of the right operand; if yes, then the condition be-
          comes true.

          Example: (a <= b) is true.
              AND, OR, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, NOT, IS NULL

          Logical operators.
              Supported Partition Key Types : The following are the  supported
              partition keys.

          o string

          o date

          o timestamp

          o int

          o bigint

          o long

          o tinyint

          o smallint

          o decimal

          If an type is encountered that is not valid, an exception is thrown.

          The  following list shows the valid operators on each type. When you
          define a crawler, the partitionKey type is created as a STRING ,  to
          be compatible with the catalog partitions.
              Sample API Call :

       --segment (structure)
          The segment of the table's partitions to scan in this request.

          SegmentNumber -> (integer)
              The  zero-based index number of the segment. For example, if the
              total number of segments is 4, SegmentNumber values range from 0
              through 3.

          TotalSegments -> (integer)
              The total number of segments.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SegmentNumber=integer,TotalSegments=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SegmentNumber": integer,
            "TotalSegments": integer
          }

       --exclude-column-schema | --no-exclude-column-schema (boolean)
          When true, specifies not returning the partition column schema. Use-
          ful when you are interested only in other partition attributes  such
          as partition values or location. This approach avoids the problem of
          a large response by not returning duplicate data.

       --transaction-id (string)
          The transaction ID at which to read the partition contents.

       --query-as-of-time (timestamp)
          The time as of when to read the partition contents. If not set,  the
          most  recent  transaction commit time will be used. Cannot be speci-
          fied along with TransactionId .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
