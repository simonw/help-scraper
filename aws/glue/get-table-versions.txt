GET-TABLE-VERSIONS()                                      GET-TABLE-VERSIONS()



NAME
       get-table-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a list of strings that identify available versions of a spec-
       ified table.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-table-versions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: TableVersions

SYNOPSIS
            get-table-versions
          [--catalog-id <value>]
          --database-name <value>
          --table-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The  ID of the Data Catalog where the tables reside. If none is pro-
          vided, the Amazon Web Services account ID is used by default.

       --database-name (string)
          The database in the catalog in which the  table  resides.  For  Hive
          compatibility, this name is entirely lowercase.

       --table-name (string)
          The name of the table. For Hive compatibility, this name is entirely
          lowercase.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                        Schema Registry.

                        When creating a table, you can pass an empty  list  of
                        columns  for the schema, and instead use a schema ref-

                     A list of columns by which the table is partitioned. Only
                     primitive types are supported as partition keys.

                     When you create a table used by Amazon Athena, and you do
                     not specify any partitionKeys , you must at least set the
                     value of partitionKeys to an empty list. For example:
                        "PartitionKeys": []

              VersionId -> (string)
                 The ID value that identifies this table version. A  VersionId
                 is a string representation of an integer. Each version is in-

       NextToken -> (string)
