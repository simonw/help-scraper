NAME
       get-table -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the Table definition in a Data Catalog for a specified table.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-table
          [--catalog-id <value>]
          --database-name <value>
          --name <value>
          [--transaction-id <value>]
          [--query-as-of-time <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The  ID of the Data Catalog where the table resides. If none is pro-
          vided, the Amazon Web Services account ID is used by default.

       --database-name (string)
          The name of the database in the catalog in which the table  resides.
          For Hive compatibility, this name is entirely lowercase.

       --name (string)
          The name of the table for which to retrieve the definition. For Hive
          compatibility, this name is entirely lowercase.

       --transaction-id (string)
          The transaction ID at which to read the table contents.

       --query-as-of-time (timestamp)
          The time as of when to read the table contents. If not set, the most
          recent  transaction  commit  time  will be used. Cannot be specified
          along with TransactionId .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
