GET-USER-DEFINED-FUNCTIONS()                      GET-USER-DEFINED-FUNCTIONS()



NAME
       get-user-defined-functions -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves multiple function definitions from the Data Catalog.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-user-defined-functions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: UserDefinedFunctions

SYNOPSIS
            get-user-defined-functions
          [--catalog-id <value>]
          [--database-name <value>]
          --pattern <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The ID of the Data Catalog where the functions to be  retrieved  are
          located.  If none is provided, the Amazon Web Services account ID is
          used by default.

       --database-name (string)
          The name of the catalog database where the functions are located. If
          none  is provided, functions from all the databases across the cata-
          log will be returned.

       --pattern (string)
          An optional function-name pattern string that filters  the  function
          definitions returned.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       UserDefinedFunctions -> (list)
          A list of requested function definitions.

          (structure)
              Represents the equivalent of a Hive user-defined function (UDF )
              definition.

              FunctionName -> (string)
                 The name of the function.

              DatabaseName -> (string)
                 The name of the catalog database that contains the function.

              ClassName -> (string)
                 The Java class that contains the function code.

              OwnerName -> (string)
                 The owner of the function.

              OwnerType -> (string)
                 The owner type.

              CreateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the function was created.

              ResourceUris -> (list)
                 The resource URIs for the function.

                 (structure)
                     The URIs for function resources.

                     ResourceType -> (string)
                        The type of the resource.

                     Uri -> (string)
                        The URI for accessing the resource.

              CatalogId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Data Catalog in which the function resides.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A continuation token, if the list of functions returned does not in-
          clude the last requested function.
