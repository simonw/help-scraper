GET-ML-TRANSFORMS()                                        GET-ML-TRANSFORMS()



NAME
       get-ml-transforms -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  sortable,  filterable  list  of existing Glue machine learning
       transforms. Machine learning transforms are a special type of transform
       that use machine learning to learn the details of the transformation to
       be performed by learning from examples provided by humans. These trans-
       formations  are then saved by Glue, and you can retrieve their metadata
       by calling GetMLTransforms .

          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

                        Additional options for the table. Currently there  are
                        two keys supported:

                        o pushDownPredicate  : to filter on partitions without
                          having to list  and  read  all  the  files  in  your
                          dataset.

                        o catalogPartitionPredicate  : to use server-side par-
                          tition pruning using partition indexes in  the  Glue
                          Data Catalog.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (string)

              Parameters -> (structure)
                 A  TransformParameters object. You can use parameters to tune
                 (customize) the behavior of the machine learning transform by
                 specifying  what  data  it learns from and your preference on
                 various tradeoffs (such as precious vs. recall,  or  accuracy
                 vs. cost).

                 TransformType -> (string)
                     The type of machine learning transform.

                     For  information  about  the  types  of  machine learning
                     transforms, see Creating Machine Learning Transforms .

                 FindMatchesParameters -> (structure)
                     The parameters for the find matches algorithm.

                     PrimaryKeyColumnName -> (string)
                        The name of a column that uniquely identifies rows  in
                        the  source  table.  Used  to  help  identify matching
                        records.

                     PrecisionRecallTradeoff -> (double)
                        The value selected when tuning your  transform  for  a
                        balance  between  precision and recall. A value of 0.5
                        means no preference; a  value  of  1.0  means  a  bias
                        purely  for precision, and a value of 0.0 means a bias
                        for recall. Because this is a tradeoff, choosing  val-
                        ues  close  to 1.0 means very low recall, and choosing
                        values close to 0.0 results in very low precision.

                        The precision metric indicates how often your model is
                        correct when it predicts a match.

                        The  recall metric indicates that for an actual match,
                        how often your model predicts the match.

                     AccuracyCostTradeoff -> (double)
                        The value that is selected when tuning your  transform
                        for  a  balance  between accuracy and cost. A value of
                        0.5 means that the system balances accuracy  and  cost
                        concerns. A value of 1.0 means a bias purely for accu-
                        racy, which typically results in a higher cost,  some-
                        times  substantially  higher.  A  value of 0.0 means a
                        bias purely for cost, which results in a less accurate
                        FindMatches transform, sometimes with unacceptable ac-
                        curacy.

                        Accuracy measures how well the  transform  finds  true
                        positives  and true negatives. Increasing accuracy re-
                        quires more machine resources and cost.  But  it  also
                        results in increased recall.

                        Cost  measures  how  many  compute resources, and thus
                        money, are consumed to run the transform.

                     EnforceProvidedLabels -> (boolean)
                        The value to switch on or off to force the  output  to
                        match  the provided labels from users. If the value is
                        True , the find matches transform forces the output to
                        match  the  provided  labels. The results override the
                        normal conflation results. If the value is False , the
                        find  matches transform does not ensure all the labels
                        provided are respected, and the results  rely  on  the
                        trained model.

                        Note  that setting this value to true may increase the
                        conflation execution time.

              EvaluationMetrics -> (structure)
                 An EvaluationMetrics object. Evaluation  metrics  provide  an
                 estimate of the quality of your machine learning transform.

                 TransformType -> (string)
                     The type of machine learning transform.

                 FindMatchesMetrics -> (structure)
                     The evaluation metrics for the find matches algorithm.

                     AreaUnderPRCurve -> (double)
                        The area under the precision/recall curve (AUPRC) is a
                        single number measuring the  overall  quality  of  the
                        transform,  that is independent of the choice made for
                        precision vs. recall. Higher values indicate that  you
                        have a more attractive precision vs. recall tradeoff.

                        For  more  information,  see  Precision  and recall in
                        Wikipedia.

                     Precision -> (double)
                        The precision metric indicates when often your  trans-
                        form  is  correct  when  it predicts a match. Specifi-
                        cally, it measures how well the transform  finds  true
                        positives from the total true positives possible.

                        For  more  information,  see  Precision  and recall in
                        Wikipedia.

                     Recall -> (double)
                        The recall metric indicates that for an actual  match,
                        how  often your transform predicts the match. Specifi-
                        cally, it measures how well the transform  finds  true
                        positives from the total records in the source data.

                        For  more  information,  see  Precision  and recall in
                        Wikipedia.

                     F1 -> (double)
                        The maximum F1 metric indicates the transform's  accu-
                        racy between 0 and 1, where 1 is the best accuracy.

                        For more information, see F1 score in Wikipedia.

                     ConfusionMatrix -> (structure)
                        The  confusion matrix shows you what your transform is
                        predicting accurately and what types of errors  it  is
                        making.

                        For   more   information,   see  Confusion  matrix  in
                        Wikipedia.

                        NumTruePositives -> (long)
                            The number of matches in the data that the  trans-
                            form  correctly found, in the confusion matrix for
                            your transform.

                        NumFalsePositives -> (long)
                            The number of nonmatches  in  the  data  that  the
                            transform  incorrectly  classified  as a match, in
                            the confusion matrix for your transform.

                        NumTrueNegatives -> (long)

                            transform correctly rejected, in the confusion ma-
                            trix for your transform.

                        NumFalseNegatives -> (long)
                            The number of matches in the data that the  trans-
                            form didn't find, in the confusion matrix for your
                            transform.

                     ColumnImportances -> (list)
                        A list of ColumnImportance structures containing  col-
                        umn  importance metrics, sorted in order of descending
                        importance.

                        (structure)
                            A structure containing the column name and  column
                            importance score for a column.

                            Column importance helps you understand how columns
                            contribute to your  model,  by  identifying  which
                            columns  in  your  records are more important than
                            others.

                            ColumnName -> (string)
                               The name of a column.

                            Importance -> (double)
                               The column importance score for the column,  as
                               a decimal.

              LabelCount -> (integer)
                 A  count  identifier for the labeling files generated by Glue
                 for this transform. As you create a better transform, you can
                 iteratively download, label, and upload the labeling file.

              Schema -> (list)
                 A  map  of  key-value pairs representing the columns and data
                 types that this transform can run against. Has an upper bound
                 of 100 columns.

                 (structure)
                     A key-value pair representing a column and data type that
                     this transform can run against. The Schema  parameter  of
                     the  MLTransform  may  contain  up to 100 of these struc-
                     tures.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the column.

                     DataType -> (string)
                        The type of data in the column.

              Role -> (string)
                 The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM  role  with
                 the  required  permissions.  The required permissions include
                 both Glue service role permissions  to  Glue  resources,  and
                 Amazon S3 permissions required by the transform.

                 o This  role needs Glue service role permissions to allow ac-
                   cess to resources in Glue. See Attach a Policy to IAM Users
                   That Access Glue .

                 o This  role  needs  permission to your Amazon Simple Storage
                   Service (Amazon S3) sources, targets, temporary  directory,
                   scripts,  and  any  libraries used by the task run for this
                   transform.

              GlueVersion -> (string)
                 This value determines which  version  of  Glue  this  machine
                 learning  transform  is  compatible  with. Glue 1.0 is recom-
                 mended for most customers. If the value is not set, the  Glue
                 compatibility defaults to Glue 0.9. For more information, see
                 Glue Versions in the developer guide.

              MaxCapacity -> (double)
                 The number of Glue data processing units (DPUs) that are  al-
                 located  to  task  runs  for this transform. You can allocate
                 from 2 to 100 DPUs; the default is 10. A DPU  is  a  relative
                 measure  of processing power that consists of 4 vCPUs of com-
                 pute capacity and 16 GB of memory. For more information,  see
                 the Glue pricing page .
                     MaxCapacity is a mutually exclusive option with NumberOf-
                     Workers and WorkerType .

                 o If either NumberOfWorkers or WorkerType is set, then MaxCa-
                   pacity cannot be set.

                 o If MaxCapacity is set then neither NumberOfWorkers or Work-
                   erType can be set.

                 o If WorkerType is set, then NumberOfWorkers is required (and
                   vice versa).

                 o MaxCapacity and NumberOfWorkers must both be at least 1.

                 When  the WorkerType field is set to a value other than Stan-
                 dard , the MaxCapacity field is set automatically and becomes
                 read-only.

              WorkerType -> (string)
                 The  type  of predefined worker that is allocated when a task
                 of this transform runs. Accepts a value of Standard, G.1X, or
                 G.2X.

                 o For  the Standard worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU,
                   16 GB of memory and  a  50GB  disk,  and  2  executors  per
                   worker.

                 o For  the  G.1X worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16
                   GB of memory and a 64GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.

                 o For the G.2X worker type, each worker provides 8  vCPU,  32
                   GB of memory and a 128GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.
                     MaxCapacity is a mutually exclusive option with NumberOf-
                     Workers and WorkerType .

                 o If either NumberOfWorkers or WorkerType is set, then MaxCa-
                   pacity cannot be set.

                 o If MaxCapacity is set then neither NumberOfWorkers or Work-
                   erType can be set.

                 o If WorkerType is set, then NumberOfWorkers is required (and
                   vice versa).

                 o MaxCapacity and NumberOfWorkers must both be at least 1.

              NumberOfWorkers -> (integer)
                 The  number of workers of a defined workerType that are allo-
                 cated when a task of the transform runs.

                 If WorkerType is set, then NumberOfWorkers is  required  (and
                 vice versa).

              Timeout -> (integer)
                 The timeout in minutes of the machine learning transform.

              MaxRetries -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  number  of times to retry after an MLTaskRun of
                 the machine learning transform fails.

              TransformEncryption -> (structure)
                 The encryption-at-rest settings of the transform  that  apply
                 to  accessing  user data. Machine learning transforms can ac-
                 cess user data encrypted in Amazon S3 using KMS.

                 MlUserDataEncryption -> (structure)
                     An MLUserDataEncryption object containing the  encryption
                     mode and customer-provided KMS key ID.

                     MlUserDataEncryptionMode -> (string)
                        The encryption mode applied to user data. Valid values
                        are:

                        o DISABLED: encryption is disabled

                        o SSEKMS: use of server-side encryption with Key  Man-
                          agement  Service  (SSE-KMS)  for user data stored in
                          Amazon S3.

                     KmsKeyId -> (string)
