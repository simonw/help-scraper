OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the trigger.

       --workflow-name (string)
          The name of the workflow associated with the trigger.

       --type (string)
          The type of the new trigger.

          Possible values:

          o SCHEDULED

          o CONDITIONAL

          o ON_DEMAND

          o EVENT

       --schedule (string)
          A  cron  expression  used  to  specify  the schedule (see Time-Based
          Schedules for Jobs and Crawlers . For example, to run something  ev-
          ery day at 12:15 UTC, you would specify: cron(15 12 * * ? *) .

          This field is required when the trigger type is SCHEDULED.

       --predicate (structure)
          A predicate to specify when the new trigger should fire.

          This field is required when the trigger type is CONDITIONAL .

          Logical -> (string)
              An  optional  field if only one condition is listed. If multiple
              conditions are listed, then this field is required.

          Conditions -> (list)
              A list of the conditions that determine when  the  trigger  will
              fire.

              (structure)
                 Defines a condition under which a trigger fires.

                 LogicalOperator -> (string)
                     A logical operator.

                 JobName -> (string)
                     The  name of the job whose JobRuns this condition applies
                     to, and on which this trigger waits.

                 State -> (string)
                     The condition state. Currently, the only job states  that
                     a trigger can listen for are SUCCEEDED , STOPPED , FAILED
                     , and TIMEOUT . The only crawler states  that  a  trigger
                     can listen for are SUCCEEDED , FAILED , and CANCELLED .

                 CrawlerName -> (string)
                     The name of the crawler to which this condition applies.

                 CrawlState -> (string)
                     The state of the crawler to which this condition applies.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Logical=string,Conditions=[{LogicalOperator=string,JobName=string,State=string,CrawlerName=string,CrawlState=string},{LogicalOperator=string,JobName=string,State=string,CrawlerName=string,CrawlState=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Logical": "AND"|"ANY",
            "Conditions": [
              {
                "LogicalOperator": "EQUALS",
                "JobName": "string",
                "State": "STARTING"|"RUNNING"|"STOPPING"|"STOPPED"|"SUCCEEDED"|"FAILED"|"TIMEOUT"|"ERROR"|"WAITING",
                "CrawlerName": "string",
                "CrawlState": "RUNNING"|"CANCELLING"|"CANCELLED"|"SUCCEEDED"|"FAILED"|"ERROR"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --actions (list)
          The actions initiated by this trigger when it fires.

          (structure)
              Defines an action to be initiated by a trigger.

              JobName -> (string)
                 The name of a job to be run.

              Arguments -> (map)
                 The  job arguments used when this trigger fires. For this job
                 run, they replace the default arguments set in the job  defi-
                 nition itself.

                 You  can  specify  arguments here that your own job-execution
                 script consumes, as well as arguments that Glue  itself  con-
                 sumes.

                 For information about how to specify and consume your own Job
                 arguments, see the Calling Glue APIs in Python topic  in  the
                 developer guide.

                 For  information about the key-value pairs that Glue consumes
                 to set up your job, see the Special Parameters Used  by  Glue
                 topic in the developer guide.

                 The  JobRun timeout in minutes. This is the maximum time that
                 a job run can consume resources before it is  terminated  and
                 enters  TIMEOUT  status.  The  default  is  2,880 minutes (48
                 hours). This overrides the timeout value set  in  the  parent
                 job.

              SecurityConfiguration -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the SecurityConfiguration structure to be used

                 Specifies configuration properties of a job run notification.

                 NotifyDelayAfter -> (integer)
                     After a job run starts, the number of minutes to wait be-
                     fore sending a job run delay notification.

              CrawlerName -> (string)
                 The name of the crawler to be used with this action.

            {
              "JobName": "string",
              "Arguments": {"string": "string"
                ...},
              "Timeout": integer,
              "SecurityConfiguration": "string",
              "NotificationProperty": {

          ated. True is not supported for ON_DEMAND triggers.

       --tags (map)
          The tags to use with this trigger. You may use tags to limit  access
          to  the trigger. For more information about tags in Glue, see Amazon

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --event-batching-condition (structure)
          Batch condition that must be met (specified  number  of  events  re-
          ceived  or batch time window expired) before EventBridge event trig-
          ger fires.

          BatchSize -> (integer)
              Number of events that must be received from  Amazon  EventBridge
              before EventBridge event trigger fires.

          BatchWindow -> (integer)
              Window  of time in seconds after which EventBridge event trigger
              fires. Window starts when first event is received.

          BatchSize=integer,BatchWindow=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {

          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Name -> (string)
          The name of the trigger.
