GET-CLASSIFIERS()                                            GET-CLASSIFIERS()



NAME
       get-classifiers -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all classifier objects in the Data Catalog.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-classifiers is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Classifiers

SYNOPSIS
            get-classifiers
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Classifiers -> (list)
          The requested list of classifier objects.

          (structure)
              Classifiers  are  triggered  during  a  crawl task. A classifier
              checks whether a given file is in a format it can handle. If  it
              is,  the classifier creates a schema in the form of a StructType
              object that matches that data format.

              You can use the standard classifiers that Glue provides, or  you
              can  write  your  own  classifiers  to best categorize your data
              sources and specify the appropriate schemas to use for  them.  A
              classifier  can  be a grok classifier, an XML classifier, a JSON
              classifier, or a custom CSV classifier, as specified in  one  of
              the fields in the Classifier object.

                 Classification -> (string)
                     An  identifier  of  the  data  format that the classifier
                     matches, such as Twitter, JSON, Omniture logs, and so on.

                 CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                     The time that this classifier was registered.

                     The version of this classifier.

                 GrokPattern -> (string)
                     The grok pattern applied to a data store by this  classi-
                     fier.  For  more  information,  see  built-in patterns in
                     Writing Custom Classifiers .

                 CustomPatterns -> (string)
                     Optional custom grok patterns defined by this classifier.

                     tom Classifiers .

              XMLClassifier -> (structure)
                 A classifier for XML content.

                 Name -> (string)

                 Classification -> (string)
                     An identifier of the  data  format  that  the  classifier
                     matches.

                 CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                     The time that this classifier was registered.

                 LastUpdated -> (timestamp)
                     The time that this classifier was last updated.

                     The  XML  tag  designating the element that contains each
                     record in an XML document being parsed. This can't  iden-
                     tify a self-closing element (closed by /> ). An empty row
                     element that contains only attributes can  be  parsed  as
                     long  as  it  ends  with a closing tag (for example, <row
                     item_a="A" item_b="B"></row> is okay, but <row item_a="A"
                     item_b="B" /> is not).

                 QuoteSymbol -> (string)
                     A custom symbol to denote what combines  content  into  a
                     single column value. It must be different from the column
                     delimiter.

                 ContainsHeader -> (string)
