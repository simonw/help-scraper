BATCH-DELETE-TABLE()                                      BATCH-DELETE-TABLE()



NAME
       batch-delete-table -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes multiple tables at once.

       NOTE:
          After  completing  this  operation, you no longer have access to the
          table versions and partitions that belong to the deleted table. Glue
          deletes  these  "orphaned" resources asynchronously in a timely man-
          ner, at the discretion of the service.

          To ensure the immediate deletion of all  related  resources,  before
          calling     BatchDeleteTable    ,    use    DeleteTableVersion    or
          BatchDeleteTableVersion , and DeletePartition  or  BatchDeleteParti-
          tion , to delete any resources that belong to the table.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-delete-table
          [--catalog-id <value>]
          --database-name <value>
          --tables-to-delete <value>
          [--transaction-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The  ID of the Data Catalog where the table resides. If none is pro-
          vided, the Amazon Web Services account ID is used by default.

       --database-name (string)
          The name of the catalog database in which the tables to  delete  re-
          side. For Hive compatibility, this name is entirely lowercase.

       --tables-to-delete (list)
          A list of the table to delete.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --transaction-id (string)
          The transaction ID at which to delete the table contents.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT

              TableName -> (string)
                 The name of the table. For Hive compatibility, this  must  be
                 entirely lowercase.

              ErrorDetail -> (structure)
                 The details about the error.

                 ErrorCode -> (string)
