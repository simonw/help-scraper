START-ML-LABELING-SET-GENERATION-TASTART-ML-LABELING-SET-GENERATION-TASK-RUN()



NAME
       start-ml-labeling-set-generation-task-run -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts the active learning workflow for your machine learning transform
       to improve the transform's quality by generating label sets and  adding
       labels.

       When  the  StartMLLabelingSetGenerationTaskRun finishes, Glue will have
       generated a "labeling set" or a set of questions for humans to answer.

       In the case of the FindMatches transform, these questions  are  of  the
       form,  What is the correct way to group these rows together into groups
       composed entirely of matching records?

       After the labeling process is finished, you can upload your labels with
       a  call  to  StartImportLabelsTaskRun  . After StartImportLabelsTaskRun
       finishes, all future runs of the machine learning  transform  will  use
       the  new  and  improved labels and perform a higher-quality transforma-
       tion.

SYNOPSIS
            start-ml-labeling-set-generation-task-run
          --transform-id <value>
          --output-s3-path <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --transform-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the machine learning transform.

       --output-s3-path (string)
          The Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) path where you  gener-
          ate the labeling set.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TaskRunId -> (string)
          The unique run identifier that is associated with this task run.
