LIST-SCHEMAS()                                                  LIST-SCHEMAS()



NAME
       list-schemas -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of  schemas with minimal details. Schemas in Deleting
       status will not be included in the results. Empty results will  be  re-
       turned if there are no schemas available.

       When  the RegistryId is not provided, all the schemas across registries
       will be part of the API response.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-schemas is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: Schemas

SYNOPSIS
            list-schemas
          [--registry-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (structure)
          A  wrapper  structure  that may contain the registry name and Amazon
          Resource Name (ARN).

          RegistryName -> (string)
              Name of the registry. Used only for lookup. One  of  RegistryArn
              or RegistryName has to be provided.

          RegistryArn -> (string)
              Arn  of  the  registry to be updated. One of RegistryArn or Reg-
              istryName has to be provided.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RegistryName=string,RegistryArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RegistryName": "string",
            "RegistryArn": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Schemas -> (list)

              Description -> (string)
                 A description for the schema.

              SchemaStatus -> (string)

              CreatedTime -> (string)
                 The date and time that a schema was created.

              UpdatedTime -> (string)
                 The date and time that a schema was updated.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A continuation token for paginating the returned list of tokens, re-
          turned if the current segment of the list is not the last.
