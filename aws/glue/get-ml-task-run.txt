GET-ML-TASK-RUN()                                            GET-ML-TASK-RUN()



NAME
       get-ml-task-run -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  details  for a specific task run on a machine learning transform.
       Machine learning task runs are asynchronous tasks  that  Glue  runs  on
       your  behalf  as  part  of  various machine learning workflows. You can
       check the stats of any  task  run  by  calling  GetMLTaskRun  with  the
       TaskRunID and its parent transform's TransformID .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-ml-task-run
          --transform-id <value>
          --task-run-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --transform-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the machine learning transform.

       --task-run-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the task run.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
