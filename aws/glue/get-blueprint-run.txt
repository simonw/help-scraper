NAME
       get-blueprint-run -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the details of a blueprint run.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-blueprint-run
          --blueprint-name <value>
          --run-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --blueprint-name (string)
          The name of the blueprint.

       --run-id (string)
          The run ID for the blueprint run you want to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       BlueprintRun -> (structure)
          Returns a BlueprintRun object.

          BlueprintName -> (string)
              The name of the blueprint.

          RunId -> (string)
              The run ID for this blueprint run.

          WorkflowName -> (string)
              The name of a workflow that is created as a result of a success-
              ful  blueprint  run. If a blueprint run has an error, there will
              not be a workflow created.

          State -> (string)
              The state of the blueprint run. Possible values are:

              o Running  The blueprint run is in progress.

              o Succeeded  The blueprint run completed successfully.

              o Failed  The blueprint run failed and rollback is complete.

              o Rolling Back  The blueprint run  failed  and  rollback  is  in
                progress.

          StartedOn -> (timestamp)

          RollbackErrorMessage -> (string)
              If  there  are any errors while creating the entities of a work-
              flow, we try to roll back the created entities until that  point

              trying to delete the entities that are created.

          Parameters -> (string)
              The blueprint parameters as a string. You will have to provide a
              value for each key that is required from the parameter spec that
              is defined in the Blueprint$ParameterSpec .

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The role ARN. This role will be assumed by the Glue service  and
