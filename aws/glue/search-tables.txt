SEARCH-TABLES()                                                SEARCH-TABLES()



NAME
       search-tables -

DESCRIPTION
       Searches  a  set of tables based on properties in the table metadata as
       well as on the parent database. You can search against text  or  filter
       conditions.

       You  can  only get tables that you have access to based on the security
       policies defined in Lake Formation. You need at least a  read-only  ac-
       cess  to  the table for it to be returned. If you do not have access to
       all the columns in the  table,  these  columns  will  not  be  searched
       against  when returning the list of tables back to you. If you have ac-
       cess to the columns but not the data in the columns, those columns  and
       the  associated  metadata  for  those  columns  will be included in the
       search.

SYNOPSIS
            search-tables
          [--catalog-id <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--search-text <value>]
          [--sort-criteria <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--resource-share-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          A unique identifier, consisting of `` account_id `` .

       --next-token (string)
          A continuation token, included if this is a continuation call.

       --filters (list)
          A list of key-value pairs, and  a  comparator  used  to  filter  the
          search results. Returns all entities matching the predicate.

          The  Comparator  member of the PropertyPredicate struct is used only
          for time fields, and can be omitted for  other  field  types.  Also,
          when  comparing string values, such as when Key=Name , a fuzzy match
          algorithm is used. The Key field (for example, the value of the Name
          field)  is  split on certain punctuation characters, for example, -,
          :, #, etc. into tokens. Then each token is exact-match compared with
          the Value member of PropertyPredicate . For example, if Key=Name and
          Value=link , tables named customer-link and xx-link-yy are returned,
          but xxlinkyy is not returned.

          (structure)
              Defines a property predicate.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the property.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the property.

              Comparator -> (string)
                 The comparator used to compare this property to others.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,Comparator=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "Comparator": "EQUALS"|"GREATER_THAN"|"LESS_THAN"|"GREATER_THAN_EQUALS"|"LESS_THAN_EQUALS"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --search-text (string)
          A string used for a text search.

          Specifying  a value in quotes filters based on an exact match to the
          value.

       --sort-criteria (list)
          A list of criteria for sorting the results by a field  name,  in  an
          ascending or descending order.

          (structure)
              Specifies a field to sort by and a sort order.

              FieldName -> (string)
                 The name of the field on which to sort.

              Sort -> (string)
                 An ascending or descending sort.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FieldName=string,Sort=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "FieldName": "string",
              "Sort": "ASC"|"DESC"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of tables to return in a single response.

       --resource-share-type (string)
          Allows you to specify that you want to search the tables shared with
          your account. The allowable values are FOREIGN or ALL .

          o If set to FOREIGN , will search the tables shared  with  your  ac-
            count.

          o If  set  to ALL , will search the tables shared with your account,
            as well as the tables in yor local account.

          Possible values:

          o FOREIGN

          o ALL

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
