OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The  name  of  the domain that you want to get availability for. The
          top-level domain (TLD), such as .com, must be a TLD  that  Route  53
          supports.  For  a  list  of supported TLDs, see Domains that You Can
          Register with Amazon Route 53 in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide
          .

          The domain name can contain only the following characters:

          o Letters a through z. Domain names are not case sensitive.

          o Numbers 0 through 9.

          o Hyphen  (-). You can't specify a hyphen at the beginning or end of
            a label.

          o Period (.) to separate the labels in the name, such as  the  .  in
            example.com .

          Internationalized  domain names are not supported for some top-level
          domains. To determine whether the TLD that you want to use  supports
          internationalized  domain  names,  see Domains that You Can Register
          with Amazon Route 53 . For more information, see Formatting Interna-
          tionalized Domain Names .

       --idn-lang-code (string)
          Reserved for future use.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To determine whether you can register a domain name with Route 53

       The following  check-domain-availability  command  returns  information
       about whether the domain name example.com is available to be registered
       using Route 53.

       This command runs only in the us-east-1 Region. If your default  region
       is set to us-east-1, you can omit the region parameter.

          aws route53domains check-domain-availability \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --domain-name example.com

       Output:

          {
              "Availability": "UNAVAILABLE"
          }

       Route  53  supports a large number of top-level domains (TLDs), such as
       .com and .jp, but we don't support all available TLDs. If you check the
       availability  of  a  domain  and  Route  53  doesn't  support  the TLD,
       check-domain-availability returns the following message.

          An error occurred (UnsupportedTLD) when calling the CheckDomainAvailability operation: <top-level domain> tld is not supported.

       For a list of the TLDs that you can use when registering a domain  with
       Route 53, see Domains That You Can Register with Amazon Route 53 in the
       Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.  For more information about  register-
       ing  domains  with Amazon Route 53, see Registering a New Domain in the
       Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       Availability -> (string)
          Whether the domain name is available for registering.

          NOTE:
              You can register only domains designated as AVAILABLE .

          Valid values:
              AVAILABLE

          The domain name is available.
              AVAILABLE_RESERVED

          The domain name is reserved under specific conditions.
              AVAILABLE_PREORDER

          The domain name is available and can be preordered.
              DONT_KNOW

          The TLD registry didn't reply with a definitive answer about whether
          the  domain name is available. Route 53 can return this response for
          a variety of reasons, for example, the registry is performing  main-
          tenance. Try again later.
              INVALID_NAME_FOR_TLD

          The  TLD  isn't  valid.  For example, it can contain characters that
          aren't allowed.
              PENDING

          The TLD registry didn't return a response in the expected amount  of
          time.  When the response is delayed, it usually takes just a few ex-
          tra seconds. You can resubmit the request immediately.
              RESERVED

          The domain name has been reserved for another  person  or  organiza-
          tion.
              UNAVAILABLE

          The domain name is not available.
              UNAVAILABLE_PREMIUM

          The domain name is not available.
              UNAVAILABLE_RESTRICTED

          The domain name is forbidden.
