TRANSFER-DOMAIN()                                            TRANSFER-DOMAIN()



NAME
       transfer-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       Transfers  a domain from another registrar to Amazon Route 53. When the
       transfer is complete, the domain is registered either with Amazon  Reg-
       istrar  (for  .com, .net, and .org domains) or with our registrar asso-
       ciate, Gandi (for all other TLDs).

       For more information about transferring domains, see the following top-
       ics:

       o For  transfer  requirements,  a  detailed  procedure, and information
         about viewing the status of a  domain  that  you're  transferring  to
         Route  53, see Transferring Registration for a Domain to Amazon Route
         53 in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

       o For information about how to transfer a domain from  one  Amazon  Web
         Services account to another, see TransferDomainToAnotherAwsAccount .

       o For information about how to transfer a domain to another domain reg-
         istrar, see Transferring a Domain from Amazon  Route  53  to  Another
         Registrar in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

       If  the  registrar for your domain is also the DNS service provider for
       the domain, we highly recommend that you transfer your DNS  service  to
       Route  53  or  to another DNS service provider before you transfer your
       registration. Some registrars provide free DNS service  when  you  pur-
       chase  a  domain  registration. When you transfer the registration, the
       previous registrar will not renew your domain  registration  and  could
       end your DNS service at any time.

       WARNING:
          If  the  registrar  for your domain is also the DNS service provider
          for the domain  and  you  don't  transfer  DNS  service  to  another
          provider,  your  website, email, and the web applications associated
          with the domain might become unavailable.

       If the transfer is successful, this method returns an operation ID that
       you  can use to track the progress and completion of the action. If the
       transfer doesn't complete successfully, the domain registrant  will  be
       notified by email.

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The  name  of  the domain that you want to transfer to Route 53. The
          top-level domain (TLD), such as .com, must be a TLD  that  Route  53
          supports.  For  a  list  of supported TLDs, see Domains that You Can

          .

            a label.

                 specify the IP address for ns.example.com.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
