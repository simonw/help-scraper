VIEW-BILLING()                                                  VIEW-BILLING()



NAME
       view-billing -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  all  the domain-related billing records for the current Amazon
       Web Services account for a specified period

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       view-billing is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: BillingRecords

SYNOPSIS
            view-billing
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The beginning date and time for the time period for which you want a
          list of billing records. Specify the date and time in Unix time for-
          mat and Coordinated Universal time (UTC).

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The  end date and time for the time period for which you want a list
          of billing records. Specify the date and time in  Unix  time  format
          and Coordinated Universal time (UTC).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get billing information for domain registration charges for the cur-
       rent AWS account

       The following  view-billing  command  returns  all  the  domain-related
       billing  records for the current account for the period from January 1,
       2018 (1514764800 in Unix  time)  and  midnight  on  December  31,  2019
       (1577836800 in Unix time).

       This  command runs only in the us-east-1 Region. If your default region
       is set to us-east-1, you can omit the region parameter.

          aws route53domains view-billing \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --start-time 1514764800 \
              --end-time 1577836800

       Output:

          {
              "BillingRecords": [
                  {
                      "DomainName": "example.com",
                      "Operation": "RENEW_DOMAIN",
                      "InvoiceId": "149962827",

                  },
                  {
                      "DomainName": "example.com",
                      "Operation": "RENEW_DOMAIN",
                      "InvoiceId": "290913289",

          }
