       fer       betweenAmazon      Web      Services      accounts      using
       TransferDomainToAnotherAwsAccount .

       Use either ListOperations or GetOperationDetail  to  determine  whether
       the  operation succeeded. GetOperationDetail provides additional infor-
       mation, for example, Domain Transfer from Aws Account 111122223333  has
       been cancelled .

SYNOPSIS
            reject-domain-transfer-from-another-aws-account
          --domain-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The  name  of  the domain that was specified when another Amazon Web
          Services account submitted a  TransferDomainToAnotherAwsAccount  re-
          quest.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       OperationId -> (string)
          The  identifier  that  TransferDomainToAnotherAwsAccount returned to
          track the progress of the request. Because the transfer request  was
          rejected,  the value is no longer valid, and you can't use GetOpera-
          tionDetail to query the operation status.
