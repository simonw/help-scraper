REGISTER-DOMAIN()                                            REGISTER-DOMAIN()



NAME
       register-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  registers  a  domain. Domains are registered either by
       Amazon Registrar (for .com, .net, and .org domains) or by our registrar
       associate,  Gandi  (for  all other domains). For some top-level domains
       (TLDs), this operation requires extra parameters.

       When you register a domain, Amazon Route 53 does the following:

       o Creates a Route 53 hosted zone that has the same name as the  domain.
         Route  53 assigns four name servers to your hosted zone and automati-
         cally updates your domain registration with the names of  these  name
         servers.

       o Enables  autorenew,  so your domain registration will renew automati-
         cally each year. We'll notify you in advance of the renewal  date  so
         you can choose whether to renew the registration.

       o Optionally  enables  privacy protection, so WHOIS queries return con-
         tact information either for Amazon Registrar  (for  .com,  .net,  and
         .org  domains)  or  for our registrar associate, Gandi (for all other
         TLDs). If you don't enable privacy protection, WHOIS  queries  return
         the  information that you entered for the administrative, registrant,
         and technical contacts.

       NOTE:
          You must specify the same privacy setting  for  the  administrative,
          registrant, and technical contacts.

       o If  registration  is successful, returns an operation ID that you can
         use to track the progress and completion of the action.  If  the  re-
         quest  is  not completed successfully, the domain registrant is noti-
         fied by email.

       o Charges your Amazon Web Services  account  an  amount  based  on  the
         top-level domain. For more information, see Amazon Route 53 Pricing .

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The  domain  name  that  you  want to register. The top-level domain
          (TLD), such as .com, must be a TLD that Route  53  supports.  For  a
          list  of supported TLDs, see Domains that You Can Register with Ama-
          zon Route 53 in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

          The domain name can contain only the following characters:

          o Letters a through z. Domain names are not case sensitive.

          o Numbers 0 through 9.

          o Hyphen (-). You can't specify a hyphen at the beginning or end  of
            a label.

          o Period  (.)  to  separate the labels in the name, such as the . in
            example.com .

          Internationalized domain names are not supported for some  top-level
          domains.  To determine whether the TLD that you want to use supports
          internationalized domain names, see Domains that  You  Can  Register
          with Amazon Route 53 . For more information, see Formatting Interna-
          tionalized Domain Names .

          your  domain, see Domains that You Can Register with Amazon Route 53
          in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To register a domain

       The  following  register-domain  command registers a domain, retrieving
       all parameter values from a JSON-formatted file.

       This command runs only in the us-east-1 Region. If your default  region
       is set to us-east-1, you can omit the region parameter.

          aws route53domains register-domain \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --cli-input-json file://register-domain.json
