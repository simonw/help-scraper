NAME
       retrieve-and-generate -

DESCRIPTION
       Queries a knowledge base and generates responses based on the retrieved
       results and using the specified foundation model or inference profile .
       The response only cites sources that are relevant to the query.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       retrieve-and-generate  uses document type values. Document types follow
       the JSON data model where valid values are: strings, numbers, booleans,
       null, arrays, and objects. For command input, options and nested param-
       eters that are labeled with the type document must be provided as JSON.
       Shorthand syntax does not support document types.

                            ther tokens. Do not use a minimum length of 1 or a
                            maximum length of 1000. The limit values described
                            here are arbitary values, for actual  values  con-
                            sult the limits defined by your specific model.

                            language model, influencing  how  much  the  model
                            sticks  to  the most predictable next words versus
                            exploring more surprising options. A lower temper-
                            ature  value (e.g. 0.2 or 0.3) makes model outputs
                            more deterministic or predictable, while a  higher
                            temperature  (e.g.  0.8  or 0.9) makes the outputs
                            more creative or unpredictable.

                            trols what the model considers for the set of pos-
                            sible next tokens. The model  will  only  consider
                            the  top  p%  of the probability distribution when
                            generating the next token.

                        The  template  for the prompt that's sent to the model
                        for response generation. You can include prompt place-
                        holders,  which  become  replaced before the prompt is
                        sent to the model to provide instructions and  context
                        to the model. In addition, you can include XML tags to

                     model. Orchestration prompts must include the  $conversa-
                     tion_history$ and $output_format_instructions$ variables.
                     For more information, see Use  placeholder  variables  in
                     the user guide.

                     textPromptTemplate -> (string)
                        The  template  for the prompt that's sent to the model
                        for response generation. You can include prompt place-
                        holders,  which  become  replaced before the prompt is
                        sent to the model to provide instructions and  context
                        to the model. In addition, you can include XML tags to
                        delineate meaningful sections of the prompt template.

       --session-configuration (structure)
          Contains details about the session with the knowledge base.

          kmsKeyArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the KMS key encrypting the session.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          kmsKeyArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "kmsKeyArn": "string"
          }

       --session-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the session. When you first make a  Retrie-
          veAndGenerate  request,  Amazon Bedrock automatically generates this
          value. You must reuse this value for all subsequent requests in  the
          same  conversational  session.  This  value allows Amazon Bedrock to
          maintain context and knowledge from previous interactions. You can't
          explicitly set the sessionId yourself.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This

          maintain context and knowledge from previous interactions. You can't
          explicitly set the sessionId yourself.
