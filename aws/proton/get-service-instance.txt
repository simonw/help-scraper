GET-SERVICE-INSTANCE()                                  GET-SERVICE-INSTANCE()



NAME
       get-service-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Get  detail  data  for a service instance. A service instance is an in-
       stantiation of service template and it runs in a specific environment.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-service-instance
          --name <value>
          --service-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of a service instance that you want to get the detail  data
          for.

       --service-name (string)
          The name of the service that the service instance belongs to.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get service instance details

       The following get-service-instance example gets detail data for a  ser-
       vice instance.

          aws proton get-service-instance \
              --name "instance-one" \
              --service-name "simple-svc"

       Output:
