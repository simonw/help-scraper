UPDATE-ENVIRONMENT()                                      UPDATE-ENVIRONMENT()



NAME
       update-environment -

DESCRIPTION
       Update an environment.

       If  the  environment  is associated with an environment account connec-
       tion, don't update or include the protonServiceRoleArn  and  provision-
       ingRepository  parameter to update or connect to an environment account
       connection.

       You can only update to a new environment account connection if  it  was
       created  in  the  same environment account that the current environment
       account connection was created in and is associated  with  the  current
       environment.

       If the environment isn't associated with an environment account connec-
       tion, don't update or include the environmentAccountConnectionId param-
       eter to update or connect to an environment account connection.

       You  can update either the environmentAccountConnectionId or protonSer-
       viceRoleArn parameter and value. You cant update both.

       If the environment was provisioned with pull request provisioning,  in-
       clude  the  provisioningRepository  parameter  and  omit the protonSer-
       viceRoleArn and environmentAccountConnectionId parameters.

       If the environment wasn't provisioned with pull  request  provisioning,
       omit the provisioningRepository parameter.

       There  are  four  modes for updating an environment as described in the
       following. The deploymentType field defines the mode.
          NONE

       In this mode, a deployment doesn't occur. Only the  requested  metadata
       parameters are updated.
          CURRENT_VERSION

       In this mode, the environment is deployed and updated with the new spec
       that you provide. Only requested parameters are updated.  Dont  include
       minor or major version parameters when you use this deployment-type .
          MINOR_VERSION

       In  this  mode,  the  environment is deployed and updated with the pub-
       lished, recommended (latest) minor version of the current major version
       in  use,  by default. You can also specify a different minor version of
       the current major version in use.
          MAJOR_VERSION

       In this mode, the environment is deployed and  updated  with  the  pub-
       lished,  recommended  (latest)  major  and minor version of the current
       template, by default. You can also specify a  different  major  version
       that's  higher  than  the major version in use and a minor version (op-
       tional).

       --description (string)
          A description of the environment update.

       --environment-account-connection-id (string)
          The ID of the environment account connection.

          You can only update to a new environment account  connection  if  it
          was  created  in the same environment account that the current envi-
          ronment account connection was created in and is associated with the
          current environment.

       --name (string)
          The name of the environment to update.

       --proton-service-role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Proton service role that al-
          lows Proton to make API calls to other services your behalf.

       --provisioning-repository (structure)
          The repository that you provide with pull request provisioning.

          WARNING:
              Provisioning by pull request is currently in feature preview and
              is  only  usable with Terraform based Proton Templates. To learn
              more about Amazon Web Services Feature Preview terms , see  sec-
              tion 2 on Beta and Previews.

          branch -> (string)
              The repository branch.

          name -> (string)
              The repository name.

          provider -> (string)
              The repository provider.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          branch=string,name=string,provider=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "branch": "string",
            "name": "string",
            "provider": "GITHUB"|"GITHUB_ENTERPRISE"|"BITBUCKET"
          }

       --spec (string)
          The formatted specification that defines the update.

       --template-major-version (string)
          The major version of the environment to update.

       --template-minor-version (string)
          The minor version of the environment to update.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
