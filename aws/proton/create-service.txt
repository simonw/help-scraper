OPTIONS
       --branch-name (string)
          The name of the code repository branch that holds  the  code  that's
          deployed  in  Proton.  Don't  include this parameter if your service
          template doesn't include a service pipeline.

       --description (string)
          A description of the Proton service.

       --name (string)
          The service name.

       --repository-connection-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  repository  connection.  For
          more information, see Set up repository connection in the Proton Ad-
          ministrator Guide and Setting up with  Proton  in  the  Proton  User
          Guide  .  Don't  include  this  parameter  if  your service template
          doesn't include a service pipeline.

       --repository-id (string)
          The ID of the code repository. Don't include this parameter if  your
          service template doesn't include a service pipeline.

       --spec (string)
          A link to a spec file that provides inputs as defined in the service
          template bundle schema file. The spec file is in YAML  format.  Dont
          include  pipeline inputs in the spec if your service template doesnt
          include a service pipeline. For more information, see Create a  ser-
          vice  in  the Proton Administrator Guide and Create a service in the
          Proton User Guide .

       --tags (list)
          An optional list of metadata items that you can associate  with  the
          Proton service. A tag is a key-value pair.

          For more information, see Proton resources and tagging in the Proton
          Administrator Guide or Proton User Guide .

          (structure)
              A description of a resource tag.

              key -> (string)
                 The key of the resource tag.

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --template-major-version (string)
          The major version of the service template that was  used  to  create
          the service.

       --template-minor-version (string)
          The  minor  version  of the service template that was used to create
          the service.

       --template-name (string)
          The name of the service template that's used to create the service.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a service

       The  following  create-service example creates a service with a service
       pipeline.

              --name "MySimpleService" \
              --template-name "fargate-service" \
              --template-major-version "1" \
              --branch-name "mainline" \
              --repository-connection-arn "arn:aws:codestar-connections:region-id:account-id:connection/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111" \
              --repository-id "myorg/myapp" \
              --spec file://spec.yaml

       Contents of spec.yaml:

          proton: ServiceSpec

          pipeline:
              my_sample_pipeline_required_input: "hello"
