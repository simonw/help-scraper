LIST-SERVICE-INSTANCES()                              LIST-SERVICE-INSTANCES()



NAME
       list-service-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       List service instances with summaries of detail data.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-service-instances is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: serviceInstances

SYNOPSIS
            list-service-instances
          [--service-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-name (string)
          The name of the service that the service instance belongs to.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To list all service instances

       The following list-service-instances example lists service instances.

          aws proton list-service-instances

       Output:

          {
              "serviceInstances": [
                  {
                      "arn": "arn:aws:proton:region-id:123456789012:service/simple-svc/service-instance/instance-one",
                      "createdAt": "2020-11-28T22:40:50.512000+00:00",
                      "deploymentStatus": "SUCCEEDED",
                      "environmentArn": "arn:aws:proton:region-id:123456789012:environment/simple-env",
                      "lastDeploymentAttemptedAt": "2020-11-28T22:40:50.512000+00:00",
                      "lastDeploymentSucceededAt": "2020-11-28T22:40:50.512000+00:00",

                      "templateName": "fargate-service"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Proton Administrator Guide or View service instance data in the The AWS
       Proton User Guide.

       Example 2: To list the specified service instance

       The following get-service-instance example gets a service instance.

          aws proton get-service-instance \
              --name "instance-one" \
              --service-name "simple-svc"

       Output:

          {
              "serviceInstance": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:proton:region-id:123456789012:service/simple-svc/service-instance/instance-one",
