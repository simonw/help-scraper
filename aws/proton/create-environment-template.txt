CREATE-ENVIRONMENT-TEMPLATE()                    CREATE-ENVIRONMENT-TEMPLATE()



NAME
       create-environment-template -

DESCRIPTION
       Create  an  environment  template for Proton. For more information, see
       Environment Templates in the Proton Administrator Guide .

       You can create an environment template in  one  of  the  two  following
       ways:

       o Register  and  publish a standard environment template that instructs
         Proton to deploy and manage environment infrastructure.

       o Register and publish a customer  managed  environment  template  that
         connects  Proton to your existing provisioned infrastructure that you
         manage. Proton doesn't manage your existing  provisioned  infrastruc-
         ture.  To create an environment template for customer provisioned and
         managed infrastructure, include the provisioning  parameter  and  set
         the  value  to  CUSTOMER_MANAGED . For more information, see Register
         and publish an environment template in the Proton Administrator Guide
         .

SYNOPSIS
            create-environment-template
          [--description <value>]
          [--display-name <value>]
          [--encryption-key <value>]
          --name <value>
          [--provisioning <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          A description of the environment template.

       --display-name (string)
          The  environment  template name as displayed in the developer inter-
          face.

       --encryption-key (string)
          A customer provided encryption key that Proton uses to encrypt data.

       --name (string)
          The name of the environment template.

       --provisioning (string)
          When included, indicates that the environment template is  for  cus-
          tomer provisioned and managed infrastructure.

          Possible values:

          o CUSTOMER_MANAGED

       --tags (list)
          Create tags for your environment template. For more information, see
          Proton resources and tagging in the Proton  Administrator  Guide  or
          Proton User Guide .

          (structure)
              A description of a resource tag.

              key -> (string)
                 The key of the resource tag.

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
