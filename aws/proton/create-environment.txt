CREATE-ENVIRONMENT()                                      CREATE-ENVIRONMENT()



NAME
       create-environment -

DESCRIPTION
       Deploy  a new environment. An Proton environment is created from an en-
       vironment template that defines infrastructure and resources  that  can
       be shared across services.
          You can provision environments using the following methods:

       o Standard  provisioning:  Proton  makes direct calls to provision your
         resources.

       o Pull request provisioning: Proton makes pull requests on your reposi-
         tory to provide compiled infrastructure as code (IaC) files that your
         IaC engine uses to provision resources.

       For more information, see the Environments in the Proton  Administrator
       Guide.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          A description of the environment that's being created and deployed.

       --environment-account-connection-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the  environment account connection that you provide if
          you're provisioning your environment infrastructure resources to  an
          environment account. You must include either the environmentAccount-
          ConnectionId or protonServiceRoleArn parameter and  value  and  omit
          the  provisioningRepository  parameter and values. For more informa-
          tion, see Environment account connections in the Proton  Administra-
          tor guide .

       --name (string)
          The name of the environment.

       --proton-service-role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Proton service role that al-
          lows Proton to make calls to other services on your behalf. You must
          include  either  the  environmentAccountConnectionId  or  protonSer-
          viceRoleArn parameter and value and omit the  provisioningRepository
          parameter when you use standard provisioning.

       --provisioning-repository (structure)
          The  repository  that you provide with pull request provisioning. If
          you provide this parameter, you must omit the environmentAccountCon-
          nectionId and protonServiceRoleArn parameters.

          WARNING:
              Provisioning by pull request is currently in feature preview and
              is only usable with Terraform based Proton Templates.  To  learn
              more  about Amazon Web Services Feature Preview terms , see sec-
              tion 2 on Beta and Previews.

          }

       --spec (string)
          A link to a YAML formatted spec file that provides inputs as defined
          in  the  environment  template bundle schema file. For more informa-
          tion, see Environments in the Proton Administrator Guide .

       --tags (list)
          Create tags for your environment. For more information,  see  Proton
          resources  and  tagging  in the Proton Administrator Guide or Proton
          User Guide .

          (structure)
              A description of a resource tag.

              key -> (string)
                 The key of the resource tag.

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --template-major-version (string)
          The major version of the environment template.

       --template-minor-version (string)
          The minor version of the environment template.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
