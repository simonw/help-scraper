DESCRIPTION
       Edit  a service description or use a spec to add and delete service in-
       stances.

       NOTE:
          Existing service instances and the service pipeline can't be  edited
          using this API. They can only be deleted.

       Use the description parameter to modify the description.

       Edit the spec parameter to add or delete instances.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-service
          [--description <value>]
          --name <value>
          [--spec <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          The edited service description.

       --name (string)
          The name of the service to edit.

       --spec (string)
          Lists  the  service  instances  to  add and the existing service in-
          stances to remain. Omit the existing  service  instances  to  delete
          from the list. Don't include edits to the existing service instances
          or pipeline. For more information, see Edit a service in the  Proton
          Administrator Guide or the Proton User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The following update-service example edits a service description.

          aws proton update-service \

              --description "Edit by updating description"

       Output:

          {
