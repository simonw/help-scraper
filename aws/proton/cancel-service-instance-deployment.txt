NAME
       cancel-service-instance-deployment -

DESCRIPTION
       Attempts  to cancel a service instance deployment on an  UpdateService-
       Instance action, if the deployment is IN_PROGRESS . For  more  informa-
       tion,  see  Update a service instance in the Proton Administrator guide
       or the Proton User guide .

       The following list includes potential cancellation scenarios.

       o If the cancellation attempt succeeds, the resulting deployment  state
         is CANCELLED .

       o If  the cancellation attempt fails, the resulting deployment state is
         FAILED .

       o If the current  UpdateServiceInstance action succeeds before the can-
         cellation attempt starts, the resulting deployment state is SUCCEEDED
         and the cancellation attempt has no effect.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            cancel-service-instance-deployment
          --service-instance-name <value>
          --service-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-instance-name (string)
          The name of the service instance with the deployment to cancel.

       --service-name (string)
          The name of the service with the service instance deployment to can-
          cel.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To cancel a service instance deployment

       The following cancel-service-instance-deployment example cancels a ser-
       vice instance deployment.

          aws proton cancel-service-instance-deployment \
              --service-instance-name "instance-one" \
              --service-name "simple-svc"

       Output:
