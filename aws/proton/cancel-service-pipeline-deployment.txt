NAME
       cancel-service-pipeline-deployment -

DESCRIPTION
       Attempts  to  cancel  a service pipeline deployment on an  UpdateServi-
       cePipeline action, if the deployment is IN_PROGRESS . For more informa-
       tion,  see  Update a service pipeline in the Proton Administrator guide
       or the Proton User guide .

       The following list includes potential cancellation scenarios.

       o If the cancellation attempt succeeds, the resulting deployment  state
         is CANCELLED .

       o If  the cancellation attempt fails, the resulting deployment state is
         FAILED .

       o If the current  UpdateServicePipeline action succeeds before the can-
         cellation attempt starts, the resulting deployment state is SUCCEEDED
         and the cancellation attempt has no effect.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            cancel-service-pipeline-deployment
          --service-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-name (string)
          The name of the service with the service pipeline deployment to can-
          cel.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
