OPTIONS
       --firewall-policy-name (string)
          The  descriptive  name  of the firewall policy. You can't change the
          name of a firewall policy after you create it.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --firewall-policy-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall policy.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       UpdateToken -> (string)
          A  token used for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a to-
          ken to your requests that access  the  firewall  policy.  The  token
          marks the state of the policy resource at the time of the request.

          To  make  changes  to  the policy, you provide the token in your re-
          quest. Network Firewall uses the token to  ensure  that  the  policy
          hasn't  changed  since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the
          operation fails with an InvalidTokenException . If this happens, re-
          trieve  the  firewall  policy again to get a current copy of it with
          current token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try  the  opera-
          tion again using the new token.

       FirewallPolicyResponse -> (structure)
          The high-level properties of a firewall policy. This, along with the
          FirewallPolicy , define the policy. You can retrieve all objects for
          a firewall policy by calling  DescribeFirewallPolicy .

          FirewallPolicyName -> (string)
              The  descriptive  name  of the firewall policy. You can't change
              the name of a firewall policy after you create it.

          FirewallPolicyArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall policy.

              NOTE:
                 If this response is for a create request that had DryRun  set
                 to  TRUE , then this ARN is a placeholder that isn't attached
                 to a valid resource.

          FirewallPolicyId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the firewall policy.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the firewall policy.

          FirewallPolicyStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the firewall policy. You can retrieve this
              for  a  firewall  policy  by calling  DescribeFirewallPolicy and
              providing the firewall policy's name or ARN.

          Tags -> (list)
              The key:value pairs to associate with the resource.

              (structure)
                 A key:value pair associated with an Amazon Web  Services  re-
                 source.  The key:value pair can be anything you define. Typi-
                 cally, the tag key represents a category (such  as  "environ-
                 ment")  and  the tag value represents a specific value within
                 that category (such as  "test,"  "development,"  or  "produc-
                 tion"). You can add up to 50 tags to each Amazon Web Services
                 resource.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The part of the key:value pair that defines  a  tag.  You
                     can  use a tag key to describe a category of information,
                     such as "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The part of the key:value pair that defines  a  tag.  You
                     can use a tag value to describe a specific value within a
                     category, such as "companyA" or  "companyB."  Tag  values
                     are case-sensitive.

          ConsumedStatelessRuleCapacity -> (integer)
              The  number of capacity units currently consumed by the policy's
              stateless rules.

          ConsumedStatefulRuleCapacity -> (integer)
              The number of capacity units currently consumed by the  policy's
              stateful rules.

          NumberOfAssociations -> (integer)
              The  number  of firewalls that are associated with this firewall
              policy.

          EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
              A complex type that contains the Amazon Web Services KMS encryp-
              tion configuration settings for your firewall policy.

              KeyId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of  the  Amazon  Web Services Key Management Service
                 (KMS) customer managed key. You can use any of the key  iden-
                 tifiers  that  KMS supports, unless you're using a key that's
                 managed by another account. If you're using a key managed  by
                 another  account, then specify the key ARN. For more informa-
                 tion, see Key ID in the Amazon  Web  Services  KMS  Developer
                 Guide .

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of Amazon Web Services KMS key to use for encryption
                 of your Network Firewall resources.

          LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
              The last time that the firewall policy was changed.

       FirewallPolicy -> (structure)
          The policy for the specified firewall policy.

          StatelessRuleGroupReferences -> (list)
              References to the stateless rule groups that  are  used  in  the
              policy. These define the matching criteria in stateless rules.

              (structure)
                 Identifier for a single stateless rule group, used in a fire-
                 wall policy to refer to the rule group.

                 ResourceArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the  stateless  rule
                     group.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     An  integer  setting that indicates the order in which to
                     run the stateless rule groups in a single  FirewallPolicy
                     . Network Firewall applies each stateless rule group to a
                     packet starting with the group that has the lowest prior-
                     ity  setting.  You must ensure that the priority settings
                     are unique within each policy.

          StatelessDefaultActions -> (list)
              The actions to take on a packet if it doesn't match any  of  the
              stateless  rules in the policy. If you want non-matching packets
              to  be  forwarded  for  stateful  inspection,  specify  aws:for-
              ward_to_sfe .

              You  must  specify  one  of  the  standard  actions:  aws:pass ,
              aws:drop , or aws:forward_to_sfe . In addition, you can  specify
              custom  actions  that  are compatible with your standard section
              choice.

              For example, you could specify ["aws:pass"] or you could specify
              ["aws:pass",  customActionName] . For information about compati-
              bility, see the custom action descriptions under  CustomAction .

              (string)

          StatelessFragmentDefaultActions -> (list)
              The actions to take on a fragmented UDP  packet  if  it  doesn't
              match any of the stateless rules in the policy. Network Firewall
              only manages UDP packet  fragments  and  silently  drops  packet
              fragments  for  other  protocols. If you want non-matching frag-
              mented UDP packets to  be  forwarded  for  stateful  inspection,
              specify aws:forward_to_sfe .

              You  must  specify  one  of  the  standard  actions:  aws:pass ,
              aws:drop , or aws:forward_to_sfe . In addition, you can  specify
              custom  actions  that  are compatible with your standard section
              choice.

              For example, you could specify ["aws:pass"] or you could specify
              ["aws:pass",  customActionName] . For information about compati-
              bility, see the custom action descriptions under  CustomAction .

              (string)

          StatelessCustomActions -> (list)
              The custom action definitions that are available for use in  the
              firewall policy's StatelessDefaultActions setting. You name each
              custom action that you define, and then you can use it  by  name
              in your default actions specifications.

              (structure)
                 An  optional, non-standard action to use for stateless packet
                 handling. You can define this in addition to the standard ac-
                 tion that you must specify.

                 You  define  and  name the custom actions that you want to be
                 able to use, and then you reference them by name in your  ac-
                 tions settings.

                 You can use custom actions in the following places:

                 o In  a rule group's  StatelessRulesAndCustomActions specifi-
                   cation. The custom actions are available for  use  by  name
                   inside  the StatelessRulesAndCustomActions where you define
                   them. You can use them for your stateless rule  actions  to
                   specify  what  to  do with a packet that matches the rule's
                   match attributes.

                 o In a  FirewallPolicy specification,  in  StatelessCustomAc-
                   tions . The custom actions are available for use inside the
                   policy where you define them. You can use them for the pol-
                   icy's default stateless actions settings to specify what to
                   do with packets that don't match any of the policy's state-
                   less rules.

                 ActionName -> (string)
                     The  descriptive  name  of  the  custom action. You can't
                     change the name of a custom action after you create it.

                 ActionDefinition -> (structure)
                     The custom action associated with the action name.

                     PublishMetricAction -> (structure)
                        Stateless inspection criteria that publishes the spec-
                        ified  metrics  to  Amazon CloudWatch for the matching
                        packet. This setting defines  a  CloudWatch  dimension
                        value to be published.

                        You  can pair this custom action with any of the stan-
                        dard stateless rule actions. For  example,  you  could
                        pair  this  in  a rule action with the standard action
                        that forwards  the  packet  for  stateful  inspection.
                        Then, when a packet matches the rule, Network Firewall
                        publishes metrics for the packet and forwards it.

                        Dimensions -> (list)
                            (structure)
                               The value to use in an Amazon CloudWatch custom
                               metric  dimension. This is used in the Publish-
                               Metrics   CustomAction .  A  CloudWatch  custom
                               metric  dimension  is  a name/value pair that's
                               part of the identity of a metric.

                               Network Firewall sets  the  dimension  name  to
                               CustomAction  and  you  provide  the  dimension
                               value.

                               For more information  about  CloudWatch  custom
                               metric  dimensions,  see Publishing Custom Met-
                               rics in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide .

                               Value -> (string)
                                   The value to use in the custom  metric  di-
                                   mension.

          StatefulRuleGroupReferences -> (list)
              References to the stateful rule groups that are used in the pol-
              icy. These define the inspection criteria in stateful rules.

              (structure)
                 Identifier for a single stateful rule group, used in a  fire-
                 wall policy to refer to a rule group.

                 ResourceArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the stateful rule
                     group.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     An integer setting that indicates the order in  which  to
                     run  the stateful rule groups in a single  FirewallPolicy
                     . This setting only applies  to  firewall  policies  that
                     specify  the  STRICT_ORDER rule order in the stateful en-
                     gine options settings.

                     Network  Firewall  evalutes  each  stateful  rule   group
                     against  a  packet  starting  with the group that has the
                     lowest priority setting. You must ensure that the  prior-
                     ity settings are unique within each policy.

                     You  can change the priority settings of your rule groups
                     at any time. To make it  easier  to  insert  rule  groups
                     later,  number  them  so there's a wide range in between,
                     for example use 100, 200, and so on.

                 Override -> (structure)
                     The action that allows the policy owner to  override  the
                     behavior of the rule group within a policy.

                     Action -> (string)
                        The  action  that  changes the rule group from DROP to
                        ALERT . This only applies to managed rule groups.

          StatefulDefaultActions -> (list)
              The default actions to take on a packet that doesn't  match  any
              stateful  rules. The stateful default action is optional, and is
              only valid when using the strict rule order.

              Valid values of the stateful default action:

              o aws:drop_strict

              o aws:drop_established

              o aws:alert_strict

              o aws:alert_established

              For more information, see Strict evaluation order in the Network
              Firewall Developer Guide .

              (string)

          StatefulEngineOptions -> (structure)
              Additional options governing how Network Firewall handles state-
              ful rules. The stateful rule groups that you use in your  policy
              must  have  stateful  rule  options settings that are compatible
              with these settings.

              RuleOrder -> (string)
                 Indicates how to manage the order of stateful rule evaluation
                 for the policy. DEFAULT_ACTION_ORDER is the default behavior.
                 Stateful rules are provided to the rule  engine  as  Suricata
                 compatible strings, and Suricata evaluates them based on cer-
                 tain settings. For more information, see Evaluation order for
                 stateful rules in the Network Firewall Developer Guide .

              StreamExceptionPolicy -> (string)
                 Configures how Network Firewall processes traffic when a net-
                 work connection breaks  midstream.  Network  connections  can
                 break  due  to disruptions in external networks or within the
                 firewall itself.

                 o DROP - Network Firewall fails closed and drops  all  subse-
                   quent  traffic  going  to the firewall. This is the default
                   behavior.

                 o CONTINUE - Network Firewall continues to apply rules to the
                   subsequent  traffic without context from traffic before the
                   break. This impacts the behavior of rules  that  depend  on
                   this  context.  For example, if you have a stateful rule to
                   drop http traffic, Network Firewall won't match the traffic
                   for  this  rule  because the service won't have the context
                   from session initialization defining the application  layer
                   protocol as HTTP. However, this behavior is rule dependenta
                   TCP-layer rule using  a  flow:stateless  rule  would  still
                   match, as would the aws:drop_strict default action.

          TLSInspectionConfigurationArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the TLS inspection configura-
              tion.
