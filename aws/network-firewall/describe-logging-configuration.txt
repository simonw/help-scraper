NAME
       describe-logging-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the logging configuration for the specified firewall.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-logging-configuration
          [--firewall-arn <value>]
          [--firewall-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --firewall-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --firewall-name (string)
          The descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the name of a
          firewall after you create it.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FirewallArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

       LoggingConfiguration -> (structure)
          Defines how AWS Network Firewall performs logging for a  Firewall .

          LogDestinationConfigs -> (list)
              Defines the logging destinations for the logs  for  a  firewall.
              Network Firewall generates logs for stateful rule groups.

              (structure)
                 Defines  where  AWS Network Firewall sends logs for the fire-
                 wall for one log type. This is used in   LoggingConfiguration
                 .  You  can  send  each type of log to an Amazon S3 bucket, a
                 CloudWatch log group, or a  Kinesis  Data  Firehose  delivery
                 stream.

                 Network Firewall generates logs for stateful rule groups. You
                 can save alert and flow log types. The stateful rules  engine
                 records  flow  logs for all network traffic that it receives.
                 It records alert logs for traffic that matches stateful rules
                 that have the rule action set to DROP or ALERT .

                 LogType -> (string)
                     The  type  of log to send. Alert logs report traffic that
                     matches a  StatefulRule with an action setting that sends
                     an  alert  log  message.  Flow  logs are standard network
                     traffic flow logs.

                 LogDestinationType -> (string)
                     The type of storage destination to send  these  logs  to.
                     You  can  send  logs to an Amazon S3 bucket, a CloudWatch
                     log group, or a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream.

                 LogDestination -> (map)
                     The named location for the logs, provided in a  key:value
                     mapping that is specific to the chosen destination type.

                     o For  an  Amazon  S3  bucket,  provide  the  name of the
                       bucket, with key bucketName , and optionally provide  a
                       prefix,  with key prefix . The following example speci-
                       fies an Amazon S3 bucket named  DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET  and
                       the prefix alerts :   "LogDestination": { "bucketName":
                       "DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET", "prefix": "alerts" }

                     o For a CloudWatch log group, provide  the  name  of  the
                       CloudWatch log group, with key logGroup . The following
                       example specifies a log group named  alert-log-group  :
                       "LogDestination": { "logGroup": "alert-log-group" }

                     o For  a  Kinesis  Data Firehose delivery stream, provide
                       the name of the delivery stream,  with  key  deliveryS-
                       tream  .  The  following  example  specifies a delivery
                       stream  named  alert-delivery-stream  :    "LogDestina-
                       tion": { "deliveryStream": "alert-delivery-stream" }

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)
