UPDATE-LOGGING-CONFIGURATION()                  UPDATE-LOGGING-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       update-logging-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets the logging configuration for the specified firewall.

       To change the logging configuration, retrieve the  LoggingConfiguration
       by calling  DescribeLoggingConfiguration , then change it  and  provide
       the  modified  object  to this update call. You must change the logging
       configuration one  LogDestinationConfig at a time inside the  retrieved
       LoggingConfiguration object.

       You  can  perform  only one of the following actions in any call to Up-
       dateLoggingConfiguration :

       o Create a new log destination object by adding  a  single  LogDestina-
         tionConfig array element to LogDestinationConfigs .

       o Delete  a log destination object by removing a single LogDestination-
         Config array element from LogDestinationConfigs .

       o Change the LogDestination setting in  a  single  LogDestinationConfig
         array element.

       You can't change the LogDestinationType or LogType in a LogDestination-
       Config . To change these settings, delete the existing  LogDestination-
       Config  object  and  create a new one, using two separate calls to this
       update operation.

OPTIONS
       --firewall-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --firewall-name (string)
          The descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the name of a
          firewall after you create it.

          You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

       --logging-configuration (structure)
          Defines how Network Firewall performs logging for a firewall. If you
          omit this setting, Network Firewall disables logging for  the  fire-
          wall.

          LogDestinationConfigs -> (list)
              Defines  the  logging  destinations for the logs for a firewall.
              Network Firewall generates logs for stateful rule groups.

              (structure)
                 Defines where Network Firewall sends logs  for  the  firewall
                 for one log type. This is used in  LoggingConfiguration . You
                 can send each type of log to an Amazon S3  bucket,  a  Cloud-
                 Watch log group, or a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream.

                 Network Firewall generates logs for stateful rule groups. You
                 can save alert and flow log types. The stateful rules  engine
                 records  flow  logs for all network traffic that it receives.
                 It records alert logs for traffic that matches stateful rules
                 that have the rule action set to DROP or ALERT .

                 LogType -> (string)
                     The  type  of log to send. Alert logs report traffic that
                     matches a  StatefulRule with an action setting that sends
                     an  alert  log  message.  Flow  logs are standard network
                     traffic flow logs.

                 LogDestinationType -> (string)
                     The type of storage destination to send  these  logs  to.
                     You  can  send  logs to an Amazon S3 bucket, a CloudWatch
                     log group, or a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream.

                 LogDestination -> (map)
                     The named location for the logs, provided in a  key:value
                     mapping that is specific to the chosen destination type.

                     o For  an  Amazon  S3  bucket,  provide  the  name of the
                       bucket, with key bucketName , and optionally provide  a
                       prefix,  with key prefix . The following example speci-
                       fies an Amazon S3 bucket named  DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET  and
                       the prefix alerts :   "LogDestination": { "bucketName":
                       "DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET", "prefix": "alerts" }

                     o For a CloudWatch log group, provide  the  name  of  the
                       CloudWatch log group, with key logGroup . The following
                       example specifies a log group named  alert-log-group  :
                       "LogDestination": { "logGroup": "alert-log-group" }

                     o For  a  Kinesis  Data Firehose delivery stream, provide
                       the name of the delivery stream,  with  key  deliveryS-
                       tream  .  The  following  example  specifies a delivery
                       stream  named  alert-delivery-stream  :    "LogDestina-
                       tion": { "deliveryStream": "alert-delivery-stream" }

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          LogDestinationConfigs=[{LogType=string,LogDestinationType=string,LogDestination={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string}},{LogType=string,LogDestinationType=string,LogDestination={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string}}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "LogDestinationConfigs": [
              {
                "LogType": "ALERT"|"FLOW",
                "LogDestinationType": "S3"|"CloudWatchLogs"|"KinesisDataFirehose",
                "LogDestination": {"string": "string"
                  ...}
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
