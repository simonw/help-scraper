LIST-RULE-GROUPS()                                          LIST-RULE-GROUPS()



NAME
       list-rule-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  metadata for the rule groups that you have defined. De-
       pending on your setting for max results and the number of rule  groups,
       a single call might not return the full list.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-rule-groups  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: RuleGroups

OPTIONS
       --scope (string)
          The scope of the request. The default setting of ACCOUNT or  a  set-
          ting  of NULL returns all of the rule groups in your account. A set-
          ting of MANAGED returns all available managed rule groups.

          Possible values:

          o MANAGED

          o ACCOUNT

       --managed-type (string)
          Indicates the general category of the Amazon  Web  Services  managed
          rule group.

          Possible values:

          o AWS_MANAGED_THREAT_SIGNATURES

          o AWS_MANAGED_DOMAIN_LISTS

       --type (string)
          Indicates  whether  the  rule group is stateless or stateful. If the
          rule group is stateless, it  contains  stateless  rules.  If  it  is
          stateful, it contains stateful rules.

          Possible values:

          o STATELESS

          o STATEFUL

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          When you request a list of objects with a MaxResults setting, if the
          number of objects that are still available for retrieval exceeds the
          maximum you requested, Network Firewall returns a NextToken value in
          the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, use  the  token
          returned from the prior request in your next request.

       RuleGroups -> (list)
          The  rule  group  metadata objects that you've defined. Depending on
          your setting for max results and the number  of  rule  groups,  this
          might not be the full list.

          (structure)
              High-level   information   about   a  rule  group,  returned  by
              ListRuleGroups . You can use the  information  provided  in  the
              metadata to retrieve and manage a rule group.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  descriptive name of the rule group. You can't change the
                 name of a rule group after you create it.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule group.
