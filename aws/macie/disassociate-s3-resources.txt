SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-s3-resources
          [--member-account-id <value>]
          --associated-s3-resources <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --member-account-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Macie Classic member  account  whose  resources
          you want to remove from being monitored by Macie Classic.

       --associated-s3-resources (list)
          The  S3 resources (buckets or prefixes) that you want to remove from
          being monitored and classified by Amazon Macie Classic.

          (structure)
              Contains information about the S3 resource. This  data  type  is
              used  as  a request parameter in the DisassociateS3Resources ac-
              tion and can be used  as  a  response  parameter  in  the  Asso-
              ciateS3Resources and UpdateS3Resources actions.

              bucketName -> (string)
                 The name of the S3 bucket.

              prefix -> (string)
                 The prefix of the S3 bucket.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          bucketName=string,prefix=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "bucketName": "string",
              "prefix": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       failedS3Resources -> (list)
          S3 resources that couldn't be removed from being monitored and clas-
          sified by Amazon Macie Classic. An error code and an  error  message
          are provided for each failed item.

              failedItem -> (structure)

                 bucketName -> (string)

                 prefix -> (string)
                     The prefix of the S3 bucket.

              errorCode -> (string)
