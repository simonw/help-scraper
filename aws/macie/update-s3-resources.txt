NAME
       update-s3-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  classification  types  for the specified S3 resources. If
       memberAccountId isn't specified, the action updates the  classification
       types  of the S3 resources associated with Amazon Macie Classic for the
       current Macie Classic  administrator  account.  If  memberAccountId  is
       specified,  the  action  updates the classification types of the S3 re-
       sources associated with Macie Classic for the specified member account.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-s3-resources
          [--member-account-id <value>]
          --s3-resources-update <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --member-account-id (string)
          The AWS ID of the Amazon Macie Classic member account whose  S3  re-
          sources' classification types you want to update.

       --s3-resources-update (list)
          The S3 resources whose classification types you want to update.

          (structure)
              The  S3 resources whose classification types you want to update.
              This data type is used as a request parameter in the UpdateS3Re-
              sources action.

              bucketName -> (string)
                 The name of the S3 bucket whose classification types you want
                 to update.

              prefix -> (string)
                 The prefix of the S3 bucket whose  classification  types  you
                 want to update.

              classificationTypeUpdate -> (structure)
                 The  classification  type that you want to update for the re-
                 source associated with Amazon Macie Classic.

                 oneTime -> (string)
                     A one-time classification of all of the existing  objects
                     in a specified S3 bucket.

                 continuous -> (string)
                     A continuous classification of the objects that are added
                     to a specified S3 bucket.  Amazon  Macie  Classic  begins
                     performing  continuous  classification  after a bucket is
                     successfully associated with Macie Classic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          bucketName=string,prefix=string,classificationTypeUpdate={oneTime=string,continuous=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "bucketName": "string",
              "prefix": "string",
              "classificationTypeUpdate": {
                "oneTime": "FULL"|"NONE",
                "continuous": "FULL"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       failedS3Resources -> (list)

              Includes details about the failed S3 resources.

              failedItem -> (structure)

                 bucketName -> (string)

                 prefix -> (string)
                     The prefix of the S3 bucket.

              errorCode -> (string)
