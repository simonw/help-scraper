SYNOPSIS
            associate-s3-resources
          [--member-account-id <value>]
          --s3-resources <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --member-account-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Macie Classic member  account  whose  resources
          you want to associate with Macie Classic.

       --s3-resources (list)
          The  S3 resources that you want to associate with Amazon Macie Clas-
          sic for monitoring and data classification.

          (structure)
              The S3 resources that you want to associate  with  Amazon  Macie
              Classic  for  monitoring and data classification. This data type
              is used as a request parameter in the  AssociateS3Resources  ac-
              tion and a response parameter in the ListS3Resources action.

              bucketName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  S3 bucket that you want to associate with
                 Amazon Macie Classic.

              prefix -> (string)
                 The prefix of the S3 bucket that you want to  associate  with
                 Amazon Macie Classic.

              classificationType -> (structure)
                 The  classification type that you want to specify for the re-
                 source associated with Amazon Macie Classic.

                 oneTime -> (string)
                     A one-time classification of all of the existing  objects
                     in a specified S3 bucket.

                 continuous -> (string)
                     A continuous classification of the objects that are added
                     to a specified S3 bucket.  Amazon  Macie  Classic  begins
                     performing  continuous  classification  after a bucket is
                     successfully associated with Macie Classic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          bucketName=string,prefix=string,classificationType={oneTime=string,continuous=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "bucketName": "string",
              "prefix": "string",
              "classificationType": {
                "oneTime": "FULL"|"NONE",
                "continuous": "FULL"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
