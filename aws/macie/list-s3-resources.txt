LIST-S3-RESOURCES()                                        LIST-S3-RESOURCES()



NAME
       list-s3-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  the  S3  resources associated with Amazon Macie Classic. If
       memberAccountId isn't specified, the action lists the S3 resources  as-
       sociated with Macie Classic for the current Macie Classic administrator
       account. If memberAccountId is specified, the action lists the  S3  re-
       sources associated with Macie Classic for the specified member account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-s3-resources  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: s3Resources

SYNOPSIS
            list-s3-resources
          [--member-account-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --member-account-id (string)
          The Amazon Macie Classic member account ID whose associated  S3  re-
          sources you want to list.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       s3Resources -> (list)
          A list of the associated S3 resources returned by the action.

          (structure)
              The  S3  resources  that you want to associate with Amazon Macie
              Classic for monitoring and data classification. This  data  type
              is  used  as a request parameter in the AssociateS3Resources ac-
              tion and a response parameter in the ListS3Resources action.

              bucketName -> (string)
                 The name of the S3 bucket that you  want  to  associate  with
                 Amazon Macie Classic.

              prefix -> (string)
                 The  prefix  of the S3 bucket that you want to associate with
                 Amazon Macie Classic.

              classificationType -> (structure)
                 The classification type that you want to specify for the  re-
                 source associated with Amazon Macie Classic.

                 oneTime -> (string)
                     A  one-time classification of all of the existing objects
                     in a specified S3 bucket.

                 continuous -> (string)
                     A continuous classification of the objects that are added
                     to  a  specified  S3  bucket. Amazon Macie Classic begins
                     performing continuous classification after  a  bucket  is
                     successfully associated with Macie Classic.

       nextToken -> (string)
          When  a  response  is generated, if there is more data to be listed,
          this parameter is present in the response and contains the value  to
          use  for the nextToken parameter in a subsequent pagination request.
          If there is no more data to be listed,  this  parameter  is  set  to
          null.
