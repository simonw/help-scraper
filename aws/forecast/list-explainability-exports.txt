LIST-EXPLAINABILITY-EXPORTS()                    LIST-EXPLAINABILITY-EXPORTS()



NAME
       list-explainability-exports -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of Explainability exports created using the  CreateEx-
       plainabilityExport operation. This operation returns a summary for each
       Explainability  export. You can filter the list using an array of  Fil-
       ter objects.

       To retrieve the complete set of properties for  a  particular  Explain-
       ability export, use the ARN with the  DescribeExplainability operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-explainability-exports
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          If  the  result  of the previous request was truncated, the response
          includes a NextToken. To retrieve the next set of results,  use  the
          token in the next request. Tokens expire after 24 hours.

       --max-results (integer)
          The number of items to return in the response.

       --filters (list)
          An  array  of  filters.  For  each filter, provide a condition and a
          match statement. The condition is either IS or IS_NOT , which speci-
          fies  whether  to include or exclude resources that match the state-
          ment from the list. The match statement consists  of  a  key  and  a
          value.
              Filter properties

          o Condition - The condition to apply. Valid values are IS and IS_NOT
            .

          o Key - The name of the parameter to filter on. Valid values are Re-
            sourceArn and Status .

          o Value - The value to match.

          (structure)
              Describes a filter for choosing a subset of objects. Each filter
              consists of a condition and a match statement. The condition  is
              either  IS or IS_NOT , which specifies whether to include or ex-
              clude the objects that match the  statement,  respectively.  The
              match statement consists of a key and a value.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the parameter to filter on.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value to match.

              Condition -> (string)
                 The condition to apply. To include the objects that match the
                 statement, specify IS . To exclude matching objects,  specify
                 IS_NOT .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,Condition=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "Condition": "IS"|"IS_NOT"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ExplainabilityExports -> (list)
          An  array  of objects that summarize the properties of each Explain-
          ability export.

          (structure)
              Provides a summary of the Explainability export properties  used
              in  the   ListExplainabilityExports operation. To get a complete
              set of properties, call the  DescribeExplainabilityExport opera-
              tion, and provide the ExplainabilityExportArn .

              ExplainabilityExportArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Explainability export.

              ExplainabilityExportName -> (string)
                 The name of the Explainability export

              Destination -> (structure)
                 The destination for an export job. Provide an S3 path, an AWS
                 Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that allows  Amazon
                 Forecast  to  access  the location, and an AWS Key Management
                 Service (KMS) key (optional).

                 S3Config -> (structure)
                     The path to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon  S3)
                     bucket along with the credentials to access the bucket.

                     Path -> (string)
                        The  path  to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon
                        S3) bucket or file(s) in an Amazon S3 bucket.

                     RoleArn -> (string)
                        The ARN of the  AWS  Identity  and  Access  Management
                        (IAM)  role  that Amazon Forecast can assume to access
                        the Amazon S3 bucket or files. If you provide a  value
                        for  the  KMSKeyArn key, the role must allow access to
                        the key.

                        Passing a role across AWS accounts is not allowed.  If
                        you pass a role that isn't in your account, you get an
                        InvalidInputException error.

                     KMSKeyArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS  Key  Manage-
                        ment Service (KMS) key.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the Explainability export. States include:

                 o ACTIVE

                 o CREATE_PENDING , CREATE_IN_PROGRESS , CREATE_FAILED

                 o CREATE_STOPPING , CREATE_STOPPED

                 o DELETE_PENDING , DELETE_IN_PROGRESS , DELETE_FAILED

              Message -> (string)
                 Information  about  any  errors that may have occurred during
                 the Explainability export.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the Explainability was created.

              LastModificationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The last time the resource was modified.  The  timestamp  de-
                 pends on the status of the job:

                 o CREATE_PENDING - The CreationTime .

                 o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS - The current timestamp.

                 o CREATE_STOPPING - The current timestamp.

                 o CREATE_STOPPED - When the job stopped.

                 o ACTIVE or CREATE_FAILED - When the job finished or failed.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Returns  this  token  if  the response is truncated. To retrieve the
          next set of results, use the token in the next request.
