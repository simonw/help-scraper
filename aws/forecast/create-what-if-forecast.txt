NAME
       create-what-if-forecast -

DESCRIPTION
       A  what-if  forecast is a forecast that is created from a modified ver-
       sion of the baseline forecast. Each what-if forecast  incorporates  ei-
       ther  a replacement dataset or a set of transformations to the original
       dataset.

OPTIONS
       --what-if-forecast-name (string)
          The name of the what-if forecast. Names must be unique  within  each
          what-if analysis.

       --what-if-analysis-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the what-if analysis.

       --time-series-transformations (list)
          The  transformations  that  are applied to the baseline time series.
          Each transformation contains an action and a set of  conditions.  An
          action is applied only when all conditions are met. If no conditions
          are provided, the action is applied to all items.

          (structure)
              A transformation function is a pair of  operations  that  select
              and  modify  the  rows  in a related time series. You select the
              rows that you want with a condition operation and you modify the
              rows  with a transformation operation. All conditions are joined
              with an AND operation, meaning that all conditions must be  true
              for  the  transformation  to be applied. Transformations are ap-
              plied in the order that they are listed.

              Action -> (structure)
                 An array of actions that define a time series and how  it  is
                 transformed.  These  transformations create a new time series
                 that is used for the what-if analysis.

                 AttributeName -> (string)
                     The related time series  that  you  are  modifying.  This
                     value is case insensitive.

                 Operation -> (string)
                     The  operation that is applied to the provided attribute.
                     Operations include:

                     o ADD - adds Value to all rows of AttributeName .

                     o SUBTRACT - subtracts Value from all rows of  Attribute-
                       Name .

                     o MULTIPLY  -  multiplies  all  rows  of AttributeName by
                       Value .

                     o DIVIDE - divides all rows of AttributeName by Value .

                 Value -> (double)
                     The value that is applied for the chosen Operation .

              TimeSeriesConditions -> (list)
                 An array of conditions that define which members of  the  re-
                 lated time series are transformed.

                 (structure)
                     Creates  a  subset  of items within an attribute that are
                     modified. For example, you can use this operation to cre-
                     ate  a  subset of items that cost $5 or less. To do this,
                     you specify "AttributeName": "price" ,  "AttributeValue":
                     "5"  , and "Condition": "LESS_THAN" . Pair this operation
                     with the  Action operation within the   CreateWhatIfFore-
                     castRequest$TimeSeriesTransformations operation to define
                     how the attribute is modified.

                     AttributeName -> (string)
                        The item_id, dimension name,  IM  name,  or  timestamp
                        that you are modifying.

                     AttributeValue -> (string)
                        The value that is applied for the chosen Condition .

                     Condition -> (string)
                        The  condition  to  apply.  Valid  values are EQUALS ,
                        NOT_EQUALS , LESS_THAN and GREATER_THAN .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Action={AttributeName=string,Operation=string,Value=double},TimeSeriesConditions=[{AttributeName=string,AttributeValue=string,Condition=string},{AttributeName=string,AttributeValue=string,Condition=string}] ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Action": {
                "AttributeName": "string",
                "Operation": "ADD"|"SUBTRACT"|"MULTIPLY"|"DIVIDE",
                "Value": double
              },
              "TimeSeriesConditions": [
                {
                  "AttributeName": "string",
                  "AttributeValue": "string",
                  "Condition": "EQUALS"|"NOT_EQUALS"|"LESS_THAN"|"GREATER_THAN"
                }
                ...
              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --time-series-replacements-data-source (structure)
          The replacement time series dataset, which contains  the  rows  that
          you want to change in the related time series dataset. A replacement
          time series does not need to contain all rows that are in the  base-
          line  related  time series. Include only the rows (measure-dimension
          combinations) that you want to include in the what-if forecast.

          This dataset is merged with the original time  series  to  create  a
          transformed dataset that is used for the what-if analysis.

          This  dataset should contain the items to modify (such as item_id or
          workforce_type), any relevant dimensions, the timestamp column,  and
          at  least  one  of the related time series columns. This file should
          not contain duplicate timestamps for the same time series.

          Timestamps and item_ids not included in this  dataset  are  not  in-
          cluded in the what-if analysis.

          S3Config -> (structure)
              The  path  to  the  file(s)  in an Amazon Simple Storage Service
              (Amazon S3) bucket, and an Identity and Access Management  (IAM)
              role  that Amazon Forecast can assume to access the file(s). Op-
              tionally, includes an Key Management Service (KMS) key. This ob-
              ject  is part of the  DataSource object that is submitted in the
              CreateDatasetImportJob request, and part of the  DataDestination
              object.

              Path -> (string)
                 The  path  to  an  Amazon  Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
                 bucket or file(s) in an Amazon S3 bucket.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that
                 Amazon  Forecast can assume to access the Amazon S3 bucket or
                 files. If you provide a value for the KMSKeyArn key, the role
                 must allow access to the key.

                 Passing a role across Amazon Web Services accounts is not al-
                 lowed. If you pass a role that isn't in your account, you get
                 an InvalidInputException error.

              KMSKeyArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of an Key Management Service
                 (KMS) key.

          Schema -> (structure)
              Defines the fields of a dataset.

              Attributes -> (list)
                 An array of attributes specifying the name and type  of  each
                 field in a dataset.

                 (structure)
                     An  attribute of a schema, which defines a dataset field.
                     A schema attribute is  required  for  every  field  in  a
                     dataset. The Schema object contains an array of SchemaAt-
                     tribute objects.

                     AttributeName -> (string)
                        The name of the dataset field.

                     AttributeType -> (string)
                        The data type of the field.

                        For a related time series dataset,  other  than  date,
                        item_id,  and  forecast dimensions attributes, all at-
                        tributes should be of numerical type (integer/float).

          Format -> (string)
              The format of the replacement data, CSV or PARQUET.

          TimestampFormat -> (string)
              The timestamp format of the replacement data.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Config": {
              "Path": "string",
              "RoleArn": "string",
              "KMSKeyArn": "string"
            },
            "Schema": {
              "Attributes": [
                {
                  "AttributeName": "string",
                  "AttributeType": "string"|"integer"|"float"|"timestamp"|"geolocation"
                }
                ...
              ]
            },
            "Format": "string",
            "TimestampFormat": "string"
          }

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags to apply to the what if forecast.

          (structure)
              The optional metadata that you apply to a resource to  help  you
              categorize  and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an
              optional value, both of which you define.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

              o For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and  each  tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

              o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

              o If  your  tagging  schema is used across multiple services and
                resources, remember that other services may have  restrictions
                on  allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
                lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.

              o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

              o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination
                of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for Amazon  Web
                Services  use.  You  cannot  edit or delete tag keys with this
                prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as
                its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to
                be a user tag and will count against the  limit  of  50  tags.
                Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not count against your
                tags per resource limit.

              Key -> (string)
                 One part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A key is  a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag.  A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       WhatIfForecastArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the what-if forecast.
