CREATE-PREDICTOR()                                          CREATE-PREDICTOR()



NAME
       create-predictor -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  operation creates a legacy predictor that does not include all
          the predictor functionalities provided by Amazon Forecast. To create
          a  predictor  that  is  compatible with all aspects of Forecast, use
          CreateAutoPredictor .

       Creates an Amazon Forecast predictor.

       In the request, provide a dataset group and either specify an algorithm
       or let Amazon Forecast choose an algorithm for you using AutoML. If you
       specify an algorithm, you also can override algorithm-specific hyperpa-
       rameters.

       Amazon  Forecast uses the algorithm to train a predictor using the lat-
       est version of the datasets in the specified  dataset  group.  You  can
       then generate a forecast using the  CreateForecast operation.

       To see the evaluation metrics, use the  GetAccuracyMetrics operation.

       You can specify a featurization configuration to fill and aggregate the
       data fields in the TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset to improve  model  train-
       ing. For more information, see  FeaturizationConfig .

       For  RELATED_TIME_SERIES  datasets,  CreatePredictor  verifies that the
       DataFrequency specified when the dataset was created matches the  Fore-
       castFrequency  .  TARGET_TIME_SERIES  datasets don't have this restric-
       tion. Amazon Forecast also verifies the delimiter and timestamp format.
       For more information, see  howitworks-datasets-groups .

       By  default, predictors are trained and evaluated at the 0.1 (P10), 0.5
       (P50), and 0.9 (P90) quantiles. You can choose custom forecast types to
       train and evaluate your predictor by setting the ForecastTypes .
          AutoML

       If  you  want Amazon Forecast to evaluate each algorithm and choose the
       one that minimizes the objective function , set PerformAutoML to true .
       The  objective  function  is defined as the mean of the weighted losses
       over the forecast types. By default, these are the p10,  p50,  and  p90
       quantile losses. For more information, see  EvaluationResult .

       When AutoML is enabled, the following properties are disallowed:

       o AlgorithmArn

       o HPOConfig

       o PerformHPO

       o TrainingParameters

       To get a list of all of your predictors, use the  ListPredictors opera-
       tion.

       NOTE:
          Before you can use the predictor to create a forecast, the Status of
          the  predictor  must  be  ACTIVE , signifying that training has com-
          pleted. To get the status, use the  DescribePredictor operation.

OPTIONS
       --predictor-name (string)
          A name for the predictor.

       --algorithm-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the algorithm  to  use  for  model
          training. Required if PerformAutoML is not set to true .
              Supported algorithms:

          o arn:aws:forecast:::algorithm/ARIMA

          o arn:aws:forecast:::algorithm/CNN-QR

          o arn:aws:forecast:::algorithm/Deep_AR_Plus

          o arn:aws:forecast:::algorithm/ETS

          o arn:aws:forecast:::algorithm/NPTS

          o arn:aws:forecast:::algorithm/Prophet

       --forecast-horizon (integer)
          Specifies the number of time-steps that the model is trained to pre-
          dict. The forecast horizon is also called the prediction length.

          For example, if you configure a dataset for  daily  data  collection
          (using  the DataFrequency parameter of the  CreateDataset operation)
          and set the forecast horizon to 10, the  model  returns  predictions
          for 10 days.

          The  maximum forecast horizon is the lesser of 500 time-steps or 1/3
          of the TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset length.

       --forecast-types (list)
          Specifies the forecast types used to  train  a  predictor.  You  can
          specify  up  to five forecast types. Forecast types can be quantiles
          from 0.01 to 0.99, by increments of 0.01 or  higher.  You  can  also
          specify the mean forecast with mean .

          The default value is ["0.10", "0.50", "0.9"] .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --perform-auto-ml | --no-perform-auto-ml (boolean)
          Whether  to perform AutoML. When Amazon Forecast performs AutoML, it
          evaluates the algorithms it provides and chooses the best  algorithm
          and configuration for your training dataset.

          The default value is false . In this case, you are required to spec-
          ify an algorithm.

          Set PerformAutoML to true to have Amazon  Forecast  perform  AutoML.
          This is a good option if you aren't sure which algorithm is suitable
          for your training data. In this case, PerformHPO must be false.

       --auto-ml-override-strategy (string)

          NOTE:
              The LatencyOptimized AutoML override strategy is only  available
              in  private beta. Contact AWS Support or your account manager to
              learn more about access privileges.

          Used to overide the default AutoML strategy, which  is  to  optimize
          predictor  accuracy.  To  apply  an  AutoML  strategy that minimizes
          training time, use LatencyOptimized .

          This parameter is only valid for predictors trained using AutoML.

          Possible values:

          o LatencyOptimized

          o AccuracyOptimized

       --perform-hpo | --no-perform-hpo (boolean)
          Whether to perform hyperparameter optimization (HPO). HPO finds  op-
          timal  hyperparameter  values for your training data. The process of
          performing HPO is known as running a hyperparameter tuning job.

          The default value is false . In this case, Amazon Forecast uses  de-
          fault hyperparameter values from the chosen algorithm.

          To  override the default values, set PerformHPO to true and, option-
          ally, supply the  HyperParameterTuningJobConfig object.  The  tuning
          job  specifies  a metric to optimize, which hyperparameters partici-
          pate in tuning, and the valid range for each tunable hyperparameter.
          In  this  case, you are required to specify an algorithm and Perfor-
          mAutoML must be false.

          The following algorithms support HPO:

          o DeepAR+

          o CNN-QR

       --training-parameters (map)
          The hyperparameters to override for model training. The hyperparame-
          ters  that you can override are listed in the individual algorithms.
          For the  list  of  supported  algorithms,  see   aws-forecast-choos-
          ing-recipes .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --evaluation-parameters (structure)
          Used  to override the default evaluation parameters of the specified
          algorithm. Amazon Forecast evaluates  a  predictor  by  splitting  a
          dataset  into training data and testing data. The evaluation parame-
          ters define how to perform the split and the number of iterations.

          NumberOfBacktestWindows -> (integer)
              The number of times to split the input data. The default  is  1.
              Valid values are 1 through 5.

          BackTestWindowOffset -> (integer)
              The  point  from  the end of the dataset where you want to split
              the data for model training and  testing  (evaluation).  Specify
              the value as the number of data points. The default is the value
              of the forecast horizon. BackTestWindowOffset  can  be  used  to
              mimic  a  past  virtual  forecast start date. This value must be
              greater than or equal to the forecast horizon and less than half
              of the TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset length.
                 ForecastHorizon   <=   BackTestWindowOffset   <  1/2  *  TAR-
                 GET_TIME_SERIES dataset length

       Shorthand Syntax:

          NumberOfBacktestWindows=integer,BackTestWindowOffset=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "NumberOfBacktestWindows": integer,
            "BackTestWindowOffset": integer
          }

       --hpo-config (structure)
          Provides hyperparameter override values for the  algorithm.  If  you
          don't  provide  this parameter, Amazon Forecast uses default values.
          The individual algorithms specify which hyperparameters support  hy-
          perparameter   optimization   (HPO).   For   more  information,  see
          aws-forecast-choosing-recipes .

          If you included the HPOConfig object, you  must  set  PerformHPO  to
          true.

          ParameterRanges -> (structure)
              Specifies the ranges of valid values for the hyperparameters.

              CategoricalParameterRanges -> (list)
                 Specifies the tunable range for each categorical hyperparame-
                 ter.

                     Specifies a categorical hyperparameter and it's range  of
                     tunable  values.  This  object is part of the  Parameter-
                     Ranges object.

                     Name -> (string)

                        A list of the tunable categories for the  hyperparame-
                        ter.

                        (string)

              ContinuousParameterRanges -> (list)
                 Specifies  the tunable range for each continuous hyperparame-
                 ter.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies a continuous hyperparameter and it's  range  of
                     tunable  values.  This  object is part of the  Parameter-
                     Ranges object.

                     MaxValue -> (double)
                        The maximum tunable value of the hyperparameter.

                     MinValue -> (double)
                        The minimum tunable value of the hyperparameter.

                     ScalingType -> (string)
                        The scale that hyperparameter tuning  uses  to  search
                        the hyperparameter range. Valid values:
                            Auto

                        Amazon Forecast hyperparameter tuning chooses the best
                        scale for the hyperparameter.
                            Linear

                        Hyperparameter tuning searches the values in  the  hy-
                        perparameter range by using a linear scale.

                        perparameter range by using a logarithmic scale.

                        Logarithmic scaling works only for  ranges  that  have
                        values greater than 0.
                            ReverseLogarithmic

                        hyperparameter  tuning  searches the values in the hy-
                        perparameter range  by  using  a  reverse  logarithmic
                        scale.

                        Reverse logarithmic scaling works only for ranges that
                        are entirely within the range 0 <= x < 1.0.

       --featurization-config (structure)
          The featurization configuration.

          ForecastFrequency -> (string)
              The frequency of predictions in a forecast.

              Valid intervals are Y (Year), M (Month), W (Week),  D  (Day),  H
              (Hour),  30min  (30 minutes), 15min (15 minutes), 10min (10 min-
              utes), 5min (5 minutes), and 1min (1 minute). For  example,  "Y"
              indicates every year and "5min" indicates every five minutes.

              The  frequency  must  be  greater  than  or  equal  to  the TAR-
              GET_TIME_SERIES dataset frequency.

              When a RELATED_TIME_SERIES dataset is  provided,  the  frequency
              must be equal to the RELATED_TIME_SERIES dataset frequency.

          ForecastDimensions -> (list)
              An  array  of  dimension (field) names that specify how to group
              the generated forecast.

              For example, suppose that you are generating a forecast for item
              sales  across  all  of  your stores, and your dataset contains a
              store_id field. If you want the sales forecast for each item  by
              store, you would specify store_id as the dimension.

              All  forecast  dimensions  specified  in  the TARGET_TIME_SERIES
              dataset don't need to be specified in  the  CreatePredictor  re-
              quest. All forecast dimensions specified in the RELATED_TIME_SE-
              RIES dataset must be specified in the CreatePredictor request.

                     LATED_TIME_SERIES  datasets.  For example, for the RETAIL
                     domain, the target is demand , and for the CUSTOM domain,
                     the  target  is  target_value . For more information, see
                     howitworks-missing-values .

                 FeaturizationPipeline -> (list)
                     An array of one FeaturizationMethod object that specifies
                     the feature transformation method.

                     (structure)
                        Provides  information about the method that featurizes
                        (transforms) a dataset field. The method  is  part  of

                        FeaturizationMethodParameters -> (map)
                            The method parameters (key-value pairs), which are
                            a map of override parameters. Specify these param-
                            eters to override the default values. Related Time

              cess the AWS KMS key.

              Passing a role across AWS accounts is not allowed. If you pass a
              role that isn't in your account, you get  an  InvalidInputExcep-
              tion error.

       --tags (list)
          The  optional  metadata  that you apply to the predictor to help you
          categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an  op-
          tional value, both of which you define.

          The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

          o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

          o For  each  resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key
            can have only one value.

          o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

          o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

          o If your tagging schema is used across multiple  services  and  re-
            sources, remember that other services may have restrictions on al-
            lowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters,  num-
            bers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following charac-
            ters: + - = . _ : / @.

          o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

          o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination  of
            such  as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You can-
            not edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this
            prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does not,
            then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against
            the  limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not
            count against your tags per resource limit.

                and will count against the limit of 50 tags.  Tags  with  only
                the  key  prefix of aws do not count against your tags per re-
                source limit.

              Key -> (string)
                 One part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A key is  a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag.  A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
