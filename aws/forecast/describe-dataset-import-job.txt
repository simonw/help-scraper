       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-dataset-import-job
          --dataset-import-job-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dataset-import-job-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset import job.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          The name of the dataset import job.

          was imported to.

       TimestampFormat -> (string)
          The format of timestamps in the dataset. The format that you specify
          depends on the DataFrequency specified when the dataset was created.
          The following formats are supported

          o "yyyy-MM-dd" For the following data frequencies: Y, M, W, and D

          o "yyyy-MM-dd  HH:mm:ss"  For  the  following  data  frequencies: H,
            30min, 15min, and 1min; and optionally, for: Y, M, W, and D

       TimeZone -> (string)
          The single time zone applied to every item in the dataset

       UseGeolocationForTimeZone -> (boolean)

          tribute.

       GeolocationFormat -> (string)

          "CC_POSTALCODE" .

       DataSource -> (structure)

          Access  Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to ac-
          cess the data.

          If encryption is used, DataSource includes  an  AWS  Key  Management
          Service (KMS) key.

          S3Config -> (structure)
              The  path to the data stored in an Amazon Simple Storage Service
              (Amazon S3) bucket along with  the  credentials  to  access  the
              data.

              Path -> (string)
                 The  path  to  an  Amazon  Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)

                 The ARN of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)  role
                 that  Amazon  Forecast  can  assume  to  access the Amazon S3
                 bucket or files. If you provide a  value  for  the  KMSKeyArn
                 key, the role must allow access to the key.

                 Passing  a  role  across  AWS accounts is not allowed. If you
                 pass a role that isn't in your account, you get an InvalidIn-

              KMSKeyArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Key Management Ser-
                 vice (KMS) key.
