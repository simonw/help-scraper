LIST-DATASET-IMPORT-JOBS()                          LIST-DATASET-IMPORT-JOBS()



NAME
       list-dataset-import-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns   a   list   of   dataset   import   jobs   created  using  the
       CreateDatasetImportJob operation. For each import job,  this  operation
       returns a summary of its properties, including its Amazon Resource Name
       (ARN). You can retrieve the complete set of properties by using the ARN
       with the DescribeDatasetImportJob operation. You can filter the list by
       providing an array of Filter objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-dataset-import-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: DatasetImportJobs

SYNOPSIS
            list-dataset-import-jobs
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An  array of filters. For each filter, you provide a condition and a
          match statement. The condition is either IS or IS_NOT , which speci-
          fies  whether  to  include  or  exclude  the datasets that match the
          statement from the list, respectively. The match statement  consists
          of a key and a value.
              Filter properties

          o Condition - The condition to apply. Valid values are IS and IS_NOT
            . To include the datasets that match the statement, specify  IS  .
            To exclude matching datasets, specify IS_NOT .

          o Key  -  The  name  of the parameter to filter on. Valid values are
            DatasetArn and Status .

          o Value - The value to match.

          For example, to list all dataset import jobs whose status is ACTIVE,
          you specify the following filter:
              "Filters": [ { "Condition": "IS", "Key": "Status", "Value": "AC-
              TIVE" } ]

          (structure)
              Describes a filter for choosing a subset of objects. Each filter
              consists  of a condition and a match statement. The condition is
              either IS or IS_NOT , which specifies whether to include or  ex-
              clude  the  objects  that match the statement, respectively. The
              match statement consists of a key and a value.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the parameter to filter on.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value to match.

              Condition -> (string)
                 The condition to apply. To include the objects that match the
                 statement,  specify IS . To exclude matching objects, specify
                 IS_NOT .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,Condition=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "Condition": "IS"|"IS_NOT"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DatasetImportJobs -> (list)
          An array of objects that summarize each dataset import job's proper-
          ties.

          (structure)
              Provides  a summary of the dataset import job properties used in
              the ListDatasetImportJobs operation. To get the complete set  of
              properties,  call  the  DescribeDatasetImportJob  operation, and
              provide the DatasetImportJobArn .

              DatasetImportJobArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset import job.

              DatasetImportJobName -> (string)
                 The name of the dataset import job.

              DataSource -> (structure)
                 The location of the training data to import and an AWS  Iden-
                 tity  and  Access  Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast
                 can assume to access the data.  The  training  data  must  be
                 stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

                 If encryption is used, DataSource includes an AWS Key Manage-
                 ment Service (KMS) key.

                 S3Config -> (structure)
                     The path to the data stored in an Amazon  Simple  Storage
                     Service  (Amazon S3) bucket along with the credentials to
                     access the data.

                     Path -> (string)
                        The path to an Amazon Simple Storage  Service  (Amazon
                        S3) bucket or file(s) in an Amazon S3 bucket.

                     RoleArn -> (string)
                        The  ARN  of  the  AWS  Identity and Access Management
                        (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume  to  access
                        the  Amazon S3 bucket or files. If you provide a value
                        for the KMSKeyArn key, the role must allow  access  to
                        the key.

                        Passing  a role across AWS accounts is not allowed. If
                        you pass a role that isn't in your account, you get an
                        InvalidInputException error.

                     KMSKeyArn -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Key Manage-
                        ment Service (KMS) key.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the dataset import job. States include:

                 o ACTIVE

                 o CREATE_PENDING , CREATE_IN_PROGRESS , CREATE_FAILED

                 o DELETE_PENDING , DELETE_IN_PROGRESS , DELETE_FAILED

                 o CREATE_STOPPING , CREATE_STOPPED

              Message -> (string)
                 If an error occurred, an informational message about the  er-
                 ror.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the dataset import job was created.

              LastModificationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  last  time  the resource was modified. The timestamp de-
                 pends on the status of the job:

                 o CREATE_PENDING - The CreationTime .

                 o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS - The current timestamp.

                 o CREATE_STOPPING - The current timestamp.

                 o CREATE_STOPPED - When the job stopped.

                 o ACTIVE or CREATE_FAILED - When the job finished or failed.

       NextToken -> (string)
