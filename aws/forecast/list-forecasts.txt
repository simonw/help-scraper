LIST-FORECASTS()                                              LIST-FORECASTS()



NAME
       list-forecasts -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of forecasts created using the  CreateForecast opera-
       tion. For each forecast, this operation returns a summary of its  prop-
       erties,  including its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). To retrieve the com-
       plete set of properties, specify the ARN with the  DescribeForecast op-
       eration. You can filter the list using an array of  Filter objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-forecasts  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Forecasts

SYNOPSIS
            list-forecasts
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An array of filters. For each filter, you provide a condition and  a
          match statement. The condition is either IS or IS_NOT , which speci-
          fies whether to include or exclude  the  forecasts  that  match  the
          statement  from the list, respectively. The match statement consists
          of a key and a value.
              Filter properties

          o Condition - The condition to apply. Valid values are IS and IS_NOT
            .  To include the forecasts that match the statement, specify IS .
            To exclude matching forecasts, specify IS_NOT .

          o Key - The name of the parameter to filter  on.  Valid  values  are
            DatasetGroupArn , PredictorArn , and Status .

          o Value - The value to match.

          For  example,  to list all forecasts whose status is not ACTIVE, you
          would specify:
              "Filters": [ { "Condition": "IS_NOT", "Key": "Status",  "Value":
              "ACTIVE" } ]

          (structure)
              Describes a filter for choosing a subset of objects. Each filter
              consists of a condition and a match statement. The condition  is
              either  IS or IS_NOT , which specifies whether to include or ex-
              clude the objects that match the  statement,  respectively.  The
              match statement consists of a key and a value.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the parameter to filter on.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value to match.

              Condition -> (string)
                 The condition to apply. To include the objects that match the
                 statement, specify IS . To exclude matching objects,  specify
                 IS_NOT .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,Condition=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "Condition": "IS"|"IS_NOT"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Forecasts -> (list)
          An array of objects that summarize each forecast's properties.

          (structure)
              Provides a summary of the forecast properties used in the  List-
              Forecasts operation. To get the complete set of properties, call
              the   DescribeForecast  operation,  and  provide the ForecastArn
              that is listed in the summary.

              ForecastArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the forecast.

              ForecastName -> (string)
                 The name of the forecast.

              PredictorArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the predictor used to generate the forecast.

              CreatedUsingAutoPredictor -> (boolean)
                 Whether the Forecast was created from an AutoPredictor.

              DatasetGroupArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset group that pro-
                 vided the data used to train the predictor.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the forecast. States include:

                 o ACTIVE

                 o CREATE_PENDING , CREATE_IN_PROGRESS , CREATE_FAILED

                 o CREATE_STOPPING , CREATE_STOPPED

                 o DELETE_PENDING , DELETE_IN_PROGRESS , DELETE_FAILED

                 NOTE:
                     The  Status of the forecast must be ACTIVE before you can
                     query or export the forecast.

              Message -> (string)
                 If an error occurred, an informational message about the  er-
                 ror.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the forecast creation task was created.

              LastModificationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  last  time  the resource was modified. The timestamp de-
                 pends on the status of the job:

                 o CREATE_PENDING - The CreationTime .

                 o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS - The current timestamp.

                 o CREATE_STOPPING - The current timestamp.

                 o CREATE_STOPPED - When the job stopped.

                 o ACTIVE or CREATE_FAILED - When the job finished or failed.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, Amazon Forecast returns this token. To
          retrieve the next set of results, use the token in the next request.
