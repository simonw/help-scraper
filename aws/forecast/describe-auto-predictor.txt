DESCRIBE-AUTO-PREDICTOR()                            DESCRIBE-AUTO-PREDICTOR()



NAME
       describe-auto-predictor -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes a predictor created using the CreateAutoPredictor operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-auto-predictor
          --predictor-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --predictor-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the predictor.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the predictor

       PredictorName -> (string)
          The name of the predictor.

       ForecastHorizon -> (integer)
          The number of time-steps that the model predicts. The forecast hori-
          zon is also called the prediction length.

       ForecastTypes -> (list)
          The  forecast types used during predictor training. Default value is

          An array of the ARNs of the  dataset  import  jobs  used  to  import
          training data for the predictor.

       DataConfig -> (structure)
          The  data  configuration  for  your dataset group and any additional
          datasets.

          AttributeConfigs -> (list)
              Aggregation and filling options for attributes in  your  dataset
              group.

              (structure)
                 Provides  information  about the method used to transform at-
                 tributes.

                 The following is an example using the RETAIL domain:
                     {

                     "AttributeName": "demand",

                     "Transformations": {"aggregation":  "sum",  "middlefill":
                     "zero", "backfill": "zero"}

                     }

                 AttributeName -> (string)
                     The  name  of  the  attribute as specified in the schema.
                     Amazon Forecast supports the target field of  the  target
                     time series and the related time series datasets. For ex-
                     ample, for the RETAIL domain, the target is demand .

                 Transformations -> (map)
                     The method parameters (key-value pairs), which are a  map
                     of override parameters. Specify these parameters to over-
                     ride the default values. Related Time  Series  attributes
                     do not accept aggregation parameters.

                     The  following  list shows the parameters and their valid
                     values for the "filling" featurization method for a  Tar-
                     get Time Series dataset. Default values are bolded.

                     o aggregation : sum , avg , first , min , max

                     o frontfill : none

                     o middlefill  : zero , nan (not a number), value , median
                       , mean , min , max

                     o backfill : zero , nan , value , median , mean ,  min  ,
                       max

                     The  following  list shows the parameters and their valid
                     values for a Related  Time  Series  featurization  method
                     (there are no defaults):

                     o middlefill : zero , value , median , mean , min , max

                     o backfill : zero , value , median , mean , min , max

                     o futurefill : zero , value , median , mean , min , max

                     To set a filling method to a specific value, set the fill
                     parameter to value and define the value in a  correspond-
                     ing  _value parameter. For example, to set backfilling to
                     a value of 2, include the following: "backfill":  "value"
                     and "backfill_value":"2" .

                 Holidays  is  a  built-in  dataset that incorporates national
                 holiday information into your model. It provides native  sup-
                 port  for  the holiday calendars of 66 countries. To view the
                 holiday calendars, refer to the Jollyday  library.  For  more
