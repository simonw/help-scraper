SYNOPSIS
            describe-predictor
          --predictor-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --predictor-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the predictor that you want infor-
          mation about.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          NOTE:
              The  LatencyOptimized AutoML override strategy is only available
              in private beta. Contact AWS Support or your account manager  to
              learn more about access privileges.

          The AutoML strategy used to train the predictor. Unless LatencyOpti-
          mized is specified, the AutoML strategy  optimizes  predictor  accu-
          racy.

              the value as the number of data points. The default is the value
              of the forecast horizon. BackTestWindowOffset  can  be  used  to
              mimic  a  past  virtual  forecast start date. This value must be
              greater than or equal to the forecast horizon and less than half
              of the TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset length.

                        scale for the hyperparameter.
                            Linear

                        Hyperparameter  tuning  searches the values in the hy-
                        perparameter range by using a linear scale.

              sales across all of your stores, and  your  dataset  contains  a
              store_id  field. If you want the sales forecast for each item by
              store, you would specify store_id as the dimension.

              All forecast  dimensions  specified  in  the  TARGET_TIME_SERIES
              dataset  don't  need  to be specified in the CreatePredictor re-
              quest. All forecast dimensions specified in the RELATED_TIME_SE-
              RIES dataset must be specified in the CreatePredictor request.

                 dataset  field. This object is part of the  FeaturizationCon-
                 fig object.

                 For example:
                     {

                     "AttributeName": "demand",

                     FeaturizationPipeline [ {

                     "FeaturizationMethodName": "filling",

                     "FeaturizationMethodParameters":  {"aggregation":  "avg",
                     "backfill": "nan"}

                 AttributeName -> (string)
                     The  name of the schema attribute that specifies the data
                     field to be featurized. Amazon Forecast supports the tar-
                     get   field   of   the  TARGET_TIME_SERIES  and  the  RE-
                     LATED_TIME_SERIES datasets. For example, for  the  RETAIL
                     domain, the target is demand , and for the CUSTOM domain,
                     the target is target_value . For  more  information,  see

                            eters to override the default values. Related Time
                            Series attributes do not accept aggregation param-
                            eters.

                            The following list shows the parameters and  their
                            valid   values  for  the  "filling"  featurization
                            method for a Target Time Series dataset. Bold sig-
                            nifies the default value.

                            o aggregation : sum , avg , first , min , max

                            valid values for a Related Time Series  featuriza-
                            tion method (there are no defaults):

                            o middlefill  : zero , value , median , mean , min

                            To set a filling method to a specific  value,  set
                            the  fill  parameter to value and define the value
                            in a corresponding _value parameter. For  example,
                            to  set  backfilling  to a value of 2, include the
                            following:   "backfill":   "value"   and    "back-
