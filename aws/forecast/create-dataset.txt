CREATE-DATASET()                                              CREATE-DATASET()



NAME
       create-dataset -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  Amazon Forecast dataset. The information about the dataset
       that you provide helps Forecast understand how to consume the data  for
       model training. This includes the following:

       o

         *
         DataFrequency  * - How frequently your historical time-series data is
         collected.

       System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 23)
         Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

       o

         *
         Domain * and * DatasetType * - Each dataset has an associated dataset
         domain  and a type within the domain. Amazon Forecast provides a list
         of predefined domains and types within each domain. For  each  unique
         dataset  domain  and type within the domain, Amazon Forecast requires
         your data to include a minimum set of predefined fields.

       System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 25)
         Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

       o

         *
         Schema * - A schema specifies the fields in  the  dataset,  including
         the field name and data type.

       System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 27)
         Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

       After creating a dataset, you import your training data into it and add
       the dataset to a dataset group. You use the dataset group to  create  a
       predictor. For more information, see Importing datasets .

       To get a list of all your datasets, use the ListDatasets operation.

       For  example  Forecast  datasets, see the Amazon Forecast Sample GitHub
       repository .

       NOTE:
          The Status of a dataset must be ACTIVE before you can import  train-
          ing data. Use the DescribeDataset operation to get the status.

SYNOPSIS
            create-dataset
          --dataset-name <value>
          --domain <value>
          --dataset-type <value>
          [--data-frequency <value>]
          --schema <value>
          [--encryption-config <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dataset-name (string)
          A name for the dataset.

       --domain (string)
          The  domain associated with the dataset. When you add a dataset to a
          dataset group, this value and the value specified for the Domain pa-
          rameter of the CreateDatasetGroup operation must match.

          The Domain and DatasetType that you choose determine the fields that
          must be present in the training data that you import to the dataset.
          For  example, if you choose the RETAIL domain and TARGET_TIME_SERIES
          as the DatasetType , Amazon Forecast requires item_id , timestamp  ,
          and  demand fields to be present in your data. For more information,
          see Importing datasets .

          Possible values:

          o RETAIL

          o CUSTOM

          o INVENTORY_PLANNING

          o EC2_CAPACITY

          o WORK_FORCE

          o WEB_TRAFFIC

          o METRICS

       --dataset-type (string)
          The dataset type. Valid values depend on the chosen Domain .

          Possible values:

          o TARGET_TIME_SERIES

          o RELATED_TIME_SERIES

          o ITEM_METADATA

       --data-frequency (string)
          The frequency of data collection. This parameter is required for RE-
          LATED_TIME_SERIES datasets.

          Valid  intervals  are  Y  (Year),  M  (Month),  W (Week), D (Day), H
          (Hour), 30min (30 minutes), 15min (15 minutes), 10min (10  minutes),
          5min  (5  minutes),  and 1min (1 minute). For example, "D" indicates
          every day and "15min" indicates every 15 minutes.

       --schema (structure)
          The schema for the dataset. The schema attributes  and  their  order
          must  match the fields in your data. The dataset Domain and Dataset-
          Type that you choose determine the minimum required fields  in  your
          training  data. For information about the required fields for a spe-
          cific dataset domain and type, see Dataset Domains and Dataset Types
          .

          Attributes -> (list)
              An  array  of  attributes  specifying  the name and type of each
              field in a dataset.

              (structure)
                 An attribute of a schema, which defines a  dataset  field.  A
                 schema  attribute  is  required for every field in a dataset.
                 The Schema object contains an array  of  SchemaAttribute  ob-
                 jects.

                 AttributeName -> (string)
                     The name of the dataset field.

                 AttributeType -> (string)
                     The data type of the field.

                     For  a  related  time  series  dataset,  other than date,
                     item_id, and  forecast  dimensions  attributes,  all  at-
                     tributes should be of numerical type (integer/float).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Attributes=[{AttributeName=string,AttributeType=string},{AttributeName=string,AttributeType=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Attributes": [
              {
                "AttributeName": "string",
                "AttributeType": "string"|"integer"|"float"|"timestamp"|"geolocation"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --encryption-config (structure)
          An AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key and the AWS Identity and Ac-
          cess Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access
          the key.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  of the IAM role that Amazon Forecast can assume to ac-
              cess the AWS KMS key.

              Passing a role across AWS accounts is not allowed. If you pass a
              role  that  isn't in your account, you get an InvalidInputExcep-
              tion error.

          KMSKeyArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RoleArn=string,KMSKeyArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RoleArn": "string",
            "KMSKeyArn": "string"
          }

       --tags (list)
          The optional metadata that you apply to the dataset to help you cat-
          egorize  and  organize  them.  Each tag consists of a key and an op-
          tional value, both of which you define.

          The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

          o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

          o For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each  tag  key
            can have only one value.

          o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

          o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

          o If  your  tagging  schema is used across multiple services and re-
            sources, remember that other services may have restrictions on al-
            lowed  characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, num-
            bers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following charac-
            ters: + - = . _ : / @.

          o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

          o Do  not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination of
            such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You  can-
            not edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this
            prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does not,
            then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against
            the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of aws do  not
            count against your tags per resource limit.

          (structure)
              The  optional  metadata that you apply to a resource to help you
              categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and  an
              optional value, both of which you define.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

              o For  each  resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

              o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

              o If your tagging schema is used across  multiple  services  and
                resources,  remember that other services may have restrictions
                on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are:  let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
                lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.

              o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

              o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination
                of  such  as  a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use.
                You cannot edit or delete tag keys with  this  prefix.  Values
                can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but
                the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user  tag
                and  will  count  against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only
                the key prefix of aws do not count against your tags  per  re-
                source limit.

              Key -> (string)
                 One  part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A key is a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  optional part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DatasetArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset.
