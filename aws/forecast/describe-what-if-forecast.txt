OPTIONS
       --what-if-forecast-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the what-if forecast that you are
          interested in.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

          o CREATE_STOPPED - When the job stopped.

          o ACTIVE or CREATE_FAILED - When the job finished or failed.

       TimeSeriesTransformations -> (list)
          An  array  of Action and TimeSeriesConditions elements that describe
          what transformations were applied to which time series.

          (structure)
              A transformation function is a pair of  operations  that  select
              and  modify  the  rows  in a related time series. You select the
              rows that you want with a condition operation and you modify the
              rows  with a transformation operation. All conditions are joined
              with an AND operation, meaning that all conditions must be  true
              for  the  transformation  to be applied. Transformations are ap-
              plied in the order that they are listed.

              Action -> (structure)
                 An array of actions that define a time series and how  it  is
                 transformed.  These  transformations create a new time series
                 that is used for the what-if analysis.

                 AttributeName -> (string)
                     The related time series  that  you  are  modifying.  This
                     value is case insensitive.

                 Operation -> (string)
                     The  operation that is applied to the provided attribute.
                     Operations include:

                     o ADD - adds Value to all rows of AttributeName .

                     o SUBTRACT - subtracts Value from all rows of  Attribute-
                       Name .

                     o MULTIPLY  -  multiplies  all  rows  of AttributeName by
                       Value .

                     o DIVIDE - divides all rows of AttributeName by Value .

                 Value -> (double)
                     The value that is applied for the chosen Operation .

              TimeSeriesConditions -> (list)
                 An array of conditions that define which members of  the  re-
                 lated time series are transformed.

                 (structure)
                     Creates  a  subset  of items within an attribute that are
                     modified. For example, you can use this operation to cre-
                     ate  a  subset of items that cost $5 or less. To do this,
                     you specify "AttributeName": "price" ,  "AttributeValue":
                     "5"  , and "Condition": "LESS_THAN" . Pair this operation
                     with the  Action operation within the   CreateWhatIfFore-
                     castRequest$TimeSeriesTransformations operation to define
                     how the attribute is modified.

                     AttributeName -> (string)
                        The item_id, dimension name,  IM  name,  or  timestamp
                        that you are modifying.

                     AttributeValue -> (string)
                        The value that is applied for the chosen Condition .

                     Condition -> (string)
                        The  condition  to  apply.  Valid  values are EQUALS ,
                        NOT_EQUALS , LESS_THAN and GREATER_THAN .

       TimeSeriesReplacementsDataSource -> (structure)
          An array of S3Config , Schema , and Format  elements  that  describe
          the replacement time series.

          S3Config -> (structure)
              The  path  to  the  file(s)  in an Amazon Simple Storage Service
              (Amazon S3) bucket, and an Identity and Access Management  (IAM)
              role  that Amazon Forecast can assume to access the file(s). Op-
              tionally, includes an Key Management Service (KMS) key. This ob-
              ject  is part of the  DataSource object that is submitted in the
              CreateDatasetImportJob request, and part of the  DataDestination
              object.

              Path -> (string)
                 The  path  to  an  Amazon  Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
                 bucket or file(s) in an Amazon S3 bucket.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that
                 Amazon  Forecast can assume to access the Amazon S3 bucket or
                 files. If you provide a value for the KMSKeyArn key, the role
                 must allow access to the key.

                 Passing a role across Amazon Web Services accounts is not al-
                 lowed. If you pass a role that isn't in your account, you get
                 an InvalidInputException error.

              KMSKeyArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of an Key Management Service
                 (KMS) key.

          Schema -> (structure)
              Defines the fields of a dataset.

              Attributes -> (list)
                 An array of attributes specifying the name and type  of  each
                 field in a dataset.

                 (structure)
                     An  attribute of a schema, which defines a dataset field.
                     A schema attribute is  required  for  every  field  in  a
                     dataset. The Schema object contains an array of SchemaAt-
                     tribute objects.

                     AttributeName -> (string)
                        The name of the dataset field.

                     AttributeType -> (string)
                        The data type of the field.

                        For a related time series dataset,  other  than  date,
                        item_id,  and  forecast dimensions attributes, all at-
                        tributes should be of numerical type (integer/float).

          Format -> (string)
              The format of the replacement data, CSV or PARQUET.

          TimestampFormat -> (string)
              The timestamp format of the replacement data.

       ForecastTypes -> (list)
          The quantiles at which probabilistic forecasts  are  generated.  You
          can  specify  up to five quantiles per what-if forecast in the  Cre-
          ateWhatIfForecast operation. If you didn't  specify  quantiles,  the
          default values are ["0.1", "0.5", "0.9"] .

          (string)
