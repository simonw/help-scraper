CREATE-DATASET-IMPORT-JOB()                        CREATE-DATASET-IMPORT-JOB()



NAME
       create-dataset-import-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Imports  your  training data to an Amazon Forecast dataset. You provide
       the location of your training data in an Amazon Simple Storage  Service
       (Amazon  S3)  bucket  and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset
       that you want to import the data to.

       You must specify a DataSource object that includes an Identity and  Ac-
       cess  Management  (IAM)  role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access
       the data, as Amazon Forecast makes a copy of your data and processes it
       in  an  internal  Amazon Web Services system. For more information, see
       Set up permissions .

       The training data must be in CSV or Parquet format. The delimiter  must
       be a comma (,).

       You  can  specify  the  path to a specific file, the S3 bucket, or to a
       folder in the S3 bucket. For the latter two cases, Amazon Forecast  im-
       ports all files up to the limit of 10,000 files.

       Because  dataset  imports  are not aggregated, your most recent dataset
       import is the one that is used when training a predictor or  generating
       a forecast. Make sure that your most recent dataset import contains all
       of the data you want to model off of, and not just the  new  data  col-
       lected since the previous import.

       To  get  a  list of all your dataset import jobs, filtered by specified
       criteria, use the ListDatasetImportJobs operation.

OPTIONS
       --dataset-import-job-name (string)
          The name for the dataset import job. We recommend including the cur-
          rent  timestamp  in  the  name, for example, 20190721DatasetImport .
          This can help you avoid getting a ResourceAlreadyExistsException ex-
          ception.

       --dataset-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Forecast dataset that
          you want to import data to.

       --data-source (structure)
          The location of the training data to import and an Identity and  Ac-
          cess Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access
          the data. The training data must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

          If encryption is used, DataSource must  include  an  Key  Management
          Service  (KMS)  key and the IAM role must allow Amazon Forecast per-
          mission to access the key. The KMS key and IAM role must match those
          specified in the EncryptionConfig parameter of the CreateDataset op-
          eration.

          S3Config -> (structure)
              The path to the data stored in an Amazon Simple Storage  Service
              (Amazon  S3)  bucket  along  with  the credentials to access the
              data.

              Path -> (string)
                 The path to an Amazon  Simple  Storage  Service  (Amazon  S3)
                 bucket or file(s) in an Amazon S3 bucket.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that
                 Amazon Forecast can assume to access the Amazon S3 bucket  or
                 files. If you provide a value for the KMSKeyArn key, the role
                 must allow access to the key.

                 Passing a role across Amazon Web Services accounts is not al-
                 lowed. If you pass a role that isn't in your account, you get
                 an InvalidInputException error.

              KMSKeyArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Key  Management  Service
                 (KMS) key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Config={Path=string,RoleArn=string,KMSKeyArn=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Config": {
              "Path": "string",
              "RoleArn": "string",
              "KMSKeyArn": "string"
            }
          }

       --timestamp-format (string)
          The format of timestamps in the dataset. The format that you specify
          depends on the DataFrequency specified when the dataset was created.
          The following formats are supported

          o "yyyy-MM-dd" For the following data frequencies: Y, M, W, and D

          o "yyyy-MM-dd  HH:mm:ss"  For  the  following  data  frequencies: H,
            30min, 15min, and 1min; and optionally, for: Y, M, W, and D

          If the format isn't specified, Amazon Forecast expects the format to
          be "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss".

       --time-zone (string)
          A  single  time  zone for every item in your dataset. This option is
          ideal for datasets with all timestamps within a single time zone, or
          if all timestamps are normalized to a single time zone.

          Refer  to  the  Joda-Time API for a complete list of valid time zone
          names.

       --use-geolocation-for-time-zone  |   --no-use-geolocation-for-time-zone
       (boolean)
          Automatically  derive time zone information from the geolocation at-
          tribute. This option is ideal for datasets that  contain  timestamps
          in  multiple  time zones and those timestamps are expressed in local
          time.

       --geolocation-format (string)
          The format of the geolocation attribute. The  geolocation  attribute
          can be formatted in one of two ways:

          o LAT_LONG - the latitude and longitude in decimal format (Example:
            47.61_
            -122.33).

          o CC_POSTALCODE  (US  Only) - the country code (US), followed by the
            5-digit ZIP code (Example: US_98121).

       --tags (list)
          The optional metadata that you apply to the dataset  import  job  to
          help  you  categorize  and organize them. Each tag consists of a key
          and an optional value, both of which you define.

          The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

          o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

          o For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each  tag  key
            can have only one value.

          o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

          o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

          o If  your  tagging  schema is used across multiple services and re-
            sources, remember that other services may have restrictions on al-
            lowed  characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, num-
            bers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following charac-
            ters: + - = . _ : / @.

          o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

          o Do  not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination of
            such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for  Amazon  Web  Ser-
            vices  use.  You  cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix.
            Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its  prefix
            but  the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag
            and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags  with  only  the
            key  prefix  of  aws  do  not count against your tags per resource
            limit.

          (structure)
              The optional metadata that you apply to a resource to  help  you
              categorize  and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an
              optional value, both of which you define.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

              o For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and  each  tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

              o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

              o If  your  tagging  schema is used across multiple services and
                resources, remember that other services may have  restrictions
                on  allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
                lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.

              o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

              o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination
                of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for Amazon  Web
                Services  use.  You  cannot  edit or delete tag keys with this
                prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as
                its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to
                be a user tag and will count against the  limit  of  50  tags.
                Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not count against your
                tags per resource limit.

              Key -> (string)
                 One part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A key is  a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag.  A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --format (string)
          The  format  of the imported data, CSV or PARQUET. The default value
          is CSV.

       --import-mode (string)
          Specifies whether the dataset import job is a  FULL  or  INCREMENTAL
          import. A FULL dataset import replaces all of the existing data with
          the newly imported data. An INCREMENTAL import appends the  imported
          data to the existing data.

          Possible values:

          o FULL

          o INCREMENTAL

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
