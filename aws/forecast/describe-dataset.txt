DESCRIBE-DATASET()                                          DESCRIBE-DATASET()



NAME
       describe-dataset -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  an  Amazon Forecast dataset created using the  CreateDataset
       operation.

       In addition to listing the parameters specified  in  the  CreateDataset
       request, this operation includes the following dataset properties:

       o CreationTime

       o LastModificationTime

       o Status

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-dataset
          --dataset-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dataset-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DatasetArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset.

       DatasetName -> (string)
          The name of the dataset.

       Domain -> (string)
          The domain associated with the dataset.

       DatasetType -> (string)
          The dataset type.

       DataFrequency -> (string)
          The frequency of data collection.

          Valid  intervals  are  Y  (Year),  M  (Month),  W (Week), D (Day), H
          (Hour), 30min (30 minutes), 15min (15 minutes), 10min (10  minutes),
          5min  (5  minutes),  and 1min (1 minute). For example, "M" indicates
          every month and "30min" indicates every 30 minutes.

       Schema -> (structure)
          An array of SchemaAttribute objects that specify the dataset fields.
          Each SchemaAttribute specifies the name and data type of a field.

          Attributes -> (list)
              An  array  of  attributes  specifying  the name and type of each
              field in a dataset.

              (structure)
                 An attribute of a schema, which defines a  dataset  field.  A
                 schema  attribute  is  required for every field in a dataset.
                 The  Schema object contains an array of  SchemaAttribute  ob-
                 jects.

                 AttributeName -> (string)
                     The name of the dataset field.

                 AttributeType -> (string)
                     The data type of the field.

       EncryptionConfig -> (structure)
          The  AWS  Key  Management Service (KMS) key and the AWS Identity and
          Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to  ac-
          cess the key.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  of the IAM role that Amazon Forecast can assume to ac-
              cess the AWS KMS key.

              Passing a role across AWS accounts is not allowed. If you pass a
              role  that  isn't in your account, you get an InvalidInputExcep-
              tion error.

          KMSKeyArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the dataset. States include:

          o ACTIVE

          o CREATE_PENDING , CREATE_IN_PROGRESS , CREATE_FAILED

          o DELETE_PENDING , DELETE_IN_PROGRESS , DELETE_FAILED

          o UPDATE_PENDING , UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS , UPDATE_FAILED

          The UPDATE states apply while data is imported to the dataset from a
          call to the  CreateDatasetImportJob operation and reflect the status
          of the dataset import job. For example, when the import  job  status
          is   CREATE_IN_PROGRESS   ,   the  status  of  the  dataset  is  UP-
          DATE_IN_PROGRESS .

          NOTE:
              The Status of the dataset must be ACTIVE before you  can  import
              training data.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          When the dataset was created.

       LastModificationTime -> (timestamp)
          When  you create a dataset, LastModificationTime is the same as Cre-
          ationTime . While data is being imported to the dataset, LastModifi-
          cationTime  is the current time of the DescribeDataset call. After a
          CreateDatasetImportJob operation has finished,  LastModificationTime
          is when the import job completed or failed.
