GET-STREAM()                                                      GET-STREAM()



NAME
       get-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about the active (live) stream on a specified channel.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-stream
          --channel-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-arn (string)
          Channel ARN for stream to be accessed.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about a stream

       The  following get-stream example gets information about the stream for
       the specified channel.

          aws ivs get-stream \
              --channel-arn arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh

       Output:

          {
              "stream": {
                  "channelArn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh",
                  "playbackUrl": "https://a1b2c3d4e5f6.us-west-2.playback.live-video.net/api/video/v1/us-west-2.123456789012.channel.abcdEFGH.m3u8",
                  "startTime": "2020-05-05T21:55:38Z",
                  "state": "LIVE",
                  "health": "HEALTHY",
                  "streamID": "st-ABCDEfghij01234KLMN5678",
                  "viewerCount": 1
              }
          }

       Video Service User Guide.

OUTPUT
       stream -> (structure)
          channelArn -> (string)
              Channel ARN for the stream.

          health -> (string)
              The streams health.

          playbackUrl -> (string)
              URL of the master playlist, required by the video player to play
              the HLS stream.

          startTime -> (timestamp)
              Time of the streams start. This is an  ISO  8601  timestamp  re-
              turned as a string.

          state -> (string)
              The streams state.

          streamId -> (string)
              Unique  identifier  for  a live or previously live stream in the
              specified channel.

          viewerCount -> (long)
              A count of concurrent views of the stream. Typically, a new view
              appears  in viewerCount within 15 seconds of when video playback
              starts and a view is removed from viewerCount within 1 minute of
              when  video  playback ends. A value of -1 indicates that the re-
              quest timed out; in this case, retry.
