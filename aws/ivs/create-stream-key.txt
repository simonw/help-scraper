CREATE-STREAM-KEY()                                        CREATE-STREAM-KEY()



NAME
       create-stream-key -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  stream  key,  used  to initiate a stream, for the specified
       channel ARN.

       Note that  CreateChannel creates a stream key. If you subsequently  use
       CreateStreamKey  on the same channel, it will fail because a stream key
       already exists and there is a limit of 1 stream key per channel. To re-
       set  the  stream key on a channel, use  DeleteStreamKey and then Creat-
       eStreamKey.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-stream-key
          --channel-arn <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-arn (string)
          ARN of the channel for which to create the stream key.

       --tags (map)
          Array of 1-50 maps, each of the form string:string (key:value) .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a stream key

       The following create-stream-key example creates  a  stream  key  for  a
       specified ARN (Amazon Resource Name).

          aws ivs create-stream-key \
              --channel-arn arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh

       Output:

          {
              "streamKey": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:stream-key/abcdABCDefgh",
                  "value": "sk_us-west-2_abcdABCDefgh_567890abcdef",
                  "channelArn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh",
                  "tags": {}
              }
          }

       Video Service User Guide.

OUTPUT
       streamKey -> (structure)
          Stream key used to authenticate an RTMPS stream for ingestion.

          arn -> (string)
              Stream-key ARN.

          channelArn -> (string)
              Channel ARN for the stream.

          tags -> (map)
              Array of 1-50 maps, each of the form string:string (key:value) .

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          value -> (string)
              Stream-key value.
