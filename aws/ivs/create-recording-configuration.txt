CREATE-RECORDING-CONFIGURATION()              CREATE-RECORDING-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       create-recording-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new recording configuration, used to enable recording to Ama-
       zon S3.
          Known issue: In the us-east-1 region, if you use the Amazon Web Ser-
          vices  CLI  to  create a recording configuration, it returns success
          even if the S3 bucket is in a different region. In  this  case,  the
          state  of  the  recording configuration is CREATE_FAILED (instead of
          ACTIVE ). (In other regions, the CLI correctly  returns  failure  if
          the bucket is in a different region.)

          Workaround:  Ensure that your S3 bucket is in the same region as the
          recording configuration. If you create a recording configuration  in
          a different region as your S3 bucket, delete that recording configu-
          ration and create a new one with an S3 bucket from the  correct  re-
          gion.

OPTIONS
       --destination-configuration (structure)
          A  complex  type that contains a destination configuration for where
          recorded video will be stored.

          s3 -> (structure)
              An S3 destination configuration where recorded  videos  will  be
              stored.

              bucketName -> (string)
                 Location  (S3  bucket  name)  where  recorded  videos will be
                 stored.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          s3={bucketName=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "s3": {
              "bucketName": "string"
            }
          }

       --name (string)
          Recording-configuration name. The value does not need to be unique.

       --recording-reconnect-window-seconds (integer)
          If a broadcast disconnects and then reconnects within the  specified
          interval, the multiple streams will be considered a single broadcast
          and merged together. Default: 0.

       --rendition-configuration (structure)
          Object that describes which renditions  should  be  recorded  for  a
          stream.

          renditionSelection -> (string)
              Indicates which set of renditions are recorded for a stream. For
              BASIC channels, the CUSTOM value has no  effect.  If  CUSTOM  is
              specified,  a  set of renditions must be specified in the rendi-
              tions field. Default: ALL .

          renditions -> (list)
              Indicates which renditions are recorded for a stream, if  rendi-
              tionSelection  is  CUSTOM ; otherwise, this field is irrelevant.
              The selected renditions are recorded if they are available  dur-
              ing the stream. If a selected rendition is unavailable, the best
              available rendition is recorded. For details on  the  resolution
              dimensions of each rendition, see Auto-Record to Amazon S3 .

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          renditionSelection=string,renditions=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "renditionSelection": "ALL"|"NONE"|"CUSTOM",
            "renditions": ["SD"|"HD"|"FULL_HD"|"LOWEST_RESOLUTION", ...]
          }

       --tags (map)
          Array of 1-50 maps, each of the form string:string (key:value) . See
          Best practices and strategies in Tagging  Amazon  Web  Services  Re-
          sources  and Tag Editor for details, including restrictions that ap-
          ply to tags and "Tag naming limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS has
          no service-specific constraints beyond what is documented there.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --thumbnail-configuration (structure)
          A  complex  type  that allows you to enable/disable the recording of
          thumbnails for a live session  and  modify  the  interval  at  which
          thumbnails are generated for the live session.

          recordingMode -> (string)
              Thumbnail recording mode. Default: INTERVAL .

          resolution -> (string)
              Indicates  the desired resolution of recorded thumbnails. Thumb-
              nails are recorded at the selected resolution if the correspond-
              ing  rendition  is  available during the stream; otherwise, they
              are recorded at source resolution. For  more  information  about
              resolution  values  and their corresponding height and width di-
              mensions, see Auto-Record to Amazon S3 . Default:  Null  (source
              resolution is returned).

          storage -> (list)
              Indicates  the  format in which thumbnails are recorded. SEQUEN-
              TIAL records all generated thumbnails in a serial manner, to the
              media/thumbnails directory. LATEST saves the latest thumbnail in
              media/latest_thumbnail/thumb.jpg and overwrites it at the inter-
              val specified by targetIntervalSeconds . You can enable both SE-
              QUENTIAL and LATEST . Default: SEQUENTIAL .

              (string)

          targetIntervalSeconds -> (long)
              The targeted thumbnail-generation interval in seconds.  This  is
              configurable  (and required) only if recordingMode is INTERVAL .
              Default: 60.
                 Important: For the BASIC channel type, setting  a  value  for
                 targetIntervalSeconds  does not guarantee that thumbnails are
                 generated at the specified interval.  For  thumbnails  to  be
                 generated   at   the   targetIntervalSeconds   interval,  the
                 IDR/Keyframe value for the input video must be less than  the
                 targetIntervalSeconds value. See Amazon IVS Streaming Config-
                 uration for information on setting IDR/Keyframe to the recom-
                 mended value in video-encoder settings.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          recordingMode=string,resolution=string,storage=string,string,targetIntervalSeconds=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "recordingMode": "DISABLED"|"INTERVAL",
            "resolution": "SD"|"HD"|"FULL_HD"|"LOWEST_RESOLUTION",
            "storage": ["SEQUENTIAL"|"LATEST", ...],
            "targetIntervalSeconds": long
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a RecordingConfiguration resource

       The following create-recording-configuration example creates a  Record-
       ingConfiguration resource to enable recording to Amazon S3.

          aws ivs create-recording-configuration \
              --name "test-recording-config" \
              --recording-reconnect-window-seconds 60 \

OUTPUT
       recordingConfiguration -> (structure)
          arn -> (string)
              Recording-configuration ARN.

          destinationConfiguration -> (structure)
              A complex type that contains information  about  where  recorded
              video will be stored.

              s3 -> (structure)
                 An S3 destination configuration where recorded videos will be
                 stored.

                 bucketName -> (string)
                     Location (S3 bucket name) where recorded videos  will  be
                     stored.

          name -> (string)
              Recording-configuration  name.  The  value  does  not need to be
              unique.

          recordingReconnectWindowSeconds -> (integer)
              If a broadcast disconnects and then reconnects within the speci-
              fied  interval, the multiple streams will be considered a single
              broadcast and merged together. Default: 0.

          renditionConfiguration -> (structure)
              Object that describes which renditions should be recorded for  a
              stream.

              renditionSelection -> (string)
                 Indicates  which set of renditions are recorded for a stream.
                 For BASIC channels, the CUSTOM value has no effect. If CUSTOM
                 is  specified,  a  set of renditions must be specified in the
                 renditions field. Default: ALL .

              renditions -> (list)
                 Indicates which renditions are recorded for a stream, if ren-
                 ditionSelection  is CUSTOM ; otherwise, this field is irrele-
                 vant. The selected renditions are recorded if they are avail-
                 able  during  the stream. If a selected rendition is unavail-
                 able, the best available rendition is recorded.  For  details
                 on   the   resolution   dimensions  of  each  rendition,  see
                 Auto-Record to Amazon S3 .

                 (string)

          state -> (string)
              Indicates the current state of the recording configuration. When
              the state is ACTIVE , the configuration is ready for recording a
              channel stream.

          tags -> (map)
              Tags attached to the resource. Array of 1-50 maps, each  of  the
              form  string:string (key:value) . See Best practices and strate-
              gies in Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources and Tag Editor for
              details, including restrictions that apply to tags and "Tag nam-
              ing limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS has no service-specific
              constraints beyond what is documented there.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          thumbnailConfiguration -> (structure)
              A  complex  type that allows you to enable/disable the recording
              of thumbnails for a live session  and  modify  the  interval  at
              which thumbnails are generated for the live session.

              recordingMode -> (string)
                 Thumbnail recording mode. Default: INTERVAL .

              resolution -> (string)
                 Indicates  the  desired  resolution  of  recorded thumbnails.
                 Thumbnails are recorded at the  selected  resolution  if  the
                 corresponding  rendition is available during the stream; oth-
                 erwise, they are recorded at source resolution. For more  in-
                 formation  about  resolution  values  and their corresponding
                 height and width dimensions, see Auto-Record to Amazon  S3  .
                 Default: Null (source resolution is returned).

              storage -> (list)
                 Indicates  the  format  in which thumbnails are recorded. SE-
                 QUENTIAL records all generated thumbnails in a serial manner,
                 to  the  media/thumbnails  directory. LATEST saves the latest
                 thumbnail in media/latest_thumbnail/thumb.jpg and  overwrites
                 it  at  the interval specified by targetIntervalSeconds . You
                 can enable both SEQUENTIAL and LATEST . Default: SEQUENTIAL .

                 (string)

              targetIntervalSeconds -> (long)
                 The targeted thumbnail-generation interval in  seconds.  This
                 is  configurable  (and required) only if recordingMode is IN-
                 TERVAL . Default: 60.
                     Important: For the BASIC channel type,  setting  a  value
                     for  targetIntervalSeconds does not guarantee that thumb-
                     nails are generated at the specified interval. For thumb-
                     nails to be generated at the targetIntervalSeconds inter-
                     val, the IDR/Keyframe value for the input video  must  be
                     less than the targetIntervalSeconds value. See Amazon IVS
                     Streaming  Configuration  for  information   on   setting
                     IDR/Keyframe  to  the  recommended value in video-encoder
                     settings.
