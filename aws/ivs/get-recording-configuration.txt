GET-RECORDING-CONFIGURATION()                    GET-RECORDING-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       get-recording-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the recording configuration for the specified ARN.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-recording-configuration
          --arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          ARN of the recording configuration to be retrieved.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about a RecordingConfiguration resource

       The  following  get-recording-configuration  example  gets  information
       about the RecordingConfiguration resource for the specified ARN.

          aws ivs get-recording-configuration \
              --arn "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:recording-configuration/ABcdef34ghIJ"

       Output:

          {
              "recordingConfiguration": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:recording-configuration/ABcdef34ghIJ",
                  "name": "test-recording-config",
                  "destinationConfiguration": {
                      "s3": {
                          "bucketName": "demo-recording-bucket"
                      }
                  },
                  "state": "ACTIVE",
                  "tags": { "key1" : "value1" },
                  "thumbnailConfiguration": {
                      "recordingMode": "INTERVAL",
                      "targetIntervalSeconds": 30
                  }
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       recordingConfiguration -> (structure)
          arn -> (string)
              Recording-configuration ARN.

          destinationConfiguration -> (structure)
              A  complex  type  that contains information about where recorded
              video will be stored.

              s3 -> (structure)
                 An S3 destination configuration where recorded videos will be
                 stored.

                 bucketName -> (string)
                     Location  (S3  bucket name) where recorded videos will be
                     stored.

          name -> (string)
              Recording-configuration name. The value  does  not  need  to  be
              unique.

          state -> (string)
              Indicates the current state of the recording configuration. When
              the state is ACTIVE , the configuration is ready for recording a
              channel stream.

          tags -> (map)
              Array of 1-50 maps, each of the form string:string (key:value) .

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          thumbnailConfiguration -> (structure)
              A  complex  type that allows you to enable/disable the recording
              of thumbnails for a live session  and  modify  the  interval  at
              which thumbnails are generated for the live session.

              recordingMode -> (string)
                 Thumbnail recording mode. Default: INTERVAL .

              targetIntervalSeconds -> (long)
                 The  targeted  thumbnail-generation interval in seconds. This
                 is configurable (and required) only if recordingMode  is  IN-
                 TERVAL . Default: 60.
                     Important: Setting a value for targetIntervalSeconds does
                     not guarantee that thumbnails are generated at the speci-
                     fied interval. For thumbnails to be generated at the tar-
                     getIntervalSeconds interval, the IDR/Keyframe  value  for
                     the  input video must be less than the targetIntervalSec-
                     onds value. See Amazon IVS  Streaming  Configuration  for
                     information  on  setting  IDR/Keyframe to the recommended
                     value in video-encoder settings.
