DELETE-CHANNEL()                                              DELETE-CHANNEL()



NAME
       delete-channel -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the specified channel and its associated stream keys.

       If  you  try  to delete a live channel, you will get an error (409 Con-
       flictException). To delete a channel that is live, call   StopStream  ,
       wait  for the Amazon EventBridge "Stream End" event (to verify that the
       stream's state was changed from Live to Offline), then call DeleteChan-
       nel. (See Using EventBridge with Amazon IVS .)

SYNOPSIS
            delete-channel
          --arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          ARN of the channel to be deleted.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
