       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-channel
          [--authorized | --no-authorized]
          [--latency-mode <value>]
          [--name <value>]
          [--recording-configuration-arn <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --authorized | --no-authorized (boolean)
          Whether the channel is private (enabled for playback authorization).
          Default: false .

       --latency-mode (string)
          Channel latency mode. Use NORMAL to broadcast and deliver live video
          up  to Full HD. Use LOW for near-real-time interaction with viewers.
          (Note: In the Amazon IVS console, LOW and NORMAL correspond  to  Ul-
          tra-low and Standard, respectively.) Default: LOW .

          Possible values:

          o NORMAL

          o LOW

       --name (string)
          Channel name.

       --recording-configuration-arn (string)
          Recording-configuration ARN. Default: "" (empty string, recording is
          disabled).

       --tags (map)
          Array of 1-50 maps, each of the form string:string (key:value) .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --type (string)
          Channel type, which determines the allowable resolution and bitrate.
          If you exceed the allowable resolution or bitrate, the stream proba-
          bly will disconnect immediately. Default: STANDARD . Valid values:

          o STANDARD : Multiple qualities are generated from the original  in-
            put,  to  automatically give viewers the best experience for their
            devices and network conditions. Resolution can be up to 1080p  and
            bitrate can be up to 8.5 Mbps. Audio is transcoded only for rendi-
            tions 360p and below; above that, audio is passed through.

          o BASIC : Amazon IVS delivers the original  input  to  viewers.  The
            viewers  video-quality  choice  is  limited to the original input.
            Resolution can be up to 480p and bitrate can be up to 1.5 Mbps.

          Possible values:

          o BASIC

          o STANDARD

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To create a channel with no recording

       The following create-channel example creates a new channel and an asso-
       ciated stream key to start streaming.

          aws ivs create-channel \
              -name "test-channel"

       Output:

          {
              "channel": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh",
                  "name": "test-channel",
                  "latencyMode": "LOW",
                  "recordingConfigurationArn": "",
                  "ingestEndpoint": "a1b2c3d4e5f6.global-contribute.live-video.net",
                  "playbackUrl": "https://a1b2c3d4e5f6.us-west-2.playback.live-video.net/api/video/v1/us-west-2.123456789012.channel.abcdEFGH.m3u8",
                  "tags": {}
              },
              "streamKey": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:stream-key/g1H2I3j4k5L6",
                  "value": "sk_us-west-2_abcdABCDefgh_567890abcdef",
                  "channelArn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh",
                  "tags": {}
              }
          }

       Video Service User Guide.

       Example 2: To create  a  channel  with  recording  enabled,  using  the
       RecordingConfiguration resource specified by its ARN

       The following create-channel example creates a new channel and an asso-
       ciated stream key to start streaming, and sets  up  recording  for  the
       channel.

          aws ivs create-channel \
              --name test-channel-with-recording \
              --recording-configuration-arn "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:recording-configuration/ABCD12cdEFgh"

       Output:

          {
              "channel": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh",
                  "name": "test-channel-with-recording",
                  "latencyMode": "LOW",
                  "type": "STANDARD",
                  "recordingConfigurationArn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:recording-configuration/ABCD12cdEFgh",
                  "ingestEndpoint": "a1b2c3d4e5f6.global-contribute.live-video.net",
                  "playbackUrl": "https://a1b2c3d4e5f6.us-west-2.playback.live-video.net/api/video/v1/us-west-2.123456789012.channel.abcdEFGH.m3u8",
                  "authorized": false,
                  "tags": {}
              },
              "streamKey": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:stream-key/abcdABCDefgh",
                  "value": "sk_us-west-2_abcdABCDefgh_567890abcdef",
                  "channelArn": "arn:aws:ivs:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/abcdABCDefgh",
                  "tags": {}
              }
          }
