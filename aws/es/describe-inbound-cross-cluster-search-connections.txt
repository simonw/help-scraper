       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-inbound-cross-cluster-search-connections
          [--filters <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          A list of filters used to match properties for inbound cross-cluster
          search  connection.  Available  `` Filter`` names for this operation
          are:

          o cross-cluster-search-connection-id

          o source-domain-info.domain-name

          o source-domain-info.owner-id

          o source-domain-info.region

          o destination-domain-info.domain-name

          (structure)
              A filter used to limit results when describing inbound  or  out-
              bound  cross-cluster  search connections. Multiple values can be
              specified per filter. A  cross-cluster  search  connection  must
              match at least one of the specified values for it to be returned
              from an operation.

              Name -> (string)
                 Specifies the name of the filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 Contains one or more values for the filter.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          Set this value to limit the number of results returned. If not spec-
          ified, defaults to 100.

       --next-token (string)
          NextToken  is  sent in case the earlier API call results contain the
          NextToken. It is used for pagination.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CrossClusterSearchConnections -> (list)
          Consists of list of `` InboundCrossClusterSearchConnection``  match-
          ing the specified filter criteria.

          (structure)
              Specifies details of an inbound connection.

              SourceDomainInfo -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the `` DomainInformation`` for the source Elastic-

                 DomainName -> (string)
                     The  name  of  an  Elasticsearch domain. Domain names are

              CrossClusterSearchConnectionId -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  connection  id  for the inbound cross-cluster
                 search connection.

              ConnectionStatus -> (structure)
                 Specifies the ``  InboundCrossClusterSearchConnectionStatus``
                 for the outbound connection.

                 StatusCode -> (string)
                     The state code for inbound connection. This can be one of
                     the following:

                     o PENDING_ACCEPTANCE: Inbound connection is not  yet  ac-
                       cepted by destination domain owner.

                     o APPROVED:  Inbound  connection is pending acceptance by
                       destination domain owner.

                     o REJECTING: Inbound connection rejection is in process.

                     o REJECTED: Inbound connection is rejected.

                     o DELETING: Inbound connection deletion is in progress.

                     o DELETED: Inbound connection is deleted  and  cannot  be
                       used further.

                 Message -> (string)
                     Specifies  verbose information for the inbound connection
                     status.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If more results are available and NextToken  is  present,  make  the
          next request to the same API with the received NextToken to paginate
          the remaining results.
