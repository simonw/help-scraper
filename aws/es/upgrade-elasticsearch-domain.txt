       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            upgrade-elasticsearch-domain
          --domain-name <value>
          --target-version <value>
          [--perform-check-only | --no-perform-check-only]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The name of an Elasticsearch domain. Domain names are unique  across
          the  domains  owned by an account within an AWS region. Domain names
          start with a letter or number and can contain the following  charac-
          ters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

       --target-version (string)
          The  version  of Elasticsearch that you intend to upgrade the domain
          to.

       --perform-check-only | --no-perform-check-only (boolean)
          This flag, when set to True, indicates that an  Upgrade  Eligibility
          Check  needs to be performed. This will not actually perform the Up-
          grade.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DomainName -> (string)
          The name of an Elasticsearch domain. Domain names are unique  across
          the  domains  owned by an account within an AWS region. Domain names
          start with a letter or number and can contain the following  charac-
          ters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

       TargetVersion -> (string)
          The  version  of Elasticsearch that you intend to upgrade the domain
          to.

       PerformCheckOnly -> (boolean)
          This flag, when set to True, indicates that an  Upgrade  Eligibility
          Check  needs to be performed. This will not actually perform the Up-
          grade.
