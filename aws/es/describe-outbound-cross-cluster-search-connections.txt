       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-outbound-cross-cluster-search-connections
          [--filters <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          A list of filters used to match properties for outbound  cross-clus-
          ter  search  connection. Available `` Filter`` names for this opera-
          tion are:

          o cross-cluster-search-connection-id

          o destination-domain-info.domain-name

          o destination-domain-info.owner-id

          o destination-domain-info.region

          o source-domain-info.domain-name

          (structure)
              A filter used to limit results when describing inbound  or  out-
              bound  cross-cluster  search connections. Multiple values can be
              specified per filter. A  cross-cluster  search  connection  must
              match at least one of the specified values for it to be returned
              from an operation.

              Name -> (string)
                 Specifies the name of the filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 Contains one or more values for the filter.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          Set this value to limit the number of results returned. If not spec-
          ified, defaults to 100.

       --next-token (string)
          NextToken  is  sent in case the earlier API call results contain the
          NextToken. It is used for pagination.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     o VALIDATION_FAILED: Validation failed for the connection
                       request.

                     o PENDING_ACCEPTANCE: Outbound connection request is val-
                       idated and is not yet accepted  by  destination  domain
                       owner.
