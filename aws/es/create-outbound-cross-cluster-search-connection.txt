SYNOPSIS
            create-outbound-cross-cluster-search-connection
          --source-domain-info <value>
          --destination-domain-info <value>

OPTIONS
       --source-domain-info (structure)
          Specifies the `` DomainInformation`` for  the  source  Elasticsearch
          domain.

          OwnerId -> (string)

          DomainName -> (string)
              The  name  of  an  Elasticsearch domain. Domain names are unique
              across the domains owned by an account within an AWS region. Do-
              main  names  start  with  a letter or number and can contain the
              following characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

          Region -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          OwnerId=string,DomainName=string,Region=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "OwnerId": "string",
            "DomainName": "string",
            "Region": "string"
          }

       --destination-domain-info (structure)
          Specifies the `` DomainInformation`` for  the  destination  Elastic-
          search domain.

          OwnerId -> (string)

          DomainName -> (string)
              The  name  of  an  Elasticsearch domain. Domain names are unique
              across the domains owned by an account within an AWS region. Do-
              main  names  start  with  a letter or number and can contain the
              following characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

          Region -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          OwnerId=string,DomainName=string,Region=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "OwnerId": "string",
            "DomainName": "string",
            "Region": "string"
          }

       --connection-alias (string)
          Specifies the connection alias that will be used by the customer for
          this connection.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
