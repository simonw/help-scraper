NAME
       describe-elasticsearch-instance-type-limits -

DESCRIPTION
       Describe  Elasticsearch  Limits  for  a given InstanceType and Elastic-
       searchVersion. When modifying existing Domain, specify the ``   Domain-
       Name `` to know what Limits are supported for modifying.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-elasticsearch-instance-type-limits
          [--domain-name <value>]
          --instance-type <value>
          --elasticsearch-version <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          DomainName  represents  the name of the Domain that we are trying to
          modify. This should be present only if we are querying for  Elastic-
          search ``  Limits `` for existing domain.

       --instance-type (string)
          The  instance  type  for an Elasticsearch cluster for which Elastic-
          search ``  Limits `` are needed.

       --elasticsearch-version (string)
          Version of Elasticsearch for which ``  Limits `` are needed.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
