DESCRIPTION
       Amazon EventBridge helps you to respond to state changes in your Amazon
       Web Services resources. When your resources change state, they automat-
       ically  send events to an event stream. You can create rules that match
       selected events in the stream and route them to targets to take action.
       You  can also use rules to take action on a predetermined schedule. For
       example, you can configure rules to:

       o Automatically invoke an Lambda function to update DNS entries when an
         event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance enters the running state.

       o Direct specific API records from CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis data
         stream for detailed analysis of potential  security  or  availability
         risks.

       o Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Ama-
         zon EBS volume.

       For more information about the features of Amazon EventBridge, see  the
       Amazon EventBridge User Guide .
