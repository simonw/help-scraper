DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides simple, scalable file
       storage for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the  Amazon  Web  Services
       Cloud.  With  Amazon  EFS,  storage  capacity  is  elastic, growing and
       shrinking automatically as you add and remove files, so  your  applica-
       tions  have the storage they need, when they need it. For more informa-
       tion, see the Amazon Elastic File System API Reference and  the  Amazon
       Elastic File System User Guide .
