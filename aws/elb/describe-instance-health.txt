DESCRIBE-INSTANCE-HEALTH()                          DESCRIBE-INSTANCE-HEALTH()



NAME
       describe-instance-health -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  state  of  the  specified instances with respect to the
       specified load balancer. If no instances are specified,  the  call  de-
       scribes  the  state of all instances that are currently registered with
       the load balancer. If instances are specified, their state is  returned
       even if they are no longer registered with the load balancer. The state
       of terminated instances is not returned.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-instance-health
          --load-balancer-name <value>
          [--instances <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-name (string)
          The name of the load balancer.

       --instances (list)
          The IDs of the instances.

          (structure)
              The ID of an EC2 instance.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The instance ID.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          --instances InstanceId1 InstanceId2 InstanceId3

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "InstanceId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       This example describes the health of the instances  for  the  specified
       load balancer.

                }
            ]
          }

       To describe the health of an instance for a load balancer

       This  example  describes  the  health of the specified instance for the
       specified load balancer.

       Command:

          aws elb describe-instance-health --load-balancer-name my-load-balancer --instances i-7299c809

       The following is an example response for an instance that is  register-
       ing.

       Output:

          {
            "InstanceStates": [
                {
