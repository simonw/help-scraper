DESCRIBE-LOAD-BALANCERS()                            DESCRIBE-LOAD-BALANCERS()



NAME
       describe-load-balancers -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  specified  the load balancers. If no load balancers are
       specified, the call describes all of your load balancers.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-load-balancers is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: LoadBalancerDescriptions

SYNOPSIS
            describe-load-balancers
          [--load-balancer-names <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-names (list)
          The names of the load balancers.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

                        Protocol -> (string)
                            The  load  balancer  transport protocol to use for
                            routing: HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, or SSL.

                        LoadBalancerPort -> (integer)
                            The port on which the load balancer is  listening.
                            On  EC2-VPC,  you  can  specify  any port from the
                            range 1-65535. On EC2-Classic, you can specify any
                            port  from  the  following list: 25, 80, 443, 465,
                            587, 1024-65535.

                        InstanceProtocol -> (string)
                            The protocol to use for  routing  traffic  to  in-
                            stances: HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, or SSL.

                            If  the  front-end  protocol  is  TCP  or SSL, the
                            back-end protocol must  be  TCP  or  SSL.  If  the
                            front-end  protocol is HTTP or HTTPS, the back-end
                            protocol must be HTTP or HTTPS.

                            If there is another listener with the same Instan-
                            cePort whose InstanceProtocol is secure, (HTTPS or
                            SSL), the listener's InstanceProtocol must also be
                            secure.

                            If there is another listener with the same Instan-
                            cePort whose InstanceProtocol is HTTP or TCP,  the
                            listener's InstanceProtocol must be HTTP or TCP.

                            tificate.

                     PolicyNames -> (list)
                        The policies. If there are no  policies  enabled,  the
                        list is empty.

                            The  time  period,  in  seconds,  after  which the
                            cookie should be considered stale. If this parame-
                            ter is not specified, the stickiness session lasts
                            for the duration of the browser session.

                 OtherPolicies -> (list)
                     The policies other than the stickiness policies.

              VPCId -> (string)
                 The ID of the VPC for the load balancer.

              Instances -> (list)
                 The IDs of the instances for the load balancer.

                 (structure)
                     The ID of an EC2 instance.

                     InstanceId -> (string)
                        The instance ID.

              HealthCheck -> (structure)
                 Information  about  the  health  checks conducted on the load
                 balancer.

                 Target -> (string)
                     The instance being checked. The protocol is  either  TCP,
                     HTTP,  HTTPS, or SSL. The range of valid ports is one (1)
                     through 65535.

                     TCP is the default, specified as a TCP:  port  pair,  for
                     example  "TCP:5000".  In this case, a health check simply
                     attempts to open a TCP connection to the instance on  the
                     specified  port. Failure to connect within the configured
                     timeout is considered unhealthy.

                     SSL is also specified as SSL:  port  pair,  for  example,
                     SSL:5000.

                     For  HTTP/HTTPS,  you  must  include  a  ping path in the
                     string. HTTP is specified  as  a  HTTP:port;/;PathToPing;
                     grouping, for example "HTTP:80/weather/us/wa/seattle". In
                     this case, a HTTP GET request is issued to  the  instance
                     on  the  given  port and path. Any answer other than "200
                     OK" within the timeout period is considered unhealthy.

                     The total length of the HTTP ping  target  must  be  1024
                     16-bit Unicode characters or less.

                 Interval -> (integer)
                     The  approximate  interval,  in  seconds,  between health
