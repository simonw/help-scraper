NAME
       describe-load-balancer-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the attributes for the specified load balancer.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-load-balancer-attributes
          --load-balancer-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-name (string)
          The name of the load balancer.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe the attributes of a load balancer

       This example describes the attributes of the specified load balancer.

       Command:

          aws elb describe-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-name my-load-balancer

       Output:

          {
            "LoadBalancerAttributes": {
                "ConnectionDraining": {
                    "Enabled": false,
                    "Timeout": 300
                },
                "CrossZoneLoadBalancing": {
                    "Enabled": true
                },
                "ConnectionSettings": {
                    "IdleTimeout": 30
                },
                "AccessLog": {
                    "Enabled": false
              }
            }
          }

OUTPUT
       LoadBalancerAttributes -> (structure)
          Information about the load balancer attributes.

          CrossZoneLoadBalancing -> (structure)
              If  enabled, the load balancer routes the request traffic evenly
              across all instances regardless of the Availability Zones.

              For more information, see Configure Cross-Zone Load Balancing in
              the Classic Load Balancers Guide .

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  cross-zone  load balancing is enabled for
                 the load balancer.

          AccessLog -> (structure)
              If enabled, the load balancer captures detailed  information  of
              all  requests  and  delivers  the  information  to the Amazon S3
              bucket that you specify.

              For more information, see Enable Access Logs in the Classic Load
              Balancers Guide .

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  access logs are enabled for the load bal-
                 ancer.

              S3BucketName -> (string)
                 The name of the Amazon S3 bucket where the  access  logs  are
                 stored.

              EmitInterval -> (integer)
                 The  interval for publishing the access logs. You can specify
                 an interval of either 5 minutes or 60 minutes.

                 Default: 60 minutes

              S3BucketPrefix -> (string)
                 The logical hierarchy you created for your Amazon S3  bucket,
                 for example my-bucket-prefix/prod . If the prefix is not pro-
                 vided, the log is placed at the root level of the bucket.

          ConnectionDraining -> (structure)
              If enabled, the load balancer allows existing requests  to  com-
              plete before the load balancer shifts traffic away from a dereg-
              istered or unhealthy instance.

              For more information, see Configure Connection Draining  in  the
              Classic Load Balancers Guide .

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether connection draining is enabled for the load
                 balancer.

              Timeout -> (integer)
                 The maximum time, in seconds, to keep  the  existing  connec-
                 tions open before deregistering the instances.

          ConnectionSettings -> (structure)
              If  enabled,  the load balancer allows the connections to remain
              idle (no data is sent over the connection) for the specified du-
              ration.

              By  default,  Elastic  Load Balancing maintains a 60-second idle
              connection timeout for both front-end and  back-end  connections
              of  your load balancer. For more information, see Configure Idle
              Connection Timeout in the Classic Load Balancers Guide .

              IdleTimeout -> (integer)
                 The time, in seconds, that the connection is  allowed  to  be
                 idle (no data has been sent over the connection) before it is
                 closed by the load balancer.

          AdditionalAttributes -> (list)
              Any additional attributes.

              (structure)
                 Information about additional load balancer attributes.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The name of the attribute.

                     The following attribute is supported.

                     o elb.http.desyncmitigationmode - Determines how the load
                       balancer  handles  requests  that might pose a security
                       risk to your application. The possible values are moni-
                       tor , defensive , and strictest . The default is defen-
                       sive .

                 Value -> (string)
                     This value of the attribute.
