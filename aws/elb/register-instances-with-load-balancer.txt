NAME
       register-instances-with-load-balancer -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds the specified instances to the specified load balancer.

       The instance must be a running instance in the same network as the load
       balancer (EC2-Classic or the same VPC). If  you  have  EC2-Classic  in-
       stances  and a load balancer in a VPC with ClassicLink enabled, you can
       link the EC2-Classic instances to that VPC and then register the linked
       EC2-Classic instances with the load balancer in the VPC.

       Note  that  RegisterInstanceWithLoadBalancer completes when the request
       has been registered. Instance registration takes a little time to  com-
       plete.  To  check  the  state  of  the  registered  instances, use  De-
       scribeLoadBalancers or  DescribeInstanceHealth .

       After the instance is registered, it starts receiving traffic  and  re-
       quests  from  the load balancer. Any instance that is not in one of the
       Availability Zones registered for the load balancer  is  moved  to  the
       OutOfService  state.  If an Availability Zone is added to the load bal-
       ancer later, any instances registered with the load  balancer  move  to
       the InService state.

       To deregister instances from a load balancer, use  DeregisterInstances-
       FromLoadBalancer .

       For more information, see Register or De-Register EC2 Instances in  the
       Classic Load Balancers Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            register-instances-with-load-balancer
          --load-balancer-name <value>
          --instances <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-name (string)
          The name of the load balancer.

       --instances (list)
          The IDs of the instances.

          (structure)
              The ID of an EC2 instance.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The instance ID.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          --instances InstanceId1 InstanceId2 InstanceId3

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "InstanceId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To register instances with a load balancer

       This example registers the specified instance with the  specified  load
       balancer.

       Command:

          aws elb register-instances-with-load-balancer --load-balancer-name my-load-balancer --instances i-d6f6fae3

       Output:

          {
             "Instances": [
                 {
                     "InstanceId": "i-d6f6fae3"
                 },
                 {
                     "InstanceId": "i-207d9717"
                 },
                 {
                     "InstanceId": "i-afefb49b"
                 }
             ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Instances -> (list)
          The updated list of instances for the load balancer.

          (structure)
              The ID of an EC2 instance.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The instance ID.
