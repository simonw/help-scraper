DESCRIPTION
       Wait  until JMESPath query InstanceStates[].State returns InService for
       all elements when polling with describe-instance-health. It  will  poll
       every  15  seconds until a successful state has been reached. This will
       exit with a return code of 255 after 40 failed checks.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            instance-in-service
          --load-balancer-name <value>
          [--instances <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-name (string)
          The name of the load balancer.

       --instances (list)
          The IDs of the instances.

          (structure)
              The ID of an EC2 instance.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The instance ID.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          InstanceId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "InstanceId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To pause running until the specified instance is in service

       The  following  wait  instance-in-service  command pauses and continues

          aws elb wait instance-in-service \
              --load-balancer-name my-loadbalancer \
              --instances InstanceId=i-1234567890abcdef0
