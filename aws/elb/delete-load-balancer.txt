DELETE-LOAD-BALANCER()                                  DELETE-LOAD-BALANCER()



NAME
       delete-load-balancer -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the specified load balancer.

       If you are attempting to recreate a load balancer, you must reconfigure
       all settings. The DNS name associated with a deleted load balancer  are
       no  longer  usable.  The  name and associated DNS record of the deleted
       load balancer no longer exist and traffic sent to any  of  its  IP  ad-
       dresses is no longer delivered to your instances.

       If  the  load  balancer does not exist or has already been deleted, the
       call to DeleteLoadBalancer still succeeds.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-load-balancer
          --load-balancer-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-name (string)
          The name of the load balancer.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
