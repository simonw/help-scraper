NAME
       update-application-resource-lifecycle -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies lifecycle settings for an application.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-application-resource-lifecycle
          --application-name <value>
          --resource-lifecycle-config <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          The name of the application.

       --resource-lifecycle-config (structure)
          The lifecycle configuration.

          ServiceRole -> (string)
              The  ARN  of an IAM service role that Elastic Beanstalk has per-
              mission to assume.

              The ServiceRole property is required the  first  time  that  you
              provide  a  VersionLifecycleConfig for the application in one of
              the supporting calls (CreateApplication or  UpdateApplicationRe-
              sourceLifecycle  ).  After you provide it once, in either one of
              the calls, Elastic Beanstalk persists the Service Role with  the
              application,  and  you  don't need to specify it again in subse-
              quent UpdateApplicationResourceLifecycle calls.  You  can,  how-
              ever,  specify it in subsequent calls to change the Service Role
              to another value.

          VersionLifecycleConfig -> (structure)
              Defines lifecycle settings for application versions.

              MaxCountRule -> (structure)
                 Specify a max count rule to restrict the number  of  applica-
                 tion versions that are retained for an application.

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     Specify true to apply the rule, or false to disable it.

                 MaxCount -> (integer)
                     Specify the maximum number of application versions to re-
                     tain.

                 DeleteSourceFromS3 -> (boolean)
                     Set to true to delete a version's source bundle from Ama-
                     zon  S3  when  Elastic  Beanstalk deletes the application
                     version.

              MaxAgeRule -> (structure)
                 Specify a max age rule to restrict the length  of  time  that
                 application versions are retained for an application.

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     Specify true to apply the rule, or false to disable it.

                 MaxAgeInDays -> (integer)
                     Specify  the number of days to retain an application ver-
                     sions.

                 DeleteSourceFromS3 -> (boolean)
                     Set to true to delete a version's source bundle from Ama-
                     zon  S3  when  Elastic  Beanstalk deletes the application
                     version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ServiceRole=string,VersionLifecycleConfig={MaxCountRule={Enabled=boolean,MaxCount=integer,DeleteSourceFromS3=boolean},MaxAgeRule={Enabled=boolean,MaxAgeInDays=integer,DeleteSourceFromS3=boolean}}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ServiceRole": "string",
            "VersionLifecycleConfig": {
              "MaxCountRule": {
                "Enabled": true|false,
                "MaxCount": integer,
                "DeleteSourceFromS3": true|false
              },
              "MaxAgeRule": {
                "Enabled": true|false,
                "MaxAgeInDays": integer,
                "DeleteSourceFromS3": true|false
              }
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
