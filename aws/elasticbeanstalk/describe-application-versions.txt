NAME
       describe-application-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve a list of application versions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-application-versions  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: ApplicationVersions

SYNOPSIS
            describe-application-versions
          [--application-name <value>]
          [--version-labels <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          Specify an application name to show only  application  versions  for
          that application.

       --version-labels (list)
          Specify a version label to show a specific application version.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The  following  command retrieves information about an application ver-
       sion labeled v2:

                 o Unprocessed  Application version  wasn't  pre-processed  or
                   validated.  Elastic  Beanstalk  will validate configuration
                   files during deployment of the application  version  to  an
                   environment.

                 o Processing   Elastic  Beanstalk is currently processing the
                   application version.

                 o Building  Application version is  currently  undergoing  an
                   AWS CodeBuild build.

                 o Processed  Elastic Beanstalk was successfully pre-processed
                   and validated.

                 o Failed  Either the AWS CodeBuild build failed or configura-
                   tion files didn't pass validation. This application version
                   isn't usable.

       NextToken -> (string)
          In a paginated request, the token that you can pass in a  subsequent
          request to get the next response page.
