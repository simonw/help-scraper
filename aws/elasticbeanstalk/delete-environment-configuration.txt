NAME
       delete-environment-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  draft  configuration associated with the running environ-
       ment.

       Updating a running environment with any configuration changes creates a
       draft configuration set. You can get the draft configuration using  De-
       scribeConfigurationSettings while the update is in progress or  if  the
       update  fails.  The  DeploymentStatus for the draft configuration indi-
       cates whether the deployment is in process or  has  failed.  The  draft
       configuration  remains  in  existence until it is deleted with this ac-
       tion.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-environment-configuration
          --application-name <value>
          --environment-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          The name of the application the environment is associated with.

       --environment-name (string)
          The name of the environment to delete the draft configuration from.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
