DESCRIBE-ENVIRONMENTS()                                DESCRIBE-ENVIRONMENTS()



NAME
       describe-environments -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns descriptions for existing environments.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-environments  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Environments

SYNOPSIS
            describe-environments
          [--application-name <value>]
          [--version-label <value>]
          [--environment-ids <value>]
          [--environment-names <value>]
          [--include-deleted | --no-include-deleted]
          [--included-deleted-back-to <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          If specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned  descrip-
          tions  to  include only those that are associated with this applica-
          tion.

       --version-label (string)
          If specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned  descrip-
          tions  to  include only those that are associated with this applica-
          tion version.

       --environment-ids (list)
          If specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned  descrip-
          tions to include only those that have the specified IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --environment-names (list)
          If  specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned descrip-
          tions to include only those that have the specified names.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --include-deleted | --no-include-deleted (boolean)
          Indicates whether to include deleted environments:
              true : Environments that have been deleted after  IncludedDelet-
              edBackTo are displayed.

              false : Do not include deleted environments.

       --included-deleted-back-to (timestamp)
          If  specified when IncludeDeleted is set to true , then environments
          deleted after this date are displayed.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To view information about an environment

       The  following command retrieves information about an environment named
       my-env:

          aws elasticbeanstalk describe-environments --environment-names my-env

                   functional.

                 o Grey : Default health for a new environment.  The  environ-
                   ment  is  not  fully  launched  and  health checks have not

                     A  link  to  another environment, defined in the environ-
                     ment's manifest. Links provide connection information  in
                     system  properties that can be used to connect to another
                     environment in the same group. See  Environment  Manifest
                     (env.yaml) for details.

                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  environment's  opera-
                 tions role. For more information, see Operations roles in the
                 AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide .

       NextToken -> (string)
