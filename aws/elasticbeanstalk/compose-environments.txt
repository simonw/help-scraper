COMPOSE-ENVIRONMENTS()                                  COMPOSE-ENVIRONMENTS()



NAME
       compose-environments -

DESCRIPTION
       Create  or update a group of environments that each run a separate com-
       ponent of a single application. Takes a list  of  version  labels  that
       specify application source bundles for each of the environments to cre-
       ate or update. The name of each environment and other required informa-
       tion  must be included in the source bundles in an environment manifest
       named env.yaml . See Compose Environments for details.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            compose-environments
          [--application-name <value>]
          [--group-name <value>]
          [--version-labels <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          The name of the application to which the  specified  source  bundles
          belong.

       --group-name (string)
          The name of the group to which the target environments belong. Spec-
          ify a group name only if the environment name defined in each target
          environment's   manifest   ends  with  a  +  (plus)  character.  See
          Environment Manifest (env.yaml) for details.

       --version-labels (list)
          A list of version labels, specifying one or more application  source
          bundles  that  belong  to the target application. Each source bundle
          must include an environment manifest that specifies the name of  the
          environment  and  the name of the solution stack to use, and option-
          ally can specify environment links to create.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 o Green : Indicates the  environment  is  healthy  and  fully
                   functional.

                 o Grey  :  Default health for a new environment. The environ-
