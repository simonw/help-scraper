LIST-PLATFORM-VERSIONS()                              LIST-PLATFORM-VERSIONS()



NAME
       list-platform-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  platform  versions available for your account in an AWS Re-
       gion. Provides summary information about each platform version. Compare
       to   DescribePlatformVersion , which provides full details about a sin-
       gle platform version.

       For definitions of platform version and other  platform-related  terms,
       see AWS Elastic Beanstalk Platforms Glossary .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-platform-versions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: PlatformSummaryList

SYNOPSIS
            list-platform-versions
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Criteria for restricting the resulting list  of  platform  versions.
          The filter is interpreted as a logical conjunction (AND) of the sep-
          arate PlatformFilter terms.

          (structure)
              Describes criteria to restrict the results when listing platform
              versions.

              The filter is evaluated as follows: Type Operator Values[1]

              Type -> (string)
                 The platform version attribute to which the filter values are
                 applied.

                 Valid values: PlatformName | PlatformVersion | PlatformStatus
                 | PlatformBranchName | PlatformLifecycleState | PlatformOwner
                 | SupportedTier | SupportedAddon | ProgrammingLanguageName  |
                 OperatingSystemName

              Operator -> (string)
                 The operator to apply to the Type with each of the Values .

                 Valid  values:  =  |  !=  |  < | <= | > | >= | contains | be-
                 gins_with | ends_with

              Values -> (list)
                 The list of values applied to the filtering platform  version
                 attribute. Only one value is supported for all current opera-
                 tors.

                 The following list shows valid filter values for some  filter
                 attributes.

                 o PlatformStatus  :  Creating  |  Failed | Ready | Deleting |
                   Deleted

                 o PlatformLifecycleState : recommended

                 o SupportedTier : WebServer/Standard | Worker/SQS/HTTP

                 o SupportedAddon : Log/S3 | Monitoring/Healthd  |  WorkerDae-
                   mon/SQSD

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,Operator=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Type": "string",
              "Operator": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PlatformSummaryList -> (list)
          Summary information about the platform versions.

          (structure)
              Summary information about a platform version.

                 The version of the operating system used by the platform ver-
                 sion.

                 Possible values: recommended | empty

                 If  an  empty value is returned, the platform version is sup-
                 ported but isn't the recommended one for its branch.

              PlatformVersion -> (string)
                 The version string of the platform version.

              PlatformBranchName -> (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          In a paginated request, if this value isn't null ,  it's  the  token
          that  you  can pass in a subsequent request to get the next response
          page.
