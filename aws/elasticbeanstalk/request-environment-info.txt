REQUEST-ENVIRONMENT-INFO()                          REQUEST-ENVIRONMENT-INFO()



NAME
       request-environment-info -

DESCRIPTION
       Initiates a request to compile the specified type of information of the
       deployed environment.

       Setting the InfoType to tail compiles the last lines from the  applica-
       tion server log files of every Amazon EC2 instance in your environment.

       Setting  the  InfoType  to bundle compresses the application server log
       files for every Amazon EC2 instance into a .zip file. Legacy  and  .NET
       containers do not support bundle logs.

       Use  RetrieveEnvironmentInfo to obtain the set of logs.

SYNOPSIS
            request-environment-info
          [--environment-id <value>]
          [--environment-name <value>]
          --info-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --environment-id (string)
          The ID of the environment of the requested data.

          If  no  such environment is found, RequestEnvironmentInfo returns an
          InvalidParameterValue error.

          Condition: You must specify either this or  an  EnvironmentName,  or
          both.  If  you  do not specify either, AWS Elastic Beanstalk returns
          MissingRequiredParameter error.

       --environment-name (string)
          The name of the environment of the requested data.

          If no such environment is found, RequestEnvironmentInfo  returns  an
          InvalidParameterValue error.

          Condition:  You  must  specify  either  this or an EnvironmentId, or
          both. If you do not specify either, AWS  Elastic  Beanstalk  returns
          MissingRequiredParameter error.

       --info-type (string)
          The type of information to request.

          Possible values:

          o tail

          o bundle

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To request tailed logs

       The following command requests logs from an environment named my-env:

          aws elasticbeanstalk request-environment-info --environment-name my-env --info-type tail

       After     requesting     logs,    retrieve    their    location    with
       retrieve-environment-info.

OUTPUT
       None
