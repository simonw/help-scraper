NAME
       disassociate-environment-operations-role -

DESCRIPTION
       Disassociate  the  operations role from an environment. After this call
       is made, Elastic Beanstalk uses the caller's  permissions  for  permis-
       sions to downstream services during subsequent calls acting on this en-
       vironment. For more information, see Operations roles in the AWS  Elas-
       tic Beanstalk Developer Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-environment-operations-role
          --environment-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --environment-name (string)
          The  name  of  the environment from which to disassociate the opera-
          tions role.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
