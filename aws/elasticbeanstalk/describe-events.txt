DESCRIBE-EVENTS()                                            DESCRIBE-EVENTS()



NAME
       describe-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  list  of event descriptions matching criteria up to the last 6
       weeks.

       NOTE:
          This action returns the most recent 1,000 events from the  specified
          NextToken .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-events is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Events

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          If specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned  descrip-
          tions to include only those associated with this application.

       --version-label (string)
          If  specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned descrip-
          tions to those associated with this application version.

       --template-name (string)
          If specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned  descrip-
          tions  to those that are associated with this environment configura-
          tion.

       --environment-id (string)
          If specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned  descrip-
          tions to those associated with this environment.

       --environment-name (string)
          If  specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned descrip-
          tions to those associated with this environment.

       --platform-arn (string)
          The ARN of a custom platform  version.  If  specified,  AWS  Elastic
          Beanstalk  restricts  the  returned descriptions to those associated
          with this custom platform version.

       --request-id (string)
          If specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the  described  events
          to include only those associated with this request ID.

       --severity (string)
          If  specified,  limits the events returned from this call to include
          only those with the specified severity or higher.

          Possible values:

          o TRACE

          o DEBUG

          o INFO

          o WARN

          o ERROR

          o FATAL

       --start-time (timestamp)
          If specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned  descrip-
          tions to those that occur on or after this time.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          If  specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned descrip-
          tions to those that occur up to, but not including, the EndTime .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
