          The name of the builder environment.

       --option-settings (list)
          The  configuration  option settings to apply to the builder environ-
          ment.

          (structure)
              A specification identifying an individual  configuration  option
              along  with its current value. For a list of possible namespaces
              and  option  values,  see  Option  Values  in  the  AWS  Elastic
              Beanstalk Developer Guide .

              ResourceName -> (string)
                 A  unique  resource name for the option setting. Use it for a
                 timebased scaling configuration option.

              Namespace -> (string)
                 A unique namespace that identifies  the  option's  associated
                 AWS resource.

              OptionName -> (string)
                 The name of the configuration option.

              Value -> (string)
                 The current value for the configuration option.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResourceName=string,Namespace=string,OptionName=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ResourceName": "string",
              "Namespace": "string",

            ...
          ]

       --tags (list)
          Specifies the tags applied to the new platform version.

          Elastic  Beanstalk  applies these tags only to the platform version.
          Environments that you create using the platform  version  don't  in-
          herit the tags.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag applied to a resource in an environment.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",

            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
