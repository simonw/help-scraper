CREATE-APPLICATION-VERSION()                      CREATE-APPLICATION-VERSION()



NAME
       create-application-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  application version for the specified application. You can
       create an application version from a source bundle in Amazon S3, a com-
       mit  in AWS CodeCommit, or the output of an AWS CodeBuild build as fol-
       lows:

       Specify a commit in an AWS CodeCommit repository with SourceBuildInfor-
       mation .

       Specify  a  build  in  an AWS CodeBuild with SourceBuildInformation and
       BuildConfiguration .

       Specify a source bundle in S3 with SourceBundle

       Omit both SourceBuildInformation and SourceBundle to  use  the  default
       sample application.

       NOTE:
          After  you  create an application version with a specified Amazon S3
          bucket and key location, you can't change that Amazon  S3  location.
          If  you change the Amazon S3 location, you receive an exception when
          you attempt to launch an environment from the application version.

              o For CodeCommit , the format is the repository name and  commit
                ID,    separated    by   a   forward   slash.   For   example,
                my-git-repo/265cfa0cf6af46153527f55d6503ec030551f57a .

              o For S3 , the format is the S3 bucket name and object key, sep-
                arated  by  a  forward  slash. For example, my-s3-bucket/Fold-

              sion-label  -artifact-name  .zip.  If  not   provided,   Elastic
              Beanstalk stores the build artifact in the S3 location S3-bucket
              /resources/application-name   /codebuild/codebuild-version-label
              .zip.

          CodeBuildServiceRole -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access
              Management (IAM) role that enables  AWS  CodeBuild  to  interact

              marked as completed. The default is 60 minutes.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ArtifactName=string,CodeBuildServiceRole=string,ComputeType=string,Image=string,TimeoutInMinutes=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ArtifactName": "string",

       --auto-create-application | --no-auto-create-application (boolean)
          Set  to  true to create an application with the specified name if it
          doesn't already exist.

       --process | --no-process (boolean)
          Pre-processes and validates the environment manifest (env.yaml ) and
          configuration  files (*.config files in the .ebextensions folder) in
          the source bundle. Validating configuration files can  identify  is-
          sues prior to deploying the application version to an environment.

          You must turn processing on for application versions that you create
          using AWS CodeBuild or  AWS  CodeCommit.  For  application  versions
          built from a source bundle in Amazon S3, processing is optional.

          NOTE:
              The  Process  option  validates  Elastic Beanstalk configuration
              files. It  doesn't  validate  your  application's  configuration
              files, like proxy server or Docker configuration.

       --tags (list)
          Specifies the tags applied to the application version.

          Elastic  Beanstalk  applies  these tags only to the application ver-
          sion. Environments that use the application  version  don't  inherit
          the tags.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag applied to a resource in an environment.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a new application version

       The  following  command  creates  a new version, "v1" of an application
       named "MyApp":

          aws elasticbeanstalk create-application-version --application-name MyApp --version-label v1 --description MyAppv1 --source-bundle S3Bucket="my-bucket",S3Key="sample.war" --auto-create-application

       The application will be created automatically if it  does  not  already
       exist,  due to the auto-create-application option. The source bundle is
       a .war file stored in an s3 bucket named "my-bucket" that contains  the
       Apache Tomcat sample application.

       Output:

          {
            "ApplicationVersion": {
                "ApplicationName": "MyApp",
                "VersionLabel": "v1",
                "Description": "MyAppv1",
                "DateCreated": "2015-02-03T23:01:25.412Z",
                "DateUpdated": "2015-02-03T23:01:25.412Z",
                "SourceBundle": {
                    "S3Bucket": "my-bucket",
                    "S3Key": "sample.war"
                }
            }
          }
