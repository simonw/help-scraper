NAME
       securityhub -

DESCRIPTION
       Security  Hub  provides  you  with a comprehensive view of the security
       state of your Amazon Web Services environment and  resources.  It  also
       provides  you  with  the  readiness status of your environment based on
       controls from supported security standards. Security Hub collects secu-
       rity  data  from Amazon Web Services accounts, services, and integrated
       third-party products and helps you analyze security trends in your  en-
       vironment  to  identify  the highest priority security issues. For more
       information about Security  Hub,  see  the  `  Security  HubUser  Guide
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html`__
       .

       When you use operations in the Security Hub API, the requests are  exe-
       cuted  only  in the Amazon Web Services Region that is currently active
       or in the specific Amazon Web Services Region that you specify in  your
       request. Any configuration or settings change that results from the op-
       eration is applied only to that Region. To  make  the  same  change  in
       other  Regions,  execute  the same command for each Region to apply the
       change to.

       For example, if your Region is set to us-west-2 , when you use  Create-
       Members to add a member account to Security Hub, the association of the
       member account with the administrator account is created  only  in  the
       us-west-2  Region.  Security Hub must be enabled for the member account
       in the same Region that the invitation was sent from.

       tions.
