LOOKUP-DEVELOPER-IDENTITY()                        LOOKUP-DEVELOPER-IDENTITY()



NAME
       lookup-developer-identity -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  IdentityID associated with a DeveloperUserIdentifier or
       the list of DeveloperUserIdentifier values associated with  an  Identi-
       tyId  for an existing identity. Either IdentityID or DeveloperUserIden-
       tifier must not be null. If you supply only one of  these  values,  the
       other  value will be searched in the database and returned as a part of
       the response. If  you  supply  both,  DeveloperUserIdentifier  will  be
       matched  against  IdentityID  .  If the values are verified against the
       database, the response returns both values and is the same as  the  re-
       quest. Otherwise a ResourceConflictException is thrown.
          LookupDeveloperIdentity is intended for low-throughput control plane
          operations: for example, to enable customer  service  to  locate  an
          identity ID by username. If you are using it for higher-volume oper-
          ations such as user authentication, your requests are likely  to  be
          throttled.   GetOpenIdTokenForDeveloperIdentity  is  a better option
          for higher-volume operations for user authentication.

       You must use AWS Developer credentials to call this API.

SYNOPSIS
            lookup-developer-identity
          --identity-pool-id <value>
          [--identity-id <value>]
          [--developer-user-identifier <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --identity-pool-id (string)
          An identity pool ID in the format REGION:GUID.

       --identity-id (string)
          A unique identifier in the format REGION:GUID.

       --developer-user-identifier (string)
          A unique ID used by your backend authentication process to  identify
          a  user.  Typically,  a developer identity provider would issue many
          developer user identifiers, in keeping with the number of users.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of identities to return.

       --next-token (string)
          A pagination token. The first call you make will have NextToken  set
          to  null.  After  that  the  service will return NextToken values as
          needed. For example, let's say you make a  request  with  MaxResults
          set  to  10,  and  there are 20 matches in the database. The service
          will return a pagination token as a part of the response. This token
          can  be used to call the API again and get results starting from the
          11th match.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       IdentityId -> (string)
          A unique identifier in the format REGION:GUID.

       DeveloperUserIdentifierList -> (list)
          This  is  the  list of developer user identifiers associated with an
          identity ID. Cognito supports the association of multiple  developer
          user identifiers with an identity ID.

          (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  pagination token. The first call you make will have NextToken set
          to null. After that the service  will  return  NextToken  values  as
          needed.  For  example,  let's say you make a request with MaxResults
          set to 10, and there are 20 matches in  the  database.  The  service
          will return a pagination token as a part of the response. This token
          can be used to call the API again and get results starting from  the
          11th match.
