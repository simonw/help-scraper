DESCRIBE-IDENTITY-POOL()                              DESCRIBE-IDENTITY-POOL()



NAME
       describe-identity-pool -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets details about a particular identity pool, including the pool name,
       ID description, creation date, and current number of users.

       You must use AWS Developer credentials to call this API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-identity-pool
          --identity-pool-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --identity-pool-id (string)
          An identity pool ID in the format REGION:GUID.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe an identity pool

       This example describes an identity pool.

       Command:

          aws cognito-identity describe-identity-pool --identity-pool-id "us-west-2:11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"

       Output:

          {
            "IdentityPoolId": "us-west-2:11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
            "IdentityPoolName": "MyIdentityPool",
            "AllowUnauthenticatedIdentities": false,
            "CognitoIdentityProviders": [
                {
                    "ProviderName": "cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/us-west-2_111111111",
                    "ClientId": "3n4b5urk1ft4fl3mg5e62d9ado",
                    "ServerSideTokenCheck": false
                }
            ]
          }

OUTPUT
       IdentityPoolId -> (string)
          An identity pool ID in the format REGION:GUID.

       IdentityPoolName -> (string)
          A string that you provide.

       AllowUnauthenticatedIdentities -> (boolean)
          TRUE if the identity pool supports unauthenticated logins.

       AllowClassicFlow -> (boolean)
          Enables or disables the Basic  (Classic)  authentication  flow.  For
          more  information, see Identity Pools (Federated Identities) Authen-
          tication Flow in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

       SupportedLoginProviders -> (map)
          Optional key:value pairs mapping provider names to provider app IDs.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       DeveloperProviderName -> (string)
          The "domain" by which Cognito will refer to your users.

       OpenIdConnectProviderARNs -> (list)
          The ARNs of the OpenID Connect providers.

          (string)

       CognitoIdentityProviders -> (list)
          A list representing an Amazon Cognito user pool and its client ID.

          (structure)
              A provider representing an Amazon  Cognito  user  pool  and  its
              client ID.

              ProviderName -> (string)
                 The  provider name for an Amazon Cognito user pool. For exam-
                 ple,  cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/us-east-1_123456789
                 .

              ClientId -> (string)
                 The client ID for the Amazon Cognito user pool.

              ServerSideTokenCheck -> (boolean)
                 TRUE if server-side token validation is enabled for the iden-
                 tity providers token.

                 Once you set ServerSideTokenCheck to  TRUE  for  an  identity
                 pool,  that identity pool will check with the integrated user
                 pools to make sure that the user has not been globally signed
                 out  or deleted before the identity pool provides an OIDC to-
                 ken or AWS credentials for the user.

                 If the user is signed out or deleted, the identity pool  will
                 return a 400 Not Authorized error.

       SamlProviderARNs -> (list)
          An  array  of  Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the SAML provider for
          your identity pool.

          (string)

       IdentityPoolTags -> (map)
          The tags that are assigned to the identity pool. A tag  is  a  label
          that  you  can apply to identity pools to categorize and manage them
          in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or  other
          criteria.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
