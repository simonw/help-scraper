MERGE-DEVELOPER-IDENTITIES()                      MERGE-DEVELOPER-IDENTITIES()



NAME
       merge-developer-identities -

DESCRIPTION
       Merges  two  users  having different IdentityId s, existing in the same
       identity pool, and identified by the same developer provider.  You  can
       use this action to request that discrete users be merged and identified
       as a single user in the Cognito  environment.  Cognito  associates  the
       given  source  user  (SourceUserIdentifier ) with the IdentityId of the
       DestinationUserIdentifier . Only developer-authenticated users  can  be
       merged.  If  the users to be merged are associated with the same public
       provider, but as two different users, an exception will be thrown.

       The number of linked logins is limited to 20. So, the number of  linked
       logins  for the source user, SourceUserIdentifier , and the destination
       user, DestinationUserIdentifier , together should not  be  larger  than
       20. Otherwise, an exception will be thrown.

       You must use AWS Developer credentials to call this API.

SYNOPSIS
            merge-developer-identities
          --source-user-identifier <value>
          --destination-user-identifier <value>
          --developer-provider-name <value>
          --identity-pool-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-user-identifier (string)
          User identifier for the source user. The value should be a Develope-
          rUserIdentifier .

       --destination-user-identifier (string)
          User identifier for the destination user. The value should be a  De-
          veloperUserIdentifier .

       --developer-provider-name (string)
          The  "domain"  by  which Cognito will refer to your users. This is a
          (pseudo) domain name that you provide  while  creating  an  identity
          pool.  This  name acts as a placeholder that allows your backend and
          the Cognito service to communicate about the developer provider. For
          the  DeveloperProviderName  ,  you can use letters as well as period
          (.), underscore (_), and dash (-).

       --identity-pool-id (string)
          An identity pool ID in the format REGION:GUID.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       IdentityId -> (string)
          A unique identifier in the format REGION:GUID.
