OPTIONS
       --identity-pool-id (string)
          An identity pool ID in the format REGION:GUID.

       --identity-pool-name (string)
          A string that you provide.

       --allow-unauthenticated-identities | --no-allow-unauthenticated-identi-
       ties (boolean)
          TRUE if the identity pool supports unauthenticated logins.

       --allow-classic-flow | --no-allow-classic-flow (boolean)

          tication Flow in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

       --supported-login-providers (map)
          Optional key:value pairs mapping provider names to provider app IDs.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --developer-provider-name (string)
          The "domain" by which Cognito will refer to your users.

       --open-id-connect-provider-arns (list)
          The ARNs of the OpenID Connect providers.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cognito-identity-providers (list)
          A list representing an Amazon Cognito user pool and its client ID.

          (structure)
              A provider representing an Amazon  Cognito  user  pool  and  its
              client ID.

              ProviderName -> (string)
                 The  provider name for an Amazon Cognito user pool. For exam-
                 ple,  cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/us-east-1_123456789
                 .

              ClientId -> (string)
                 The client ID for the Amazon Cognito user pool.

              ServerSideTokenCheck -> (boolean)
                 TRUE if server-side token validation is enabled for the iden-
                 tity providers token.

                 Once you set ServerSideTokenCheck to  TRUE  for  an  identity
                 pool,  that identity pool will check with the integrated user
                 pools to make sure that the user has not been globally signed
                 out  or deleted before the identity pool provides an OIDC to-
                 ken or AWS credentials for the user.

                 If the user is signed out or deleted, the identity pool  will
                 return a 400 Not Authorized error.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ProviderName=string,ClientId=string,ServerSideTokenCheck=boolean ...

       JSON Syntax:

              "ClientId": "string",
              "ServerSideTokenCheck": true|false
            }
            ...
          ]

       --saml-provider-arns (list)
          An  array  of  Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the SAML provider for
          your identity pool.

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --identity-pool-tags (map)
          The tags that are assigned to the identity pool. A tag  is  a  label
          that  you  can apply to identity pools to categorize and manage them
          in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or  other
          criteria.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update an identity pool

       This  example updates an identity pool. It sets the name to MyIdentity-
       Pool. It adds Cognito as an identity provider.  It disallows  unauthen-
       ticated identities.

       Command:

          aws cognito-identity update-identity-pool --identity-pool-id "us-west-2:11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111" --identity-pool-name "MyIdentityPool" --no-allow-unauthenticated-identities --cognito-identity-providers ProviderName="cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/us-west-2_111111111",ClientId="3n4b5urk1ft4fl3mg5e62d9ado",ServerSideTokenCheck=false

       Output:

          {
            "IdentityPoolId": "us-west-2:11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
            "IdentityPoolName": "MyIdentityPool",
            "AllowUnauthenticatedIdentities": false,
            "CognitoIdentityProviders": [
                {
                    "ProviderName": "cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/us-west-2_111111111",
                    "ClientId": "3n4b5urk1ft4fl3mg5e62d9ado",
                    "ServerSideTokenCheck": false
                }
            ]
          }

       IdentityPoolId -> (string)
          An identity pool ID in the format REGION:GUID.

       IdentityPoolName -> (string)
          A string that you provide.

       AllowUnauthenticatedIdentities -> (boolean)
          TRUE if the identity pool supports unauthenticated logins.

       AllowClassicFlow -> (boolean)
          Enables  or  disables  the  Basic (Classic) authentication flow. For
          more information, see Identity Pools (Federated Identities)  Authen-
          tication Flow in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

       SupportedLoginProviders -> (map)

          (structure)
              A  provider  representing  an  Amazon  Cognito user pool and its
              client ID.

              ProviderName -> (string)
                 The provider name for an Amazon Cognito user pool. For  exam-
                 ple,  cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/us-east-1_123456789

                 Once  you  set  ServerSideTokenCheck  to TRUE for an identity
                 pool, that identity pool will check with the integrated  user

                 out or deleted before the identity pool provides an OIDC  to-
                 ken or AWS credentials for the user.
