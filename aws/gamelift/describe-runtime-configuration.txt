DESCRIBE-RUNTIME-CONFIGURATION()              DESCRIBE-RUNTIME-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       describe-runtime-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a fleet's runtime configuration settings. The runtime config-
       uration tells GameLift which server processes to run (and how) on  each
       instance in the fleet.

       To  get  the  runtime  configuration  that is currently in forces for a
       fleet, provide the fleet ID.

       If successful, a  RuntimeConfiguration object is returned for  the  re-
       quested  fleet. If the requested fleet has been deleted, the result set
       is empty.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-runtime-configuration
          --fleet-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to get the  runtime  configuration
          for. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To request the runtime configuration for a fleet

       The  following describe-runtime-configuration example retrieves details
       about the current runtime configuration for a specified fleet.

          aws gamelift describe-runtime-configuration \
              --fleet-id fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

OUTPUT
       RuntimeConfiguration -> (structure)
          Instructions  that  describe how server processes should be launched
          and maintained on each instance in the fleet.

          ServerProcesses -> (list)
              A collection of server process configurations that identify what
              server processes to run on each instance in a fleet.

              (structure)
                 A  set of instructions for launching server processes on each
                 instance in a fleet. Server  processes  run  either  an  exe-
                 cutable  in a custom game build or a Realtime Servers script.
                 Server process configurations are part of a fleet's  Runtime-
                 Configuration .

                 LaunchPath -> (string)
                     The  location  of a game build executable or the Realtime
                     script file  that  contains  the  Init()  function.  Game
                     builds and Realtime scripts are installed on instances at
                     the root:

                     o Windows (custom game builds only): C:\game  .  Example:
                       "C:\game\MyGame\server.exe "

                     o Linux:      /local/game      .      Examples:     "/lo-
                       cal/game/MyGame/server.exe  "  or  "/local/game/MyReal-
                       timeScript.js "

                 Parameters -> (string)
                     An optional list of parameters to pass to the server exe-
                     cutable or Realtime script on launch.

                 ConcurrentExecutions -> (integer)
                     The number of server processes using  this  configuration
                     that run concurrently on each instance.

          MaxConcurrentGameSessionActivations -> (integer)
              The  number of game sessions in status ACTIVATING to allow on an
              instance. This setting limits the instance resources that can be
              used for new game activations at any one time.

          GameSessionActivationTimeoutSeconds -> (integer)
              The  maximum amount of time (in seconds) allowed to launch a new
              game session and have it report ready to  host  players.  During
              this  time,  the  game  session is in status ACTIVATING . If the
              game session does not become active before the  timeout,  it  is
              ended and the game session status is changed to TERMINATED .
