CREATE-FLEET()                                                  CREATE-FLEET()



NAME
       create-fleet -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a fleet of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon Elastic Compute
       Cloud) instances to host your custom game server or  Realtime  Servers.
       Use  this operation to configure the computing resources for your fleet
       and provide instructions for running game servers on each instance.

       Most GameLift fleets can deploy instances to  multiple  locations,  in-
       cluding  the  home  Region (where the fleet is created) and an optional
       set of remote locations. Fleets that are created in the following  Ama-
       zon Web Services Regions support multiple locations: us-east-1 (N. Vir-
       ginia), us-west-2 (Oregon), eu-central-1 (Frankfurt),  eu-west-1  (Ire-
       land),  ap-southeast-2  (Sydney), ap-northeast-1 (Tokyo), and ap-north-
       east-2 (Seoul). Fleets that are created in other GameLift  Regions  can
       deploy  instances  in the fleet's home Region only. All fleet instances
       use the same configuration regardless of location; however, you can ad-
       just capacity settings and turn auto-scaling on/off for each location.

       To  create  a  fleet, choose the hardware for your instances, specify a
       game server build or Realtime script to deploy, and provide  a  runtime
       configuration  to  direct GameLift how to start and run game servers on
       each instance in the fleet. Set permissions for inbound traffic to your
       game  servers,  and enable optional features as needed. When creating a
       multi-location fleet, provide a list of additional remote locations.

       If you need to debug your fleet, fetch logs, view  performance  metrics
       or  other  actions on the fleet, create the development fleet with port
       22/3389 open. As a best practice, we recommend opening ports for remote
       access only when you need them and closing them when you're finished.

       If  successful,  this operation creates a new Fleet resource and places
       it in NEW status, which prompts GameLift to initiate the fleet creation
       workflow  . You can track fleet creation by checking fleet status using
       DescribeFleetAttributes and  DescribeFleetLocationAttributes /,  or  by
       monitoring  fleet  creation events using  DescribeFleetEvents . As soon
       as the fleet status changes to ACTIVE , you can enable automatic  scal-
       ing  for the fleet with  PutScalingPolicy and set capacity for the home
       Region with  UpdateFleetCapacity . When the status of each remote loca-
       tion  reaches  ACTIVE , you can set capacity by location using  Update-
       FleetCapacity .

          not need to be unique.

       --description (string)
          A human-readable description of the fleet.

       --build-id (string)
          The unique identifier for a custom game server build to be  deployed
          on  fleet  instances.  You  can  use either the build ID or ARN. The
          build must be uploaded to GameLift and in READY status.  This  fleet
          property cannot be changed later.

       --script-id (string)
          The  unique identifier for a Realtime configuration script to be de-
          ployed on fleet instances. You can use either the script ID or  ARN.
          Scripts  must  be  uploaded to GameLift prior to creating the fleet.
          This fleet property cannot be changed later.

       --server-launch-path (string)
          This parameter is no longer used. Specify a server launch path using
          the RuntimeConfiguration parameter. Requests that use this parameter
          instead continue to be valid.

       --server-launch-parameters (string)
          This parameter is no longer used. Specify server  launch  parameters
          using the RuntimeConfiguration parameter. Requests that use this pa-
          rameter instead continue to be valid.

       --log-paths (list)
              This parameter is no longer  used.  To  specify  where  GameLift
              should store log files once a server process shuts down, use the
              GameLift server API ProcessReady() and specify one or  more  di-
              rectory  paths  in  logParameters  . See more information in the
              Server API Reference .

       --ec2-inbound-permissions (list)
          The allowed IP address ranges and port settings that  allow  inbound
          traffic to access game sessions on this fleet. If the fleet is host-
          ing a custom game build, this property must be  set  before  players
          can  connect to game sessions. For Realtime Servers fleets, GameLift
          automatically sets TCP and UDP ranges.

          (structure)
              A range of IP addresses and port  settings  that  allow  inbound
              traffic  to  connect  to  server  processes  on an instance in a
              fleet. New game sessions are assigned an IP address/port  number
              combination,  which  must  fall into the fleet's allowed ranges.
              Fleets with custom game builds must have permissions  explicitly
              set.  For  Realtime Servers fleets, GameLift automatically opens
              two port ranges, one for TCP messaging and one for UDP.

                     DescribeFleetPortSettings

              FromPort -> (integer)
                 A starting value for a range of allowed port numbers.

                 For  fleets  using  Windows  and  Linux  builds,  only  ports
                 1026-60000 are valid.

              ToPort -> (integer)
                 An  ending  value  for  a range of allowed port numbers. Port
                 numbers are end-inclusive. This value  must  be  higher  than
                 FromPort .

                 For  fleets  using  Windows  and  Linux  builds,  only  ports
                 1026-60000 are valid.

              IpRange -> (string)
                 A range of allowed IP addresses. This value must be expressed
                 in  CIDR  notation. Example: "000.000.000.000/[subnet mask] "
                 or optionally the shortened version "0.0.0.0/[subnet mask] ".

              Protocol -> (string)
                 The network communication protocol used by the fleet.

            }
            ...
          ]

       --new-game-session-protection-policy (string)
          The status of termination protection for active game sessions on the
          fleet.  By  default,  this property is set to NoProtection . You can
          also set game session protection for an individual game  session  by
          calling  UpdateGameSession .

          o NoProtection - Game sessions can be terminated during active game-
            play as a result of a scale-down event.

          o FullProtection - Game sessions in ACTIVE status cannot  be  termi-
            nated during a scale-down event.

          Possible values:

          o NoProtection

          o FullProtection

       --runtime-configuration (structure)
          Instructions  for how to launch and maintain server processes on in-
          stances in the fleet. The runtime configuration defines one or  more
          server  process  configurations, each identifying a build executable
          or Realtime script file and the number of processes of that type  to
          run concurrently.

          NOTE:
              The  RuntimeConfiguration parameter is required unless the fleet
              is being configured using the older parameters  ServerLaunchPath
              and ServerLaunchParameters , which are still supported for back-
              ward compatibility.

          ServerProcesses -> (list)
              A collection of server process configurations that identify what
              server processes to run on each instance in a fleet.

              (structure)
                 A  set of instructions for launching server processes on each
                 instance in a fleet. Server  processes  run  either  an  exe-
                 cutable  in a custom game build or a Realtime Servers script.
                 Server process configurations are part of a fleet's  Runtime-
                 Configuration .

                 LaunchPath -> (string)
                     The  location  of a game build executable or the Realtime
                     script file  that  contains  the  Init()  function.  Game
                     builds and Realtime scripts are installed on instances at
                     the root:

                     o Windows (custom game builds only): C:\game  .  Example:
                       "C:\game\MyGame\server.exe "

                     o Linux:      /local/game      .      Examples:     "/lo-
                       cal/game/MyGame/server.exe  "  or  "/local/game/MyReal-
                       timeScript.js "

                 Parameters -> (string)
                     An optional list of parameters to pass to the server exe-
                     cutable or Realtime script on launch.

                 ConcurrentExecutions -> (integer)
                     The number of server processes using  this  configuration
                     that run concurrently on each instance.

          MaxConcurrentGameSessionActivations -> (integer)
              The  number of game sessions in status ACTIVATING to allow on an
              instance. This setting limits the instance resources that can be
              used for new game activations at any one time.

          GameSessionActivationTimeoutSeconds -> (integer)
              The  maximum amount of time (in seconds) allowed to launch a new
              game session and have it report ready to  host  players.  During
              this  time,  the  game  session is in status ACTIVATING . If the
              game session does not become active before the  timeout,  it  is
              ended and the game session status is changed to TERMINATED .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ServerProcesses=[{LaunchPath=string,Parameters=string,ConcurrentExecutions=integer},{LaunchPath=string,Parameters=string,ConcurrentExecutions=integer}],MaxConcurrentGameSessionActivations=integer,GameSessionActivationTimeoutSeconds=integer

          }

       --resource-creation-limit-policy (structure)
          A  policy that limits the number of game sessions that an individual
          player can create on instances in this fleet within a specified span
          of time.

          NewGameSessionsPerCreator -> (integer)
              The  maximum number of game sessions that an individual can cre-
              ate during the policy period.

          PolicyPeriodInMinutes -> (integer)
              The time span used in evaluating  the  resource  creation  limit
              policy.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          NewGameSessionsPerCreator=integer,PolicyPeriodInMinutes=integer

       --metric-groups (list)
          The  name  of  an Amazon Web Services CloudWatch metric group to add
          this fleet to. A metric group is used to aggregate the  metrics  for
          multiple  fleets.  You  can specify an existing metric group name or
          set a new name to create a new metric group. A fleet can be included
          in only one metric group at a time.

          "string" "string" ...

       --peer-vpc-aws-account-id (string)
          Used when peering your GameLift fleet with a VPC, the unique identi-
          fier for the Amazon Web Services account that owns the VPC. You  can
          find  your  account ID in the Amazon Web Services Management Console
          under account settings.

       --peer-vpc-id (string)
          A unique identifier for a VPC with resources to be accessed by  your
          GameLift fleet. The VPC must be in the same Region as your fleet. To
          look up a VPC ID, use the VPC Dashboard in the Amazon  Web  Services
          Management Console. Learn more about VPC peering in VPC Peering with
          GameLift Fleets .

       --fleet-type (string)
          Indicates whether to use On-Demand or Spot instances for this fleet.
          By  default,  this  property  is set to ON_DEMAND . Learn more about
          when to use On-Demand versus Spot Instances . This  property  cannot
          be changed after the fleet is created.

          Possible values:

          o ON_DEMAND

          o SPOT

       --instance-role-arn (string)
          A unique identifier for an IAM role that manages access to your Ama-
          zon Web Services services. With an instance role ARN set, any appli-
          cation  that  runs on an instance in this fleet can assume the role,
          including install scripts, server processes, and daemons (background
          processes).  Create  a role or look up a role's ARN by using the IAM
          dashboard in the Amazon Web Services Management Console. Learn  more
          about  using  on-box credentials for your game servers at Access ex-
          ternal resources from a  game  server  .  This  property  cannot  be
          changed after the fleet is created.

       --certificate-configuration (structure)
          Prompts  GameLift  to  generate a TLS/SSL certificate for the fleet.
          TLS certificates  are  used  for  encrypting  traffic  between  game
          clients  and  the  game servers that are running on GameLift. By de-
          fault, the CertificateConfiguration is set to DISABLED . This  prop-
          erty cannot be changed after the fleet is created.

          Note: This feature requires the Amazon Web Services Certificate Man-
          ager (ACM) service, which is not available in all  Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices  regions.  When working in a region that does not support this
          feature, a fleet creation request with certificate generation  fails
          with a 4xx error.

          CertificateType -> (string)
              Indicates  whether  a  TLS/SSL  certificate  is  generated for a
              fleet.

              Valid values include:

              o GENERATED - Generate a TLS/SSL certificate for this fleet.

              o DISABLED - (default) Do not generate a TLS/SSL certificate for
                this fleet.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CertificateType=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CertificateType": "DISABLED"|"GENERATED"
          }

       --locations (list)
          A set of remote locations to deploy additional instances to and man-
          age as part of the fleet. This parameter can only be used when  cre-
          ating  fleets  in  Amazon Web Services Regions that support multiple
          locations. You can add any GameLift-supported  Amazon  Web  Services
          Region  as  a remote location, in the form of an Amazon Web Services
          Region code such as us-west-2 . To create a fleet with instances  in
          the home Region only, omit this parameter.

          (structure)
              A  remote  location  where a multi-location fleet can deploy EC2
              instances for game hosting.

       --tags (list)
          A list of labels to assign to the new fleet resource. Tags  are  de-
          veloper-defined  key-value  pairs.  Tagging  Amazon Web Services re-
          sources are useful for resource management,  access  management  and
          cost  allocation.  For more information, see Tagging Amazon Web Ser-
          vices Resources in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .  Once
          the  fleet  is  created, you can use  TagResource ,  UntagResource ,
          and  ListTagsForResource to add, remove, and view tags. The  maximum
          tag limit may be lower than stated. See the Amazon Web Services Gen-
          eral Reference for actual tagging limits.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       Example 4: To create a Realtime Servers fleet

       The following create-fleet example creates a fleet  of  Spot  instances
       with  a  Realtime configuration script that has been uploaded to Amazon
       GameLift. All Realtime servers are deployed onto  Linux  machines.  For
       the  purposes of this example, assume that the uploaded Realtime script
       includes multiple script files, with the Init() function located in the
       script  file called MainScript.js. As shown, this file is identified as
       the launch script in the runtime configuration.

          aws gamelift create-fleet \
              --name MegaFrogRace.NA.realtime \

              o ERROR  --  An  error  occurred  when  downloading, validating,
                building, or activating the fleet.

              o DELETING -- Hosts are responding to a delete fleet request.

              o TERMINATED -- The fleet no longer exists.

          BuildId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the build resource that is  deployed  on
              instances in this fleet.

          BuildArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN ) associated with the GameLift

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN )  associated  with  the  GameLift
              script  resource that is deployed on instances in this fleet. In
              a GameLift script ARN, the  resource  ID  matches  the  ScriptId
              value.

          ServerLaunchPath -> (string)
              This  parameter  is  no longer used. Server launch paths are now
              defined using the fleet's  RuntimeConfiguration  parameter.  Re-
              quests that use this parameter instead continue to be valid.

          ServerLaunchParameters -> (string)
              This  parameter  is no longer used. Server launch parameters are
              now defined using the fleet's   RuntimeConfiguration  parameter.

          NewGameSessionProtectionPolicy -> (string)
              The type of game session protection to set on all new  instances
              that are started in the fleet.

              o NoProtection  --  The  game session can be terminated during a
                scale-down event.

              o FullProtection -- If the game session is in an ACTIVE  status,
                it cannot be terminated during a scale-down event.

          OperatingSystem -> (string)
              The  operating  system  of  the  fleet's  computing resources. A
              fleet's operating system is determined by the OS of the build or
              script that is deployed on this fleet.

          ResourceCreationLimitPolicy -> (structure)
              The  fleet policy that limits the number of game sessions an in-
              dividual player can create over a span of time.

              NewGameSessionsPerCreator -> (integer)
                 The maximum number of game sessions that  an  individual  can
                 create during the policy period.

              PolicyPeriodInMinutes -> (integer)
                 The  time span used in evaluating the resource creation limit
                 policy.

          MetricGroups -> (list)
              Name of a metric group that metrics for this fleet are added to.
              In Amazon CloudWatch, you can view aggregated metrics for fleets
              that are in a metric group. A fleet can be included in only  one
              metric group at a time.

              (string)

          StoppedActions -> (list)
              A   list  of  fleet  activity  that  has  been  suspended  using
              StopFleetActions . This includes fleet auto-scaling.

              (string)

          InstanceRoleArn -> (string)
              A unique identifier for an IAM role that manages access to  your
              Amazon Web Services services. With an instance role ARN set, any
              application that runs on an instance in this  fleet  can  assume
              the  role, including install scripts, server processes, and dae-
              mons (background processes). Create a role or look up  a  role's
              ARN  by  using the IAM dashboard in the Amazon Web Services Man-
              agement Console. Learn more about using on-box  credentials  for
              your  game  servers  at  Access  external  resources from a game
              server .

          CertificateConfiguration -> (structure)
              Indicates whether a TLS/SSL certificate was  generated  for  the
              fleet.

              CertificateType -> (string)
                 Indicates  whether  a  TLS/SSL certificate is generated for a
                 fleet.

                 Valid values include:

                 o GENERATED - Generate a TLS/SSL certificate for this fleet.

                 o DISABLED - (default) Do not generate a TLS/SSL  certificate
                   for this fleet.

       LocationStates -> (list)
          The  fleet's  locations  and life-cycle status of each location. For
          new fleets, the status of all locations is set to NEW . During fleet
          creation, GameLift updates each location status as instances are de-
          ployed there and prepared for game hosting. This  list  includes  an
          entry  for  the fleet's home Region. For fleets with no remote loca-
          tions, only one entry, representing the home Region, is returned.

          (structure)
              A fleet location and its life-cycle state. A location state  ob-
              ject might be used to describe a fleet's remote location or home
              Region. Life-cycle state tracks the progress  of  launching  the
              first instance in a new location and preparing it for game host-
              ing, and then removing all instances and deleting  the  location
              from the fleet.
