CREATE-ALIAS()                                                  CREATE-ALIAS()



NAME
       create-alias -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias
       ID in place of a fleet ID. An alias provides a level of abstraction for
       a  fleet  that is useful when redirecting player traffic from one fleet
       to another, such as when updating your game build.

       Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies  for  aliases:
       simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A termi-
       nal alias is used to display messaging or link  to  a  URL  instead  of
       routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a termi-
       nal alias when a game version is no longer supported and  you  want  to
       direct players to an upgrade site.

       To  create  a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and
       optional description. Each simple alias can point to  only  one  fleet,
       but  a  fleet  can  have  multiple  aliases. If successful, a new alias
       record is returned, including an alias ID and an ARN. You can  reassign
       an alias to another fleet by calling UpdateAlias .

SYNOPSIS
            create-alias
          --name <value>
          [--description <value>]
          --routing-strategy <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A descriptive label that is associated with an alias. Alias names do
          not need to be unique.

       --description (string)
          A human-readable description of the alias.

       --routing-strategy (structure)
          The  routing configuration, including routing type and fleet target,
          for the alias.

          Type -> (string)
              The type of routing strategy for the alias.

              Possible routing types include the following:

              o SIMPLE - The alias resolves to one specific  fleet.  Use  this
                type when routing to active fleets.

              o TERMINAL  -  The alias does not resolve to a fleet but instead
                can be used to display a message to the user. A terminal alias
                throws  a  TerminalRoutingStrategyException  with  the   Rout-
                ingStrategy message embedded.

          FleetId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the fleet that the alias points to. This
              value is the fleet ID, not the fleet ARN.

          Message -> (string)
              The message text to be used with a terminal routing strategy.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,FleetId=string,Message=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Type": "SIMPLE"|"TERMINAL",
            "FleetId": "string",
            "Message": "string"
          }

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of labels to assign to the new alias resource. Tags are de-
          veloper-defined key-value pairs. Tagging AWS  resources  are  useful
          for  resource management, access management and cost allocation. For
          more information, see Tagging AWS Resources in the AWS General  Ref-
          erence  .  Once  the resource is created, you can use  TagResource ,
          UntagResource , and  ListTagsForResource to add,  remove,  and  view
          tags.  The  maximum  tag limit may be lower than stated. See the AWS
          General Reference for actual tagging limits.

          (structure)
              A label that can be assigned to a GameLift resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for a developer-defined key:value pair for tagging an
                 AWS resource.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for a developer-defined key:value pair for  tagging
                 an AWS resource.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       Alias -> (structure)
          The newly created alias resource.

          AliasId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the alias. Alias IDs are unique within a
              Region.

          Name -> (string)
              A descriptive label that is  associated  with  an  alias.  Alias
              names do not need to be unique.

          AliasArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a GameLift
              alias resource and  uniquely  identifies  it.  ARNs  are  unique
              across    all    Regions.    Format   is   arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
              gion>::alias/alias-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912 .  In  a
              GameLift alias ARN, the resource ID matches the alias ID value.

          Description -> (string)
              A human-readable description of an alias.

          RoutingStrategy -> (structure)
              The routing configuration, including routing type and fleet tar-
              get, for the alias.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of routing strategy for the alias.

                 Possible routing types include the following:

                 o SIMPLE - The alias resolves to one specific fleet. Use this
                   type when routing to active fleets.

                 o TERMINAL  -  The  alias does not resolve to a fleet but in-
                   stead can be used to display a message to the user. A  ter-
                   minal  alias throws a TerminalRoutingStrategyException with
                   the  RoutingStrategy message embedded.

              FleetId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the fleet that the alias  points  to.
                 This value is the fleet ID, not the fleet ARN.

              Message -> (string)
                 The message text to be used with a terminal routing strategy.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A  time stamp indicating when this data object was created. For-
              mat is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for  ex-
              ample "1469498468.057" ).

          LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
              The  time  that  this data object was last modified. Format is a
              number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds  (for  example
              "1469498468.057" ).
