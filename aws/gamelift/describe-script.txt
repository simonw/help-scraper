SYNOPSIS
            describe-script
          --script-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --script-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the Realtime script to retrieve properties
          for. You can use either the script ID or ARN value.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Script -> (structure)
          A set of properties describing the requested script.

          ScriptId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the Realtime script

          ScriptArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a GameLift
              script resource and uniquely  identifies  it.  ARNs  are  unique
              across  all  Regions.  In a GameLift script ARN, the resource ID
              matches the ScriptId value.

          Name -> (string)
              A descriptive label that is associated  with  a  script.  Script
              names do not need to be unique.

          Version -> (string)
              Version  information  that is associated with a build or script.
              Version strings do not need to be unique.

          SizeOnDisk -> (long)
              The file size of the  uploaded  Realtime  script,  expressed  in
              bytes.  When  files are uploaded from an S3 location, this value
              remains at "0".

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A time stamp indicating when this data object was created.  For-
              mat  is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for ex-
              ample "1469498468.057" ).

          StorageLocation -> (structure)
              The location in Amazon S3 where build or script files are stored
              for access by Amazon Web Services. This location is specified in
              CreateBuild ,  CreateScript , and  UpdateScript requests.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 An Amazon S3 bucket identifier. This is the name  of  the  S3
                 bucket.

                 NOTE:
                     GameLift currently does not support uploading from Amazon
                     S3 buckets with names that contain a dot (.).

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the zip file that contains  the  build  files  or
                 script files.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN ) for an IAM role that allows
                 Amazon Web Services to access the S3 bucket.

              ObjectVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the file, if object versioning  is  turned  on
                 for  the  bucket.  Amazon  Web Services uses this information
                 when retrieving files from an S3 bucket  that  you  own.  Use
                 this  parameter to specify a specific version of the file. If
                 not set, the latest version of the file is retrieved.
