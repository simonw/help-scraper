DESCRIBE-FLEET-LOCATION-CAPACITY()          DESCRIBE-FLEET-LOCATION-CAPACITY()



NAME
       describe-fleet-location-capacity -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the resource capacity settings for a fleet location. The data
       returned includes the current capacity (number of  EC2  instances)  and
       some scaling settings for the requested fleet location. Use this opera-
       tion to retrieve capacity information for a fleet's remote location  or
       home  Region (you can also retrieve home Region capacity by calling De-
       scribeFleetCapacity ).

       To retrieve capacity data, identify a fleet and location.

       If successful, a FleetCapacity object is  returned  for  the  requested
       fleet location.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-fleet-location-capacity
          --fleet-id <value>
          --location <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique identifier for the fleet to request location capacity for.
          You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --location (string)
          The fleet location to retrieve capacity information for.  Specify  a
          location in the form of an AWS Region code, such as us-west-2 .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FleetCapacity -> (structure)
          Resource capacity information for the requested fleet location.  Ca-
          pacity  objects are returned only for fleets and locations that cur-
          rently exist.

          FleetId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the fleet associated with the location.

          FleetArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to  a  GameLift
              fleet  resource  and  uniquely  identifies  it.  ARNs are unique
              across   all   Regions.    Format    is    arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
              gion>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912 .

          InstanceType -> (string)
              The EC2 instance type that is used for all instances in a fleet.
              The instance type determines the computing resources in use, in-
              cluding  CPU,  memory,  storage,  and  networking  capacity. See
              Amazon EC2 Instance Types for detailed descriptions.

          InstanceCounts -> (structure)
              The current instance count and capacity settings for  the  fleet
              location.

              DESIRED -> (integer)
                 Ideal number of active instances. GameLift will always try to
                 maintain the desired number of instances. Capacity is  scaled
                 up or down by changing the desired instances.

              MINIMUM -> (integer)
                 The minimum instance count value allowed.

              MAXIMUM -> (integer)
                 The maximum instance count value allowed.

              PENDING -> (integer)
                 Number of instances that are starting but not yet active.

              ACTIVE -> (integer)
                 Actual  number  of instances that are ready to host game ses-
                 sions.

              IDLE -> (integer)
                 Number of active instances that are not currently  hosting  a
                 game session.

              TERMINATING -> (integer)
                 Number of instances that are no longer active but haven't yet
                 been terminated.

          Location -> (string)
              The fleet location for the instance count information, expressed
              as an AWS Region code, such as us-west-2 .
