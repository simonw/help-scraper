DESCRIBE-FLEET-EVENTS()                                DESCRIBE-FLEET-EVENTS()



NAME
       describe-fleet-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  entries from a fleet's event log. Fleet events are initiated
       by changes in status, such as during fleet  creation  and  termination,
       changes in capacity, etc. If a fleet has multiple locations, events are
       also initiated by changes to status and capacity in remote locations.

       You can specify a time range to limit the result set. Use  the  pagina-
       tion parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.

       If  successful,  a collection of event log entries matching the request
       are returned.

       describe-fleet-events is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Events

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to get event logs for. You can use
          either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The earliest date to retrieve event logs for. If no  start  time  is
          specified,  this  call  returns entries starting from when the fleet
          was created to the specified end time. Format is a number  expressed
          in Unix time as milliseconds (ex: "1469498468.057").

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The  most  recent date to retrieve event logs for. If no end time is
          specified, this call returns entries from the specified  start  time
          up to the present. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as mil-
          liseconds (ex: "1469498468.057").

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       Events -> (list)
          A  collection of objects containing event log entries for the speci-
          fied fleet.

          (structure)
              Log entry describing an event that involves  GameLift  resources
              (such as a fleet). In addition to tracking activity, event codes
              and  messages  can  provide  additional  information  for  trou-
              bleshooting and debugging problems.

              EventId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for a fleet event.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier  for an event resource, such as a fleet
                 ID.

              EventCode -> (string)
                 The type of event being logged.
                     Fleet state transition events:

                 o FLEET_CREATED -- A fleet resource was successfully  created
                   with  a  status of NEW . Event messaging includes the fleet
                   ID.

                 o FLEET_STATE_DOWNLOADING -- Fleet status changed from NEW to
                   DOWNLOADING  . The compressed build has started downloading
                   to a fleet instance for installation.

                 o FLEET_STATE_VALIDATING -- Fleet status changed  from  DOWN-
                   LOADING  to  VALIDATING  .  GameLift has successfully down-
                   loaded the build and is now validating the build files.

                 o FLEET_STATE_BUILDING -- Fleet status changed from  VALIDAT-
                   ING  to  BUILDING  . GameLift has successfully verified the
                   build files and is now running the installation scripts.

                 o FLEET_STATE_ACTIVATING -- Fleet status changed from  BUILD-
                   ING  to  ACTIVATING  .  GameLift is trying to launch an in-
                   stance and test the connectivity between the build and  the
                   GameLift Service via the Server SDK.

                 o FLEET_STATE_ACTIVE -- The fleet's status changed from ACTI-
                   VATING to ACTIVE . The fleet is now ready to host game ses-
                   sions.

                 o FLEET_STATE_ERROR  -- The Fleet's status changed to ERROR .
                   Describe the fleet event message for more details.
                     Fleet creation events (ordered by fleet  creation  activ-
                     ity):

                 o FLEET_BINARY_DOWNLOAD_FAILED  --  The build failed to down-
                   load to the fleet instance.

                 o FLEET_CREATION_EXTRACTING_BUILD -- The  game  server  build
                   was  successfully  downloaded to an instance, and the build
                   files are now being extracted from the uploaded  build  and
                   saved  to  an  instance.  Failure  at this stage prevents a
                   fleet from moving to ACTIVE status.  Logs  for  this  stage
                   display a list of the files that are extracted and saved on
                   the instance. Access the logs by  using  the  URL  in  Pre-
                   SignedLogUrl .

                 o FLEET_CREATION_RUNNING_INSTALLER  --  The game server build
                   files were successfully extracted, and the GameLift is  now
                   running  the  build's  install script (if one is included).
                   Failure in this stage prevents a fleet from moving  to  AC-
                   TIVE  status.  Logs  for  this  stage list the installation
                   steps and whether or not  the  install  completed  success-
                   fully.  Access the logs by using the URL in PreSignedLogUrl
                   .

                 o FLEET_CREATION_VALIDATING_RUNTIME_CONFIG   --   The   build
                   process  was  successful, and the GameLift is now verifying
                   that the game server launch paths, which are  specified  in
                   the  fleet's  runtime  configuration,  exist. If any listed
                   launch path exists, GameLift tries to launch a game  server
                   process and waits for the process to report ready. Failures
                   in this stage prevent a fleet from moving to ACTIVE status.
                   Logs  for  this  stage list the launch paths in the runtime
                   configuration and indicate whether each  is  found.  Access
                   the logs by using the URL in PreSignedLogUrl .

                 o FLEET_VALIDATION_LAUNCH_PATH_NOT_FOUND -- Validation of the
                   runtime configuration failed because the executable  speci-
                   fied in a launch path does not exist on the instance.

                 o FLEET_VALIDATION_EXECUTABLE_RUNTIME_FAILURE  --  Validation
                   of the runtime configuration failed because the  executable
                   specified  in  a launch path failed to run on the fleet in-
                   stance.

                 o FLEET_VALIDATION_TIMED_OUT -- Validation of  the  fleet  at
                   the end of creation timed out. Try fleet creation again.

                 o FLEET_ACTIVATION_FAILED -- The fleet failed to successfully
                   complete one of the steps in the fleet activation  process.
                   This  event code indicates that the game build was success-
                   fully downloaded to a fleet instance, built, and validated,
                   but was not able to start a server process. For more infor-
                   mation, see Debug Fleet Creation Issues .

                 o FLEET_ACTIVATION_FAILED_NO_INSTANCES -- Fleet creation  was
                   not  able  to obtain any instances based on the input fleet
                   attributes. Try again at a different time or choose a  dif-
                   ferent  combination of fleet attributes such as fleet type,
                   instance type, etc.

                 o FLEET_INITIALIZATION_FAILED -- A generic exception occurred
                   during fleet creation. Describe the fleet event message for
                   more details.
                     VPC peering events:

                 o FLEET_VPC_PEERING_SUCCEEDED -- A VPC peering connection has
                   been  established between the VPC for an GameLift fleet and
                   a VPC in your Amazon Web Services account.

                 o FLEET_VPC_PEERING_FAILED -- A requested VPC peering connec-
                   tion  has failed. Event details and status information pro-
                   vide additional detail. A common reason for peering failure
                   is  that  the two VPCs have overlapping CIDR blocks of IPv4
                   addresses. To resolve this, change the CIDR block  for  the
                   VPC  in your Amazon Web Services account. For more informa-
                   tion      on      VPC      peering      failures,       see
                   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/invalid-peering-configurations.html

                 o FLEET_VPC_PEERING_DELETED -- A VPC peering  connection  has
                   been successfully deleted.
                     Spot instance events:

                 o INSTANCE_INTERRUPTED  -- A spot instance was interrupted by
                   EC2 with a two-minute notification.
                     Server process events:

                 o SERVER_PROCESS_INVALID_PATH -- The game  server  executable
                   or  script  could  not  be found based on the Fleet runtime
                   configuration. Check that the launch path is correct  based
                   on the operating system of the Fleet.

                 o SERVER_PROCESS_SDK_INITIALIZATION_TIMEOUT   --  The  server
                   process did not call InitSDK() within  the  time  expected.
                   Check  your  game  session log to see why InitSDK() was not
                   called in time.

                 o SERVER_PROCESS_PROCESS_READY_TIMEOUT -- The server  process
                   did  not call ProcessReady() within the time expected after
                   calling InitSDK(). Check your game session log to  see  why
                   ProcessReady() was not called in time.

                 o SERVER_PROCESS_CRASHED -- The server process exited without
                   calling ProcessEnding(). Check your game session log to see
                   why ProcessEnding() was not called.

                 o SERVER_PROCESS_TERMINATED_UNHEALTHY  --  The server process
                   did not report a valid health check for too  long  and  was
                   therefore  terminated  by GameLift. Check your game session
                   log to see if the thread became stuck processing a synchro-
                   nous task for too long.

                 o SERVER_PROCESS_FORCE_TERMINATED  --  The server process did
                   not exit cleanly after OnProcessTerminate() was sent within
                   the  time  expected. Check your game session log to see why
                   termination took longer than expected.

                 o SERVER_PROCESS_PROCESS_EXIT_TIMEOUT -- The  server  process
                   did not exit cleanly within the time expected after calling
                   ProcessEnding(). Check your game session  log  to  see  why
                   termination took longer than expected.
                     Game session events:

                 o GAME_SESSION_ACTIVATION_TIMEOUT  --  GameSession  failed to
                   activate within the expected time. Check your game  session
                   log  to  see  why ActivateGameSession() took longer to com-
                   plete than expected.
                     Other fleet events:

                 o FLEET_SCALING_EVENT -- A change was made to the fleet's ca-
                   pacity settings (desired instances, minimum/maximum scaling
                   limits). Event messaging includes  the  new  capacity  set-
                   tings.

                 o FLEET_NEW_GAME_SESSION_PROTECTION_POLICY_UPDATED    --    A
                   change was made to the fleet's game session protection pol-
                   icy  setting. Event messaging includes both the old and new
                   policy setting.

                 o FLEET_DELETED -- A request to delete a fleet was initiated.

                 o GENERIC_EVENT -- An unspecified event has occurred.

              Message -> (string)
                 Additional information related to the event.

              EventTime -> (timestamp)
                 Time stamp indicating when this event occurred. Format  is  a
                 number  expressed  in  Unix time as milliseconds (for example
                 "1469498468.057" ).

              PreSignedLogUrl -> (string)
                 Location of stored logs with additional detail  that  is  re-
                 lated  to the event. This is useful for debugging issues. The
                 URL is valid for 15 minutes. You can also access  fleet  cre-
                 ation logs through the GameLift console.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates  where to resume retrieving results on the
          next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these  results
          represent the end of the list.
