CREATE-SCRIPT()                                                CREATE-SCRIPT()



NAME
       create-script -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new script record for your Realtime Servers script. Realtime
       scripts are JavaScript that provide configuration settings and optional
       custom game logic for your game. The script is deployed when you create
       a Realtime Servers fleet to host your game sessions.  Script  logic  is
       executed during an active game session.

       To  create  a  new script record, specify a script name and provide the
       script file(s). The script files and all dependencies  must  be  zipped
       into  a single file. You can pull the zip file from either of these lo-
       cations:

       o A locally available directory. Use the ZipFile parameter for this op-
         tion.

       o An  Amazon  Simple  Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket under your AWS
         account. Use the StorageLocation parameter for  this  option.  You'll
         need to have an Identity Access Management (IAM) role that allows the
         Amazon GameLift service to access your S3 bucket.

       If the call is successful, a new script record is created with a unique
       script  ID. If the script file is provided as a local file, the file is
       uploaded to an Amazon GameLift-owned S3 bucket and the script  record's
       storage location reflects this location. If the script file is provided
       as an S3 bucket, Amazon GameLift accesses the file at this storage  lo-
       cation as needed for deployment.

SYNOPSIS
            create-script
          [--name <value>]
          [--storage-location <value>]
          [--zip-file <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--script-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A descriptive label that is associated with a script.  Script  names
          do  not  need to be unique. You can use  UpdateScript to change this
          value later.

       --storage-location (structure)
          The location of the Amazon S3 bucket where a zipped file  containing
          your  Realtime  scripts is stored. The storage location must specify
          the Amazon S3 bucket name, the zip file name (the "key"), and a role
          ARN  that allows Amazon GameLift to access the Amazon S3 storage lo-
          cation. The S3 bucket must be in the same Region where you  want  to
          create  a new script. By default, Amazon GameLift uploads the latest
          version of the zip file; if you have S3 object versioning turned on,
          you  can  use the ObjectVersion parameter to specify an earlier ver-
          sion.

          Bucket -> (string)
              An Amazon S3 bucket identifier. This  is  the  name  of  the  S3
              bucket.

              NOTE:
                 GameLift  currently does not support uploading from Amazon S3
                 buckets with names that contain a dot (.).

          Key -> (string)
              The name of the zip file that contains the build files or script
              files.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) for an IAM role that allows Ama-
              zon GameLift to access the S3 bucket.

          ObjectVersion -> (string)
              The version of the file, if object versioning is turned  on  for
              the  bucket. Amazon GameLift uses this information when retriev-
              ing files from an S3 bucket that you own. Use this parameter  to
              specify  a  specific version of the file. If not set, the latest
              version of the file is retrieved.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Bucket=string,Key=string,RoleArn=string,ObjectVersion=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Bucket": "string",
            "Key": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string",
            "ObjectVersion": "string"
          }

       --zip-file (blob)
          A data object containing your Realtime scripts and dependencies as a
          zip  file. The zip file can have one or multiple files. Maximum size
          of a zip file is 5 MB.

          When using the AWS CLI tool to create a script,  this  parameter  is
          set  to  the  zip  file  name.  It must be prepended with the string
          "fileb://" to indicate that the file data is a  binary  object.  For
          example: --zip-file fileb://myRealtimeScript.zip .

       --tags (list)
          A  list of labels to assign to the new script resource. Tags are de-
          veloper-defined key-value pairs. Tagging AWS  resources  are  useful
          for  resource management, access management and cost allocation. For
          more information, see Tagging AWS Resources in the AWS General  Ref-
          erence  .  Once  the resource is created, you can use  TagResource ,
          UntagResource , and  ListTagsForResource to add,  remove,  and  view
          tags.  The  maximum  tag limit may be lower than stated. See the AWS
          General Reference for actual tagging limits.

          (structure)
              A label that can be assigned to a GameLift resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for a developer-defined key:value pair for tagging an
                 AWS resource.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for a developer-defined key:value pair for  tagging
                 an AWS resource.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --script-version (string)
          Version  information that is associated with a build or script. Ver-
          sion strings do not need to be unique. You can use  UpdateScript  to
          change this value later.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Script -> (structure)
          The newly created script record with a unique script ID and ARN. The
          new script's storage location reflects an Amazon S3 location: (1) If
          the script was uploaded from an S3 bucket under  your  account,  the
          storage  location  reflects the information that was provided in the
          CreateScript request; (2) If the script file was uploaded from a lo-
          cal  zip file, the storage location reflects an S3 location controls
          by the Amazon GameLift service.

          ScriptId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the Realtime script

          ScriptArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to  a  GameLift
              script  resource  and  uniquely  identifies  it. ARNs are unique
              across all Regions. In a GameLift script ARN,  the  resource  ID
              matches the ScriptId value.

          Name -> (string)
              A  descriptive  label  that  is associated with a script. Script
              names do not need to be unique.

          Version -> (string)
              Version information that is associated with a build  or  script.
              Version strings do not need to be unique.

          SizeOnDisk -> (long)
              The  file  size  of  the  uploaded Realtime script, expressed in
              bytes. When files are uploaded from an S3 location,  this  value
              remains at "0".

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A  time stamp indicating when this data object was created. For-
              mat is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for  ex-
              ample "1469498468.057" ).

          StorageLocation -> (structure)
              The location in Amazon S3 where build or script files are stored
              for access by Amazon GameLift. This  location  is  specified  in
              CreateBuild ,  CreateScript , and  UpdateScript requests.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 An  Amazon  S3  bucket identifier. This is the name of the S3
                 bucket.

                 NOTE:
                     GameLift currently does not support uploading from Amazon
                     S3 buckets with names that contain a dot (.).

              Key -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  zip file that contains the build files or
                 script files.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) for an IAM role  that  allows
                 Amazon GameLift to access the S3 bucket.

              ObjectVersion -> (string)
                 The  version  of  the file, if object versioning is turned on
                 for the bucket. Amazon GameLift uses  this  information  when
                 retrieving files from an S3 bucket that you own. Use this pa-
                 rameter to specify a specific version of  the  file.  If  not
                 set, the latest version of the file is retrieved.
