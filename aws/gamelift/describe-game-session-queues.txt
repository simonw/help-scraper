NAME
       describe-game-session-queues -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the properties for one or more game session queues. When re-
       questing multiple queues, use the pagination parameters to retrieve re-
       sults  as a set of sequential pages. If successful, a  GameSessionQueue
       object is returned for each requested queue. When specifying a list  of
       queues,  objects  are  returned only for queues that currently exist in
       the Region.

       describe-game-session-queues is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: GameSessionQueues

SYNOPSIS
            describe-game-session-queues
          [--names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --names (list)
          A  list  of queue names to retrieve information for. You can use ei-
          ther the queue ID or ARN value. To request settings for all  queues,
          leave this parameter empty.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GameSessionQueues -> (list)
          A  collection  of  objects  that describe the requested game session
          queues.

          (structure)
              Configuration for a game session placement mechanism  that  pro-
              cesses  requests  for  new game sessions. A queue can be used on
              its own or as part of a matchmaking solution.

              Name -> (string)
                 A  descriptive  label  that  is  associated with game session
                 queue. Queue names must be unique within each Region.

              GameSessionQueueArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN  )  that  is  assigned  to  a
                 GameLift  game session queue resource and uniquely identifies
                 it.  ARNs  are  unique  across   all   Regions.   Format   is
                 arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gamesessionqueue/<queue name> . In
                 a GameLift game session queue ARN, the  resource  ID  matches
                 the Name value.

              TimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The  maximum time, in seconds, that a new game session place-
                 ment request remains in the queue.  When  a  request  exceeds
                 this  time, the game session placement changes to a TIMED_OUT
                 status.

              PlayerLatencyPolicies -> (list)
                 A set of policies that act as a sliding  cap  on  player  la-
                 tency.  FleetIQ works to deliver low latency for most players
                 in a game session. These policies ensure that  no  individual
                 player  can  be placed into a game with unreasonably high la-
                 tency. Use multiple policies to gradually relax  latency  re-
                 quirements  a  step  at a time. Multiple policies are applied
                 based on their maximum allowed  latency,  starting  with  the
                 lowest value.

                 (structure)
                     Sets  a latency cap for individual players when placing a
                     game session. With a latency policy in force, a game ses-
                     sion  cannot be placed in a fleet location where a player
                     reports latency higher than the cap. Latency policies are
                     used  only with placement request that provide player la-
                     tency information. Player latency policies can be stacked
                     to gradually relax latency requirements over time.

                     Latency policies are part of a  GameSessionQueue .

                     MaximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds -> (integer)
                        The  maximum  latency  value  that  is allowed for any
                        player, in milliseconds.  All  policies  must  have  a
                        value set for this property.

                     PolicyDurationSeconds -> (integer)
                        The length of time, in seconds, that the policy is en-
                        forced while placing a new game session. A null  value
                        for  this  property  means that the policy is enforced
                        until the queue times out.

              Destinations -> (list)
                 A list of fleets and/or fleet aliases that  can  be  used  to
                 fulfill  game session placement requests in the queue. Desti-
                 nations are identified by either a fleet ARN or a fleet alias
                 ARN, and are listed in order of placement preference.

                 (structure)
                     A  fleet  or  alias  designated  in a game session queue.
                     Queues fulfill requests for new game sessions by  placing
                     a new game session on any of the queue's destinations.

                     Destinations are part of a  GameSessionQueue .

                     DestinationArn -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) that is assigned to
                        fleet or fleet alias. ARNs, which include a  fleet  ID
                        or  alias ID and a Region name, provide a unique iden-
                        tifier across all Regions.

              FilterConfiguration -> (structure)
                 A list of locations where a queue is  allowed  to  place  new
                 game sessions. Locations are specified in the form of AWS Re-
                 gion codes, such as us-west-2 . If this parameter is not set,
                 game sessions can be placed in any queue location.

                 AllowedLocations -> (list)
                     A  list  of locations to allow game session placement in,
                     in the form of AWS Region codes such as us-west-2 .

                     (string)

              PriorityConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Custom settings to use when prioritizing destinations and lo-
                 cations  for  game session placements. This configuration re-
                 places the FleetIQ default prioritization  process.  Priority
                 types that are not explicitly named will be automatically ap-
                 plied at the end of the prioritization process.

                 PriorityOrder -> (list)
                     The recommended sequence to use when  prioritizing  where
                     to  place new game sessions. Each type can only be listed
                     once.

                     o LATENCY -- FleetIQ prioritizes locations where the  av-
                       erage player latency (provided in each game session re-
                       quest) is lowest.

                     o COST -- FleetIQ prioritizes destinations with the  low-
                       est  current  hosting costs. Cost is evaluated based on
                       the location, instance type, and fleet  type  (Spot  or
                       On-Demand) for each destination in the queue.

                     o DESTINATION  --  FleetIQ prioritizes based on the order
                       that destinations are listed in  the  queue  configura-
                       tion.

                     o LOCATION  --  FleetIQ prioritizes based on the provided
                       order of locations, as defined in LocationOrder .

                     (string)

                 LocationOrder -> (list)
                     The prioritization order to use for fleet locations, when
                     the  PriorityOrder property includes LOCATION . Locations
                     are identified by AWS Region codes such  as  us-west-2  .
                     Each location can only be listed once.

                     (string)

              CustomEventData -> (string)
                 Information  that  is added to all events that are related to
                 this game session queue.

              NotificationTarget -> (string)
                 An SNS topic ARN that is  set  up  to  receive  game  session
                 placement  notifications.  See  Setting  up notifications for
                 game session placement .

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates where to resume  retrieving  results  on  the
          next  call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results
          represent the end of the list.
