NAME
       list-builds -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  build  resources  for all builds associated with the AWS ac-
       count in use. You can limit results to builds that are  in  a  specific
       status  by using the Status parameter. Use the pagination parameters to
       retrieve results in a set of sequential pages.

       NOTE:
              Build resources are not listed in any particular order.

       list-builds  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Builds

SYNOPSIS
            list-builds
          [--status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --status (string)
          Build status to filter results by. To  retrieve  all  builds,  leave
          this parameter empty.

          Possible build statuses include the following:

          o INITIALIZED  --  A  new  build has been defined, but no files have
            been uploaded. You cannot create fleets for  builds  that  are  in
            this  status. When a build is successfully created, the build sta-
            tus is set to this value.

          o READY -- The game build has been successfully  uploaded.  You  can
            now create new fleets for this build.

          o FAILED  --  The  game  build  upload failed. You cannot create new
            fleets for this build.

          Possible values:

          o INITIALIZED

          o READY

          o FAILED

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example1: To get a list of custom game builds

       The following list-builds example retrieves  properties  for  all  game
       server builds in the current Region. The sample request illustrates how
       to use the pagination parameters, Limit and NextToken, to retrieve  the
       results  in  sequential sets. The first command retrieves the first two
       builds. Because there are more than two  available,  the  response  in-
       cludes a NextToken to indicate that more results are available.

          aws gamelift list-builds \
              --limit 2

       Output:

          {
              "Builds": [
                  {
                      "BuildArn": "arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-2::build/build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                      "BuildId": "build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                      "CreationTime": 1495664528.723,
                      "Name": "My_Game_Server_Build_One",
                      "OperatingSystem": "WINDOWS_2012",
                      "SizeOnDisk": 8567781,
                      "Status": "READY",
                      "Version": "12345.678"
                  },
                  {
                      "BuildArn": "arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-2::build/build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",
                      "BuildId": "build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",
                      "CreationTime": 1495528748.555,
                      "Name": "My_Game_Server_Build_Two",
                      "OperatingSystem": "AMAZON_LINUX_2",
                      "SizeOnDisk": 8567781,
                      "Status": "FAILED",
                      "Version": "23456.789"
                  }
              ],
              "NextToken": "eyJhd3NBY2NvdW50SWQiOnsicyI6IjMwMjc3NjAxNjM5OCJ9LCJidWlsZElkIjp7InMiOiJidWlsZC01NWYxZTZmMS1jY2FlLTQ3YTctOWI5ZS1iYjFkYTQwMjJEXAMPLE="
          }

       You  can then call the command again with the --next-token parameter as
       follows to see the next two builds.

          aws gamelift list-builds \
              --limit 2
              --next-token eyJhd3NBY2NvdW50SWQiOnsicyI6IjMwMjc3NjAxNjM5OCJ9LCJidWlsZElkIjp7InMiOiJidWlsZC01NWYxZTZmMS1jY2FlLTQ3YTctOWI5ZS1iYjFkYTQwMjJEXAMPLE=

       Repeat until the response doesn't include a NextToken value.

       Example2: To get a list of custom game builds in failure status

       The following list-builds example retrieves  properties  for  all  game
       server builds in the current region that currently have status FAILED.

          aws gamelift list-builds \
              --status FAILED

       Output:

          {
              "Builds": [
                  {
                      "BuildArn": "arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-2::build/build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",
                      "BuildId": "build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",
                      "CreationTime": 1495528748.555,
                      "Name": "My_Game_Server_Build_Two",
                      "OperatingSystem": "AMAZON_LINUX_2",
                      "SizeOnDisk": 8567781,
                      "Status": "FAILED",
                      "Version": "23456.789"
                  }
              ]
          }

              BuildId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the build.

              BuildArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN  )  that  is  assigned  to  a
                 GameLift  build resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are
                 unique across all Regions.  Format  is  arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
                 gion>::build/build-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912  . In
                 a GameLift build ARN, the resource  ID  matches  the  BuildId
                 value.

              Name -> (string)
                 A  descriptive  label  that is associated with a build. Build
                 names do not need to be unique. It can be set using   Create-
                 Build or  UpdateBuild .

              Version -> (string)
                 Version  information  that  is  associated  with  a  build or
                 script. Version strings do not need to be unique. This  value
                 can be set using  CreateBuild or  UpdateBuild .

              Status -> (string)
                 Current status of the build.

                 Possible build statuses include the following:

                 o INITIALIZED  --  A new build has been defined, but no files
                   have been uploaded. You cannot  create  fleets  for  builds
                   that  are in this status. When a build is successfully cre-
                   ated, the build status is set to this value.

                 o READY -- The game build has been successfully uploaded. You
                   can now create new fleets for this build.

                 o FAILED  --  The game build upload failed. You cannot create
                   new fleets for this build.

              SizeOnDisk -> (long)
                 File size of the uploaded game  build,  expressed  in  bytes.
                 When the build status is INITIALIZED , this value is 0.

              OperatingSystem -> (string)
                 Operating  system  that the game server binaries are built to
                 run on. This value determines the  type  of  fleet  resources
                 that you can use for this build.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  time  stamp  indicating when this data object was created.
                 Format is a number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates  where to resume retrieving results on the
          next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these  results
          represent the end of the list.
