NAME
       delete-vpc-peering-connection -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  a  VPC  peering connection. To delete the connection, you must
       have a valid authorization for the VPC peering connection that you want
       to  delete.  You  can  check  for  an  authorization  by  calling   De-
       scribeVpcPeeringAuthorizations or  request  a  new  one  using   Creat-
       eVpcPeeringAuthorization .

       Once a valid authorization exists, call this operation from the AWS ac-
       count that is used to manage the Amazon GameLift fleets.  Identify  the
       connection  to delete by the connection ID and fleet ID. If successful,
       the connection is removed.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-vpc-peering-connection
          --fleet-id <value>
          --vpc-peering-connection-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the fleet. This fleet specified must match
          the fleet referenced in the VPC peering connection record.  You  can
          use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --vpc-peering-connection-id (string)
          A  unique identifier for a VPC peering connection. This value is in-
          cluded in the  VpcPeeringConnection object, which can  be  retrieved
          by calling  DescribeVpcPeeringConnections .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
