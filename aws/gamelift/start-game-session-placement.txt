START-GAME-SESSION-PLACEMENT()                  START-GAME-SESSION-PLACEMENT()



NAME
       start-game-session-placement -

DESCRIPTION
       Places a request for a new game session in a queue (see  CreateGameSes-
       sionQueue ). When  processing  a  placement  request,  Amazon  GameLift
       searches  for available resources on the queue's destinations, scanning
       each until it finds resources or the placement request times out.

       A game session placement request can also request player sessions. When
       a  new  game session is successfully created, Amazon GameLift creates a
       player session for each player included in the request.

       When placing a game session, by  default  Amazon  GameLift  tries  each
       fleet in the order they are listed in the queue configuration. Ideally,
       a queue's destinations are listed in preference order.

       Alternatively, when requesting a game session  with  players,  you  can
       also  provide latency data for each player in relevant Regions. Latency
       data indicates the performance lag a player experiences when  connected
       to  a fleet in the Region. Amazon GameLift uses latency data to reorder
       the list of destinations to place the game session  in  a  Region  with
       minimal  lag.  If latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon
       GameLift calculates each Region's average lag for all players  and  re-
       orders to get the best game play across all players.

       To place a new game session request, specify the following:

       o The queue name and a set of game session properties and settings

       o A  unique  ID  (such as a UUID) for the placement. You use this ID to
         track the status of the placement request

       o (Optional) A set of player data and  a  unique  player  ID  for  each
         player  that  you are joining to the new game session (player data is
         optional, but if you include it, you must also provide  a  unique  ID
         for each player)

       o Latency  data  for all players (if you want to optimize game play for
         the players)

       If successful, a new game session placement is created.

       To track the status of a placement request, call   DescribeGameSession-
       Placement  and check the request's status. If the status is FULFILLED ,
       a new game session has been created and a game session ARN  and  Region
       are  referenced.  If  the placement request times out, you can resubmit
       the request or retry it with a different queue.

OPTIONS
       --placement-id (string)
          A unique identifier to assign to the  new  game  session  placement.
          This value is developer-defined. The value must be unique across all
          Regions and cannot be reused unless you are resubmitting a  canceled
          or timed-out placement request.

       --game-session-queue-name (string)
          Name  of the queue to use to place the new game session. You can use
          either the queue name or ARN value.

       --game-properties (list)
          A set  of  custom  properties  for  a  game  session,  formatted  as
          key:value  pairs.  These  properties  are  passed  to  a game server
          process in the  GameSession object with a request  to  start  a  new
          game session (see Start a Game Session ).

          (structure)
              Set  of  key-value  pairs  that contain information about a game
              session. When included in a game session request, these  proper-
              ties communicate details to be used when setting up the new game
              session. For example, a game property might specify a game mode,
              level,  or  map.  Game  properties are passed to the game server
              process when initiating a new game session.  For  more  informa-
              tion, see the GameLift Developer Guide .

              Key -> (string)
                 The game property identifier.

              Value -> (string)

          names do not need to be unique.

       --player-latencies (list)
          A  set  of  values,  expressed  in  milliseconds, that indicates the
          amount of latency that a player experiences when connected to  @aws;
          Regions.  This information is used to try to place the new game ses-
          sion where it can offer the best possible  gameplay  experience  for
          the players.

          (structure)
              Regional  latency information for a player, used when requesting
              a new game session with  StartGameSessionPlacement . This  value
              indicates  the amount of time lag that exists when the player is
              connected to a fleet in the specified Region. The relative  dif-
              ference  between  a player's latency values for multiple Regions
              are used to determine which fleets are best suited  to  place  a
              new game session for the player.

              PlayerId -> (string)
                 A  unique identifier for a player associated with the latency
                 data.

              RegionIdentifier -> (string)
                 Name of the Region that is associated with the latency value.

              LatencyInMilliseconds -> (float)
                 Amount of time that represents the time  lag  experienced  by
                 the player when connected to the specified Region.

          PlayerId=string,RegionIdentifier=string,LatencyInMilliseconds=float ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "PlayerId": "string",
              "RegionIdentifier": "string",

          Set of information on each player to create a player session for.

          (structure)
              Player information for use when creating player sessions using a
              game session placement request with  StartGameSessionPlacement .

              PlayerId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for a player to associate with the player
                 session.

              PlayerData -> (string)
                 Developer-defined  information  related to a player. GameLift
                 does not use this data, so it can be formatted as needed  for
                 use in the game.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          PlayerId=string,PlayerData=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "PlayerId": "string",
              "PlayerData": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --game-session-data (string)
          A  set  of  custom  game  session  properties, formatted as a single
          string value. This data is passed to a game server  process  in  the
          GameSession  object  with a request to start a new game session (see
          Start a Game Session ).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       GameSessionPlacement -> (structure)
          Object that describes the newly created game session placement. This
          object includes all the information provided in the request, as well
          as start/end time stamps and placement status.

          PlacementId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for a game session placement.

          GameSessionQueueName -> (string)

              Queue names must be unique within each Region.

          Status -> (string)
              Current status of the game session placement request.

              o PENDING -- The placement request is  currently  in  the  queue
                waiting to be processed.

              o FULFILLED  --  A  new game session and player sessions (if re-
                quested) have been successfully created. Values  for  GameSes-
                sionArn and GameSessionRegion are available.

                StopGameSessionPlacement .

              o TIMED_OUT -- A new game session was not  successfully  created
                before  the time limit expired. You can resubmit the placement
                request as needed.

              o FAILED -- GameLift is not able  to  complete  the  process  of
                placing  the game session. Common reasons are the game session
                terminated before the placement process was completed,  or  an
                unexpected internal error.

          GameProperties -> (list)
              A  set  of  custom  properties  for a game session, formatted as
              key:value pairs. These properties are passed to  a  game  server
              process in the  GameSession object with a request to start a new
              game session (see Start a Game Session ).

              (structure)
                 Set of key-value pairs that contain information about a  game
                 session. When included in a game session request, these prop-
                 erties communicate details to be used when setting up the new
                 game  session.  For  example, a game property might specify a
                 game mode, level, or map. Game properties are passed  to  the
                 game  server  process when initiating a new game session. For
                 more information, see the GameLift Developer Guide .

                 Key -> (string)
                     The game property identifier.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The game property value.

          MaximumPlayerSessionCount -> (integer)

              A descriptive label that is associated with a game session. Ses-
              sion names do not need to be unique.

          GameSessionId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the game session. This value is set once
              the new game session is placed (placement status is FULFILLED ).

          GameSessionArn -> (string)
              Identifier  for  the  game session created by this placement re-
              quest. This value is set once the new  game  session  is  placed
              (placement  status  is  FULFILLED  ).  This identifier is unique
              across all Regions. You can use this value  as  a  GameSessionId
              value as needed.

          GameSessionRegion -> (string)
              Name of the Region where the game session created by this place-
              ment request is running. This value is set  once  the  new  game
              session is placed (placement status is FULFILLED ).

          PlayerLatencies -> (list)
              A  set  of values, expressed in milliseconds, that indicates the
              amount of latency that a player experiences  when  connected  to
              @aws; Regions.

              (structure)
                 Regional latency information for a player, used when request-
                 ing a new game session with  StartGameSessionPlacement . This
                 value  indicates  the amount of time lag that exists when the
                 player is connected to a fleet in the specified  Region.  The
                 relative  difference  between  a  player's latency values for
                 multiple Regions are used to determine which fleets are  best
                 suited to place a new game session for the player.

                 PlayerId -> (string)
                     A  unique identifier for a player associated with the la-
                     tency data.

                 RegionIdentifier -> (string)
                     Name of the Region that is associated  with  the  latency
                     value.

                 LatencyInMilliseconds -> (float)
                     Amount  of  time that represents the time lag experienced
                     by the player when connected to the specified Region.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              Time stamp indicating when this request was placed in the queue.
              Format  is  a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for
              example "1469498468.057" ).

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              Time stamp indicating when this request was completed, canceled,
              or timed out.

          IpAddress -> (string)
              The  IP  address  of  the game session. To connect to a GameLift
              game server, an app needs both the IP address and  port  number.
              This value is set once the new game session is placed (placement
              status is FULFILLED ).

          DnsName -> (string)
              The DNS identifier assigned to the instance that is running  the
              game session. Values have the following format:

              o TLS-enabled   fleets:   <unique   identifier>.<region  identi-
                fier>.amazongamelift.com .

              o Non-TLS-enabled fleets:  ec2-<unique  identifier>.compute.ama-
                zonaws.com . (See Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing .)

              When  connecting  to a game session that is running on a TLS-en-
              abled fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the IP address.

          Port -> (integer)
              The port number for the game session. To connect to  a  GameLift
              game  server,  an app needs both the IP address and port number.
              This value is set once the new game session is placed (placement
              status is FULFILLED ).

          PlacedPlayerSessions -> (list)
              A  collection  of  information on player sessions created in re-
              sponse to the game session placement request. These player  ses-
              sions  are  created only once a new game session is successfully
              placed (placement status is FULFILLED ).  This  information  in-
              cludes  the player ID (as provided in the placement request) and
              the corresponding player session ID. Retrieve full  player  ses-
              sions by calling  DescribePlayerSessions with the player session
              ID.

              (structure)
                 Information about a player session that was created  as  part
                 of a  StartGameSessionPlacement request. This object contains
                 only the player ID and player session ID.  To  retrieve  full
                 details  on  a  player  session, call  DescribePlayerSessions
                 with the player session ID.
