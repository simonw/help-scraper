       list-game-server-groups  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: GameServerGroups

SYNOPSIS
            list-game-server-groups
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GameServerGroups -> (list)
          A collection of game server group objects that match the request.

          (structure)
                 This data type is used with the  GameLift  FleetIQ  and  game
                 server groups.

              Properties  that  describe  a game server group resource. A game
              server group manages certain properties related to a correspond-
              ing EC2 Auto Scaling group.

              A  game  server  group  is  created by a successful call to Cre-
              ateGameServerGroup and deleted by calling  DeleteGameServerGroup
              .  Game  server  group activity can be temporarily suspended and
              resumed by calling SuspendGameServerGroup and  ResumeGameServer-
              Group , respectively.

              GameServerGroupName -> (string)
                 A developer-defined identifier for the game server group. The
                 name is unique for each Region in each AWS account.

              GameServerGroupArn -> (string)
                 A generated unique ID for the game server group.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) for an IAM role  that  allows
                 Amazon GameLift to access your EC2 Auto Scaling groups.

              InstanceDefinitions -> (list)
                 The  set  of EC2 instance types that GameLift FleetIQ can use
                 when balancing and automatically  scaling  instances  in  the
                 corresponding Auto Scaling group.

                 (structure)
                        This  data  type is used with the GameLift FleetIQ and
                        game server groups.

                     An allowed instance type for  a   GameServerGroup  .  All
                     game  server groups must have at least two instance types
                     defined for it. GameLift FleetIQ  periodically  evaluates
                     each defined instance type for viability. It then updates
                     the Auto Scaling group with the list of  viable  instance
                     types.

                     InstanceType -> (string)
                        An EC2 instance type designation.

                     WeightedCapacity -> (string)
                        Instance  weighting  that  indicates how much this in-
                        stance type contributes to the  total  capacity  of  a
                        game  server  group.  Instance  weights  are  used  by
                        GameLift FleetIQ to calculate the instance type's cost
                        per unit hour and better identify the most cost-effec-
                        tive options. For detailed  information  on  weighting
                        instance  capacity, see Instance Weighting in the Ama-
                        zon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide  .  Default  value  is
                        "1".

              BalancingStrategy -> (string)
                 Indicates  how  GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot In-
                 stances and On-Demand Instances in  the  game  server  group.
                 Method options include the following:

                 o SPOT_ONLY - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server
                   group. If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable  for
                   game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting ca-
                   pacity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until  then,
                   no  new  instances  are started, and the existing nonviable
                   Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends)
                   and are not replaced.

                 o SPOT_PREFERRED  -  (default  value) Spot Instances are used
                   whenever available in the game server group.  If  Spot  In-
                   stances are unavailable, the game server group continues to
                   provide hosting capacity by falling back to  On-Demand  In-
                   stances.  Existing  nonviable Spot Instances are terminated
                   (after current gameplay ends) and  are  replaced  with  new
                   On-Demand Instances.

                 o ON_DEMAND_ONLY  -  Only On-Demand Instances are used in the
                   game server group. No Spot Instances are  used,  even  when
                   available, while this balancing strategy is in force.

              GameServerProtectionPolicy -> (string)
                 A  flag  that  indicates whether instances in the game server
                 group are protected from early termination.  Unprotected  in-
                 stances that have active game servers running might be termi-
                 nated during  a  scale-down  event,  causing  players  to  be
                 dropped  from  the game. Protected instances cannot be termi-
                 nated while there are active game servers running  except  in
                 the  event  of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An
                 exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be termi-
                 nated by AWS regardless of protection status.

              AutoScalingGroupArn -> (string)
                 A  generated unique ID for the EC2 Auto Scaling group that is
                 associated with this game server group.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status of the game server  group.  Possible  sta-
                 tuses include:

                 o NEW  - GameLift FleetIQ has validated the CreateGameServer-
                   Group() request.

                 o ACTIVATING - GameLift FleetIQ is setting up a  game  server
                   group,  which  includes  creating  an Auto Scaling group in
                   your AWS account.

                 o ACTIVE - The game server group has been  successfully  cre-
                   ated.

                 o DELETE_SCHEDULED  -  A  request  to  delete the game server
                   group has been received.

                 o DELETING  -  GameLift  FleetIQ   has   received   a   valid
                   DeleteGameServerGroup()   request  and  is  processing  it.
                   GameLift FleetIQ must first complete and release hosts  be-
                   fore  it deletes the Auto Scaling group and the game server
                   group.

                 o DELETED - The  game  server  group  has  been  successfully
                   deleted.

                 o ERROR  - The asynchronous processes of activating or delet-
                   ing a game server group has failed, resulting in  an  error
                   state.

              StatusReason -> (string)
                 Additional  information  about  the current game server group
                 status. This information might provide additional insight  on
                 groups that are in ERROR status.

              SuspendedActions -> (list)
                 A  list  of  activities that are currently suspended for this
                 game server group. If this property is empty, all  activities
                 are occurring.

                 (string)

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  time  stamp  indicating when this data object was created.
                 Format is a number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  timestamp  that  indicates when this game server group was
                 last updated.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates where to resume  retrieving  results  on  the
          next  call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results
          represent the end of the list.
