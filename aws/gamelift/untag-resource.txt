UNTAG-RESOURCE()                                              UNTAG-RESOURCE()



NAME
       untag-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  a  tag  that is assigned to a GameLift resource. Resource tags
       are used to organize AWS resources for a range of purposes. This opera-
       tion handles the permissions necessary to manage tags for the following
       GameLift resource types:

       o Build

       o Script

       o Fleet

       o Alias

       o GameSessionQueue

       o MatchmakingConfiguration

       o MatchmakingRuleSet

       To remove a tag from a resource, specify the unique ARN value  for  the
       resource  and  provide  a string list containing one or more tags to be
       removed. This operation succeeds even if the list  includes  tags  that
       are not currently assigned to the specified resource.

SYNOPSIS
            untag-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          --tag-keys <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is  assigned  to  and  uniquely
          identifies  the GameLift resource that you want to remove tags from.
          GameLift resource ARNs are included in the data object for  the  re-
          source,  which can be retrieved by calling a List or Describe opera-
          tion for the resource type.

       --tag-keys (list)
          A list of one or more tag keys to remove from the specified GameLift
          resource.  An AWS resource can have only one tag with a specific tag
          key, so specifying the tag key identifies which tag to remove.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
