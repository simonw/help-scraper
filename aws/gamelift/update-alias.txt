NAME
       update-alias -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  properties  for  an  alias.  To update properties, specify the
       alias ID to be updated and provide the information to  be  changed.  To
       reassign  an  alias to another fleet, provide an updated routing strat-
       egy. If successful, the updated alias record is returned.

SYNOPSIS
            update-alias
          --alias-id <value>
          [--name <value>]
          [--description <value>]
          [--routing-strategy <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --alias-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the alias that you want to update. You can
          use either the alias ID or ARN value.

       --name (string)
          A descriptive label that is associated with an alias. Alias names do
          not need to be unique.

       --description (string)
          A human-readable description of the alias.

       --routing-strategy (structure)
          The  routing configuration, including routing type and fleet target,
          for the alias.

          Type -> (string)
              The type of routing strategy for the alias.

              Possible routing types include the following:

              o SIMPLE - The alias resolves to one specific  fleet.  Use  this
                type when routing to active fleets.

              o TERMINAL  -  The alias does not resolve to a fleet but instead
                can be used to display a message to the user. A terminal alias
                throws  a  TerminalRoutingStrategyException  with  the   Rout-
                ingStrategy message embedded.

          FleetId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the fleet that the alias points to. This
              value is the fleet ID, not the fleet ARN.

          Message -> (string)
              The message text to be used with a terminal routing strategy.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,FleetId=string,Message=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Type": "SIMPLE"|"TERMINAL",
            "FleetId": "string",
            "Message": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Alias -> (structure)
          The updated alias resource.

          AliasId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the alias. Alias IDs are unique within a
              Region.

          Name -> (string)
              A descriptive label that is  associated  with  an  alias.  Alias
              names do not need to be unique.

          AliasArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a GameLift
              alias resource and  uniquely  identifies  it.  ARNs  are  unique
              across    all    Regions.    Format   is   arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
              gion>::alias/alias-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912 .  In  a
              GameLift alias ARN, the resource ID matches the alias ID value.

          Description -> (string)
              A human-readable description of an alias.

          RoutingStrategy -> (structure)
              The routing configuration, including routing type and fleet tar-
              get, for the alias.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of routing strategy for the alias.

                 Possible routing types include the following:

                 o SIMPLE - The alias resolves to one specific fleet. Use this
                   type when routing to active fleets.

                 o TERMINAL  -  The  alias does not resolve to a fleet but in-
                   stead can be used to display a message to the user. A  ter-
                   minal  alias throws a TerminalRoutingStrategyException with
                   the  RoutingStrategy message embedded.

              FleetId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the fleet that the alias  points  to.
                 This value is the fleet ID, not the fleet ARN.

              Message -> (string)
                 The message text to be used with a terminal routing strategy.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A  time stamp indicating when this data object was created. For-
              mat is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for  ex-
              ample "1469498468.057" ).

          LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
              The  time  that  this data object was last modified. Format is a
              number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds  (for  example
              "1469498468.057" ).
