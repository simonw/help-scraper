DESCRIBE-GAME-SERVER()                                  DESCRIBE-GAME-SERVER()



NAME
       describe-game-server -

DESCRIPTION
          This  operation  is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game
          server groups.

       Retrieves information for a registered  game  server.  Information  in-
       cludes game server status, health check info, and the instance that the
       game server is running on.

       To retrieve game server information, specify the  game  server  ID.  If
       successful, the requested game server object is returned.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-game-server
          --game-server-group-name <value>
          --game-server-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --game-server-group-name (string)
          A  unique identifier for the game server group where the game server
          is running. Use either the  GameServerGroup name or ARN value.

       --game-server-id (string)
          A custom string that uniquely identifies the game server information
          to be retrieved.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GameServer -> (structure)
          Object that describes the requested game server.

          GameServerGroupName -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the game server  group  where  the  game
              server  is  running. Use either the  GameServerGroup name or ARN
              value.

          GameServerGroupArn -> (string)
              The ARN identifier for the game  server  group  where  the  game
              server is located.

          GameServerId -> (string)
              A  custom  string that uniquely identifies the game server. Game
              server IDs are developer-defined and are unique across all  game
              server groups in an Amazon Web Services account.

          InstanceId -> (string)
              The  unique identifier for the instance where the game server is
              running. This ID is available in the instance metadata. EC2  in-
              stance   IDs   use   a   17-character   format,   for   example:
              i-1234567890abcdef0 .

          ConnectionInfo -> (string)
              The port and IP address that must be used to establish a  client
              connection to the game server.

          GameServerData -> (string)
              A  set  of  custom game server properties, formatted as a single
              string value. This data is passed to a game  client  or  service
              when  it  requests  information on game servers using  ListGame-
              Servers or  ClaimGameServer .

          ClaimStatus -> (string)
              Indicates when an available game server has  been  reserved  for
              gameplay  but  has  not  yet  started hosting a game. Once it is
              claimed, the game server remains in CLAIMED status for a maximum
              of  one  minute.  During  this time, game clients connect to the
              game server to start the game and trigger the game server to up-
              date  its  utilization status. After one minute, the game server
              claim status reverts to null.

          UtilizationStatus -> (string)
              Indicates whether the game server is currently available for new
              games or is busy. Possible statuses include:

              o AVAILABLE - The game server is available to be claimed. A game
                server that has been claimed remains in this status  until  it
                reports game hosting activity.

              o UTILIZED - The game server is currently hosting a game session
                with players.

          RegistrationTime -> (timestamp)
              Timestamp that indicates when the game server was created with a
              RegisterGameServer  request. The format is a number expressed in
              Unix time as milliseconds (for example "1469498468.057" ).

          LastClaimTime -> (timestamp)
              Timestamp that indicates the  last  time  the  game  server  was
              claimed  with a  ClaimGameServer request. The format is a number
              expressed  in   Unix   time   as   milliseconds   (for   example
              "1469498468.057"  ).  This  value  is  used  to calculate when a
              claimed game server's status should revert to null.

          LastHealthCheckTime -> (timestamp)
              Timestamp that indicates the last time the game server  was  up-
              dated with health status using an  UpdateGameServer request. The
              format is a number expressed in Unix time as  milliseconds  (for
              example "1469498468.057" ). After game server registration, this
              property is only changed when a game server update  specifies  a
              health check value.
