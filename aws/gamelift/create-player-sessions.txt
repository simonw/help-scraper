CREATE-PLAYER-SESSIONS()                              CREATE-PLAYER-SESSIONS()



NAME
       create-player-sessions -

DESCRIPTION
       Reserves  open  slots  in  a  game  session for a group of players. New
       player sessions can be created in any game session with  an  open  slot
       that is in ACTIVE status and has a player creation policy of ACCEPT_ALL
       . To add a single player to a game session, use  CreatePlayerSession .

       To create player sessions, specify a game session  ID  and  a  list  of
       player  IDs.  Optionally,  provide a set of player data for each player
       ID.

       If successful, a slot is reserved in the game session for each  player,
       and  new   PlayerSession  objects are returned with player session IDs.
       Each player references their player session ID when sending  a  connec-
       tion  request  to  the  game session, and the game server can use it to
       validate the player reservation with the GameLift service. Player  ses-
       sions cannot be updated.

       The  maximum  number  of players per game session is 200. It is not ad-
       justable.
          Available in Amazon GameLift Local.

OPTIONS
       --game-session-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the game session to add players to.

       --player-ids (list)
          List of unique identifiers for the players to be added.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --player-data-map (map)
          Map of string pairs, each specifying a player ID and a set of devel-
          oper-defined information related to the player. Amazon GameLift does
          not use this data, so it can be formatted as needed for use  in  the
          game.  Any  player data strings for player IDs that are not included
          in the PlayerIds parameter are ignored.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       PlayerSessions -> (list)
          A  collection  of player session objects created for the added play-
          ers.

          (structure)
              Represents a player session. Player sessions are created  either
              for a specific game session, or as part of a game session place-
              ment or matchmaking request. A player session can  represents  a
              reserved  player slot in a game session (when status is RESERVED
              ) or actual player activity in a game session  (when  status  is
              ACTIVE ). A player session object, including player data, is au-
              tomatically passed to a game session when the player connects to
              the  game session and is validated. After the game session ends,
              player sessions information is retained for 30 days and then re-
              moved.

                 A unique identifier for a player session.

              PlayerId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for a player that is associated with this
                 player session.

              GameSessionId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the game session that the player ses-
                 sion is connected to.

              FleetId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the fleet that the player's game ses-
                 sion is running on.

              FleetArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) associated with the  GameLift
                 fleet that the player's game session is running on.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  time  stamp  indicating when this data object was created.
                 Format is a number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              TerminationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A time stamp indicating when this data object was terminated.
                 Format is a number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              Status -> (string)
                 Current status of the player session.

                 Possible player session statuses include the following:

                 o RESERVED  --  The player session request has been received,
                   but the player has not yet connected to the server  process
                   and/or been validated.

                 o ACTIVE  --  The  player  has  been  validated by the server
                   process and is currently connected.

                 o COMPLETED -- The player connection has been dropped.

                 o TIMEDOUT -- A player session request was received, but  the
                   player  did not connect and/or was not validated within the
                   timeout limit (60 seconds).

              IpAddress -> (string)
                 The IP address of the game session. To connect to a  GameLift
                 game  server,  an app needs both the IP address and port num-
                 ber.

              DnsName -> (string)
                 The DNS identifier assigned to the instance that  is  running
                 the game session. Values have the following format:

                 o TLS-enabled  fleets:  <unique  identifier>.<region  identi-
                   fier>.amazongamelift.com .

                 o Non-TLS-enabled   fleets:   ec2-<unique    identifier>.com-
                   pute.amazonaws.com . (See Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing
                   .)

                 When connecting to a  game  session  that  is  running  on  a
                 TLS-enabled  fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the IP ad-
                 dress.

              Port -> (integer)
                 Port number for the game session.  To  connect  to  a  Amazon
                 GameLift server process, an app needs both the IP address and
                 port number.

              PlayerData -> (string)
                 Developer-defined information related to a  player.  GameLift
                 does  not use this data, so it can be formatted as needed for
                 use in the game.
