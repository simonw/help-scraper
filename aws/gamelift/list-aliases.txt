NAME
       list-aliases -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  all  aliases  for  this Amazon Web Services account. You can
       filter the result set by alias name and/or routing strategy  type.  Use
       the pagination parameters to retrieve results in sequential pages.

       NOTE:
              Returned aliases are not listed in any particular order.

       list-aliases is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: Aliases

SYNOPSIS
            list-aliases
          [--routing-strategy-type <value>]
          [--name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --routing-strategy-type (string)
          The  routing  type  to  filter results on. Use this parameter to re-
          trieve only aliases with a certain routing  type.  To  retrieve  all
          aliases, leave this parameter empty.

          Possible routing types include the following:

          o SIMPLE  -- The alias resolves to one specific fleet. Use this type
            when routing to active fleets.

          o TERMINAL -- The alias does not resolve to a fleet but instead  can
            be  used to display a message to the user. A terminal alias throws
            a TerminalRoutingStrategyException with the  RoutingStrategy  mes-
            sage embedded.

          Possible values:

          o SIMPLE

          o TERMINAL

       --name (string)
          A descriptive label that is associated with an alias. Alias names do
          not need to be unique.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Aliases -> (list)
          A collection of alias resources that match the request parameters.

          (structure)
              Properties that describe an alias resource.

                     dateAlias  |   DeleteAlias  |  ResolveAlias | All APIs by
                     task

              AliasId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for  the  alias.  Alias  IDs  are  unique
                 within a Region.

              Name -> (string)
                 A  descriptive  label that is associated with an alias. Alias
                 names do not need to be unique.

              AliasArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN  )  that  is  assigned  to  a
                 GameLift  alias resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are
                 unique across all Regions.  Format  is  arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
                 gion>::alias/alias-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912  . In
                 a GameLift alias ARN, the resource ID matches  the  alias  ID
                 value.

              Description -> (string)
                 A human-readable description of an alias.

              RoutingStrategy -> (structure)
                 The  routing  configuration, including routing type and fleet
                 target, for the alias.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of routing strategy for the alias.

                     Possible routing types include the following:

                     o SIMPLE - The alias resolves to one specific fleet.  Use
                       this type when routing to active fleets.

                     o TERMINAL  -  The  alias does not resolve to a fleet but
                       instead can be used to display a message to the user. A
                       terminal  alias  throws a TerminalRoutingStrategyExcep-
                       tion with the  RoutingStrategy message embedded.

                 FleetId -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for the fleet that the  alias  points
                     to. This value is the fleet ID, not the fleet ARN.

                 Message -> (string)
                     The  message  text  to  be  used  with a terminal routing
                     strategy.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A time stamp indicating when this data  object  was  created.
                 Format  is  a  number  expressed in Unix time as milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that this data object was last modified. Format is a
                 number  expressed  in  Unix time as milliseconds (for example
                 "1469498468.057" ).

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates where to resume  retrieving  results  on  the
          next  call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results
          represent the end of the list.
