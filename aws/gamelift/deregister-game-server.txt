DEREGISTER-GAME-SERVER()                              DEREGISTER-GAME-SERVER()



NAME
       deregister-game-server -

DESCRIPTION
          This  operation  is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game
          server groups.

       Removes the game server from a game server group. As a result  of  this
       operation,  the  deregistered  game server can no longer be claimed and
       will not be returned in a list of active game servers.

       To deregister a game server, specify the game  server  group  and  game
       server  ID. If successful, this operation emits a CloudWatch event with
       termination timestamp and reason.

SYNOPSIS
            deregister-game-server
          --game-server-group-name <value>
          --game-server-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --game-server-group-name (string)
          A unique identifier for the game server group where the game  server
          is running. Use either the  GameServerGroup name or ARN value.

       --game-server-id (string)
          A custom string that uniquely identifies the game server to deregis-
          ter.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
