REQUEST-UPLOAD-CREDENTIALS()                      REQUEST-UPLOAD-CREDENTIALS()



NAME
       request-upload-credentials -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  fresh set of credentials for use when uploading a new set
       of game build files to Amazon Web Services's Amazon S3. This is done as
       part of the build creation process; see  CreateBuild .

       To  request  new  credentials, specify the build ID as returned with an
       initial CreateBuild request. If successful, a new  set  of  credentials
       are  returned,  along  with the S3 storage location associated with the
       build ID.

SYNOPSIS
            request-upload-credentials
          --build-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --build-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for the build to get credentials for. You can
          use either the build ID or ARN value.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To refresh access credentials for uploading a build

       The  following  create-build  example obtains new, valid access creden-
       tials for uploading a GameLift build file to  an  Amazon  S3  location.
       Credentials have a limited life span. You get the build ID from the re-
       sponse to the original CreateBuild request.

          aws gamelift request-upload-credentials \
              --build-id build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

       Output:

          {
              "StorageLocation": {
                  "Bucket": "gamelift-builds-us-west-2",
                  "Key": "123456789012/build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
              },
              "UploadCredentials": {
                  "AccessKeyId": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
                  "SecretAccessKey": "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY",

              }
          }

OUTPUT
       UploadCredentials -> (structure)
          Amazon Web Services credentials required when uploading a game build
          to the storage location. These credentials have a  limited  lifespan
          and are valid only for the build they were issued for.

          AccessKeyId -> (string)
              Temporary  key allowing access to the Amazon Web Services S3 ac-
              count.

          SecretAccessKey -> (string)
              Temporary secret key allowing access to the Amazon Web  Services
              S3 account.

          SessionToken -> (string)
              Token  used  to associate a specific build ID with the files up-
              loaded using these credentials.

       StorageLocation -> (structure)
          Amazon S3 path and key, identifying where the game build  files  are
          stored.

          Bucket -> (string)
              An  Amazon  S3  bucket  identifier.  This  is the name of the S3
              bucket.

              NOTE:
                 GameLift currently does not support uploading from Amazon  S3
                 buckets with names that contain a dot (.).

          Key -> (string)
              The name of the zip file that contains the build files or script
              files.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) for an IAM role that allows Ama-
              zon Web Services to access the S3 bucket.

          ObjectVersion -> (string)
              The  version  of the file, if object versioning is turned on for
              the bucket. Amazon Web Services uses this information  when  re-
              trieving  files from an S3 bucket that you own. Use this parame-
              ter to specify a specific version of the file. If not  set,  the
              latest version of the file is retrieved.
