UPDATE-GAME-SERVER-GROUP()                          UPDATE-GAME-SERVER-GROUP()



NAME
       update-game-server-group -

DESCRIPTION
          This  operation  is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game
          server groups.

       Updates GameLift FleetIQ-specific properties for a game  server  group.
       Many  Auto  Scaling  group  properties  are updated on the Auto Scaling
       group directly, including the launch template, Auto  Scaling  policies,
       and maximum/minimum/desired instance counts.

       To  update  the game server group, specify the game server group ID and
       provide the updated values. Before applying the updates, the new values
       are  validated  to ensure that GameLift FleetIQ can continue to perform
       instance balancing activity. If successful, a   GameServerGroup  object
       is returned.

OPTIONS
       --game-server-group-name (string)
          A unique identifier for the game server group. Use either the  Game-
          ServerGroup name or ARN value.

       --role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN ) for an IAM role that allows Amazon
          GameLift to access your Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups.

       --instance-definitions (list)
          An updated list of Amazon EC2 instance types  to  use  in  the  Auto
          Scaling  group.  The  instance definitions must specify at least two
          different instance types that are  supported  by  GameLift  FleetIQ.
          This updated list replaces the entire current list of instance defi-
          nitions for the game server group. For more information on  instance
          types, see EC2 Instance Types in the Amazon EC2 User Guide . You can
          optionally specify capacity weighting for each instance type. If  no
          weight value is specified for an instance type, it is set to the de-
          fault value "1". For more information about capacity weighting,  see
          Instance  Weighting  for  Amazon  EC2 Auto Scaling in the Amazon EC2
          Auto Scaling User Guide.

          (structure)
                 This data type is used with the  GameLift  FleetIQ  and  game
                 server groups.

              An  allowed  instance  type  for  a   GameServerGroup . All game
              server groups must have at least two instance types defined  for
              it.  GameLift  FleetIQ  periodically  evaluates each defined in-
              stance type for viability. It  then  updates  the  Auto  Scaling
              group with the list of viable instance types.

              InstanceType -> (string)
                 An Amazon EC2 instance type designation.

              WeightedCapacity -> (string)
                 Instance weighting that indicates how much this instance type
                 contributes to the total capacity of a game server group. In-
                 stance  weights are used by GameLift FleetIQ to calculate the
                 instance type's cost per unit hour and  better  identify  the
                 most  cost-effective  options.  For  detailed  information on
                 weighting instance capacity, see Instance  Weighting  in  the
                 Amazon  Elastic  Compute  Cloud Auto Scaling User Guide . De-
                 fault value is "1".

            ...
          ]

       --game-server-protection-policy (string)
          A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are
          protected  from  early  termination. Unprotected instances that have
          active game servers running might be terminated during a  scale-down
          event,  causing  players  to be dropped from the game. Protected in-
          stances cannot be terminated while there  are  active  game  servers
          running  except  in the event of a forced game server group deletion
          (see ). An exception to this is with Spot Instances,  which  can  be
          terminated  by  Amazon Web Services regardless of protection status.
          This property is set to NO_PROTECTION by default.

          Possible values:

          o NO_PROTECTION

          o FULL_PROTECTION

       --balancing-strategy (string)
          Indicates how GameLift FleetIQ balances the use  of  Spot  Instances
          and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options in-
          clude the following:

          o SPOT_ONLY - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group.
            If  Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting,
            the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot  In-
            stances  can  again  be  used.  Until  then,  no new instances are
            started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are  terminated
            (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced.

          o SPOT_PREFERRED  - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever
            available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavail-
            able,  the game server group continues to provide hosting capacity
            by falling back to On-Demand Instances.  Existing  nonviable  Spot
            Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are re-
            placed with new On-Demand Instances.

          o ON_DEMAND_ONLY - Only On-Demand Instances are  used  in  the  game
            server  group.  No  Spot  Instances are used, even when available,
            while this balancing strategy is in force.

          Possible values:

          o SPOT_ONLY

          o SPOT_PREFERRED

          o ON_DEMAND_ONLY

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

OUTPUT
       GameServerGroup -> (structure)
          An object that describes the game server group resource with updated
          properties.

          GameServerGroupName -> (string)
              A developer-defined identifier for the game  server  group.  The
              name  is  unique for each Region in each Amazon Web Services ac-
              count.

          GameServerGroupArn -> (string)
              A generated unique ID for the game server group.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) for an IAM role that allows Ama-
              zon GameLift to access your Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups.

          InstanceDefinitions -> (list)
              The  set  of Amazon EC2 instance types that GameLift FleetIQ can
              use when balancing and automatically scaling  instances  in  the
              corresponding Auto Scaling group.

              (structure)
                     This data type is used with the GameLift FleetIQ and game
                     server groups.

                 An allowed instance type for a  GameServerGroup  .  All  game
                 server  groups  must have at least two instance types defined
                 for it. GameLift FleetIQ periodically evaluates each  defined
                 instance type for viability. It then updates the Auto Scaling
                 group with the list of viable instance types.

                 InstanceType -> (string)
                     An Amazon EC2 instance type designation.

                 WeightedCapacity -> (string)
                     Instance weighting that indicates how much this  instance
                     type  contributes  to the total capacity of a game server
                     group. Instance weights are used by GameLift  FleetIQ  to
                     calculate the instance type's cost per unit hour and bet-
                     ter identify the most  cost-effective  options.  For  de-
                     tailed  information  on  weighting instance capacity, see
                     Instance Weighting in the Amazon  Elastic  Compute  Cloud
                     Auto Scaling User Guide . Default value is "1".

          BalancingStrategy -> (string)
              Indicates  how  GameLift  FleetIQ  balances  the use of Spot In-
              stances and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method
              options include the following:

              o SPOT_ONLY  -  Only  Spot Instances are used in the game server
                group. If Spot Instances are unavailable  or  not  viable  for
                game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capac-
                ity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new
                instances  are  started,  and  the existing nonviable Spot In-
                stances are terminated (after current gameplay ends)  and  are
                not replaced.

              o SPOT_PREFERRED - (default value) Spot Instances are used when-
                ever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are
                unavailable,  the game server group continues to provide host-
                ing capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances.  Existing
                nonviable  Spot  Instances are terminated (after current game-
                play ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances.

              o ON_DEMAND_ONLY - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game
                server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available,
                while this balancing strategy is in force.

          GameServerProtectionPolicy -> (string)
              A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group
              are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that
              have active game servers running might be  terminated  during  a
              scale-down  event,  causing players to be dropped from the game.
              Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are  active
              game servers running except in the event of a forced game server
              group deletion (see ). An exception to this  is  with  Spot  In-
              stances,  which can be terminated by Amazon Web Services regard-
              less of protection status.

          AutoScalingGroupArn -> (string)
              A generated unique ID for the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group that
              is associated with this game server group.

          Status -> (string)
              The  current  status of the game server group. Possible statuses
              include:

              o NEW - GameLift FleetIQ  has  validated  the  CreateGameServer-
                Group() request.

              o ACTIVATING  -  GameLift  FleetIQ  is  setting up a game server
                group, which includes creating an Auto Scaling group  in  your
                Amazon Web Services account.

              o ACTIVE - The game server group has been successfully created.

              o DELETE_SCHEDULED  -  A request to delete the game server group
                has been received.

              o DELETING - GameLift FleetIQ has received a  valid  DeleteGame-
                ServerGroup()  request  and is processing it. GameLift FleetIQ
                must first complete and release hosts before  it  deletes  the
                Auto Scaling group and the game server group.

              o DELETED - The game server group has been successfully deleted.

              o ERROR - The asynchronous processes of activating or deleting a
                game server group has failed, resulting in an error state.

          StatusReason -> (string)
              Additional information about the current game server group  sta-
              tus. This information might provide additional insight on groups
              that are in ERROR status.

          SuspendedActions -> (list)
              A list of activities that are currently suspended for this  game
              server  group. If this property is empty, all activities are oc-
              curring.

              (string)

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A time stamp indicating when this data object was created.  For-
              mat  is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for ex-
              ample "1469498468.057" ).

          LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp that indicates when this game server group was  last
              updated.
