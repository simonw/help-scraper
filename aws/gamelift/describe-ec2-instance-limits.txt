DESCRIPTION
       The  GameLift  service limits and current utilization for an AWS Region
       or location. Instance limits control the number of instances,  per  in-
       stance type, per location, that your AWS account can use. Learn more at
       Amazon EC2 Instance Types . The information returned includes the maxi-
       mum number of instances allowed and your account's current usage across
       all fleets. This information can affect  your  ability  to  scale  your
       GameLift  fleets.  You can request a limit increase for your account by
       using the Service limits page in the GameLift console.

       Instance limits differ based on whether the instances are deployed in a
       fleet's home Region or in a remote location. For remote locations, lim-
       its also differ based on the combination of home Region and remote  lo-
       cation.  All  requests must specify an AWS Region (either explicitly or
       as your default settings). To get the limit for a remote location,  you
       must also specify the location. For example, the following requests all
       return different results:

       o Request specifies the Region ap-northeast-1 with no location. The re-
         sult is limits and usage data on all instance types that are deployed
         in us-east-2 , by all of the fleets that reside in ap-northeast-1 .

       o Request specifies the Region us-east-1 with location  ca-central-1  .
         The  result  is  limits and usage data on all instance types that are
         deployed in ca-central-1 , by  all  of  the  fleets  that  reside  in
         us-east-2  .  These  limits do not affect fleets in any other Regions
         that deploy instances to ca-central-1 .

       o Request specifies the Region eu-west-1 with location  ca-central-1  .
         The  result  is  limits and usage data on all instance types that are
         deployed in ca-central-1 , by  all  of  the  fleets  that  reside  in
         eu-west-1 .

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To  get limit and usage data for all instance types that are deployed
         in an AWS Region by fleets that reside in the  same  Region:  Specify
         the  Region  only.  Optionally, specify a single instance type to re-
         trieve information for.

       o To get limit and usage data for all instance types that are  deployed
         to  a  remote location by fleets that reside in different AWS Region:
         Provide both the AWS Region  and  the  remote  location.  Optionally,
         specify a single instance type to retrieve information for.

       If  successful, an EC2InstanceLimits object is returned with limits and
       usage data for each requested instance type.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-ec2-instance-limits
          [--ec2-instance-type <value>]
          [--location <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]

OPTIONS
       --ec2-instance-type (string)
          Name  of an EC2 instance type that is supported in GameLift. A fleet
          instance type determines the computing resources of each instance in
          the  fleet, including CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.
          Do not specify a value for this parameter to retrieve limits for all
          instance types.

       --location (string)
          The name of a remote location to request instance limits for, in the
          form of an AWS Region code such as us-west-2 .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve service limits for an EC2 instance type

       The following describe-ec2-instance-limits example displays the maximum
       allowed instances and current instances in use for  the  specified  EC2
       instance  type  in  the  current Region. The result indicates that only
       five of the allowed twenty instances are being used.

          aws gamelift describe-ec2-instance-limits \
              --ec2-instance-type m5.large

       Output:

          {
              "EC2InstanceLimits": [
                  {
                      "EC2InstanceType": ""m5.large",
                      "CurrentInstances": 5,
                      "InstanceLimit": 20
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       EC2InstanceLimits -> (list)
          The maximum number of instances for the specified instance type.

          (structure)
              The GameLift service limits for an EC2 instance type and current
              utilization. GameLift allows AWS accounts a  maximum  number  of
              instances,  per  instance  type, per AWS Region or location, for
              use with GameLift. You can request an limit  increase  for  your
              account  by  using  the Service limits page in the GameLift con-
              sole.
