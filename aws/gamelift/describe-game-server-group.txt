NAME
       describe-game-server-group -

DESCRIPTION
          This  operation  is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game
          server groups.

       Retrieves information on a game server group.  This  operation  returns
       only  properties related to GameLift FleetIQ. To view or update proper-
       ties for the corresponding Auto Scaling group, such as launch template,
       auto  scaling policies, and maximum/minimum group size, access the Auto
       Scaling group directly.

       To get attributes for a game server group, provide a group name or  ARN
       value. If successful, a  GameServerGroup object is returned.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-game-server-group
          --game-server-group-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --game-server-group-name (string)
          A unique identifier for the game server group. Use either the  Game-
          ServerGroup name or ARN value.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GameServerGroup -> (structure)
          An object with the property settings for the requested  game  server
          group resource.

          GameServerGroupName -> (string)
              A  developer-defined  identifier  for the game server group. The
              name is unique for each Region in each AWS account.

          GameServerGroupArn -> (string)
              A generated unique ID for the game server group.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) for an IAM role that allows Ama-
              zon GameLift to access your EC2 Auto Scaling groups.

          InstanceDefinitions -> (list)
              The set of EC2 instance types that GameLift FleetIQ can use when
              balancing and automatically scaling instances in the correspond-
              ing Auto Scaling group.

              (structure)
                     This data type is used with the GameLift FleetIQ and game
                     server groups.

                 An allowed instance type for a  GameServerGroup  .  All  game
                 server  groups  must have at least two instance types defined
                 for it. GameLift FleetIQ periodically evaluates each  defined
                 instance type for viability. It then updates the Auto Scaling
                 group with the list of viable instance types.

                 InstanceType -> (string)
                     An EC2 instance type designation.

                 WeightedCapacity -> (string)
                     Instance weighting that indicates how much this  instance
                     type  contributes  to the total capacity of a game server
                     group. Instance weights are used by GameLift  FleetIQ  to
                     calculate the instance type's cost per unit hour and bet-
                     ter identify the most  cost-effective  options.  For  de-
                     tailed  information  on  weighting instance capacity, see
                     Instance Weighting in the Amazon EC2  Auto  Scaling  User
                     Guide . Default value is "1".

          BalancingStrategy -> (string)
              Indicates  how  GameLift  FleetIQ  balances  the use of Spot In-
              stances and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method
              options include the following:

              o SPOT_ONLY  -  Only  Spot Instances are used in the game server
                group. If Spot Instances are unavailable  or  not  viable  for
                game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capac-
                ity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new
                instances  are  started,  and  the existing nonviable Spot In-
                stances are terminated (after current gameplay ends)  and  are
                not replaced.

              o SPOT_PREFERRED - (default value) Spot Instances are used when-
                ever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are
                unavailable,  the game server group continues to provide host-
                ing capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances.  Existing
                nonviable  Spot  Instances are terminated (after current game-
                play ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances.

              o ON_DEMAND_ONLY - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game
                server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available,
                while this balancing strategy is in force.

          GameServerProtectionPolicy -> (string)
              A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group
              are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that
              have active game servers running might be  terminated  during  a
              scale-down  event,  causing players to be dropped from the game.
              Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are  active
              game servers running except in the event of a forced game server
              group deletion (see ). An exception to this  is  with  Spot  In-
              stances, which can be terminated by AWS regardless of protection
              status.

          AutoScalingGroupArn -> (string)
              A generated unique ID for the EC2 Auto Scaling group that is as-
              sociated with this game server group.

          Status -> (string)
              The  current  status of the game server group. Possible statuses
              include:

              o NEW - GameLift FleetIQ  has  validated  the  CreateGameServer-
                Group() request.

              o ACTIVATING  -  GameLift  FleetIQ  is  setting up a game server
                group, which includes creating an Auto Scaling group  in  your
                AWS account.

              o ACTIVE - The game server group has been successfully created.

              o DELETE_SCHEDULED  -  A request to delete the game server group
                has been received.

              o DELETING - GameLift FleetIQ has received a  valid  DeleteGame-
                ServerGroup()  request  and is processing it. GameLift FleetIQ
                must first complete and release hosts before  it  deletes  the
                Auto Scaling group and the game server group.

              o DELETED - The game server group has been successfully deleted.

              o ERROR - The asynchronous processes of activating or deleting a
                game server group has failed, resulting in an error state.

          StatusReason -> (string)
              Additional information about the current game server group  sta-
              tus. This information might provide additional insight on groups
              that are in ERROR status.

          SuspendedActions -> (list)
              A list of activities that are currently suspended for this  game
              server  group. If this property is empty, all activities are oc-
              curring.

              (string)

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A time stamp indicating when this data object was created.  For-
              mat  is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for ex-
              ample "1469498468.057" ).

          LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp that indicates when this game server group was  last
              updated.
