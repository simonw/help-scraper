CREATE-FLEET-LOCATIONS()                              CREATE-FLEET-LOCATIONS()



NAME
       create-fleet-locations -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  remote  locations  to a fleet and begins populating the new loca-
       tions with EC2 instances. The new instances conform to the fleet's  in-
       stance type, auto-scaling, and other configuration settings.

       NOTE:
          This  operation cannot be used with fleets that don't support remote
          locations. Fleets can have multiple locations only if they reside in
          AWS Regions that support this feature (see  CreateFleet for the com-
          plete list) and were created after the feature was released in March
          2021.

       To  add  fleet locations, specify the fleet to be updated and provide a
       list of one or more locations.

       If successful, this operation returns the list of added locations  with
       their status set to NEW . GameLift initiates the process of starting an
       instance in each added location. You can track the status of  each  new
       location   by   monitoring   location   creation   events   using   De-
       scribeFleetEvents . Alternatively, you  can  poll  location  status  by
       calling   DescribeFleetLocationAttributes . After a location status be-
       comes ACTIVE , you can adjust the location's capacity  as  needed  with
       UpdateFleetCapacity .

SYNOPSIS
            create-fleet-locations
          --fleet-id <value>
          --locations <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the fleet to add locations to. You can use
          either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --locations (list)
          A list of locations to deploy additional instances to and manage  as
          part  of the fleet. You can add any GameLift-supported AWS Region as
          a remote location, in the  form  of  an  AWS  Region  code  such  as
          us-west-2 .

          (structure)
              A  remote  location  where a multi-location fleet can deploy EC2
              instances for game hosting.

              Location -> (string)
                 An AWS Region code, such as us-west-2 .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Location=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Location": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FleetId -> (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for the fleet that was updated with new loca-
          tions.

       FleetArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a GameLift fleet
          resource  and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Re-
          gions.           Format           is           arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
          gion>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912 .

       LocationStates -> (list)
          The  remote  locations  that  are  being added to the fleet, and the
          life-cycle status of each location. For new locations, the status is
          set  to  NEW . During location creation, GameLift updates each loca-
          tion's status as instances are deployed there and prepared for  game
          hosting. This list does not include the fleet home Region or any re-
          mote locations that were already added to the fleet.

          (structure)
              A fleet location and its life-cycle state. A location state  ob-
              ject might be used to describe a fleet's remote location or home
              Region. Life-cycle state tracks the progress  of  launching  the
              first instance in a new location and preparing it for game host-
              ing, and then removing all instances and deleting  the  location
              from the fleet.

              Status -> (string)
