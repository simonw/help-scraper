NAME
       describe-vpc-peering-connections -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information on VPC peering connections. Use this operation to
       get peering information for all fleets or for one specific fleet ID.

       To retrieve connection information, call this operation from the Amazon
       Web  Services  account  that  is used to manage the Amazon Web Services
       fleets. Specify a fleet ID or leave the parameter empty to retrieve all
       connection  records.  If successful, the retrieved information includes
       both active and pending connections. Active  connections  identify  the
       IpV4 CIDR block that the VPC uses to connect.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-vpc-peering-connections
          [--fleet-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet. You can use either the  fleet  ID
          or ARN value.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       VpcPeeringConnections -> (list)
          A collection of VPC peering connection records that  match  the  re-
          quest.

          (structure)
              Represents  a  peering  connection  between a VPC on one of your
              Amazon Web Services accounts and the VPC  for  your  Amazon  Web
              Services  fleets.  This record may be for an active peering con-
              nection or a pending connection that has  not  yet  been  estab-
              lished.

              FleetId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the fleet. This ID determines the  ID
                 of the Amazon Web Services VPC for your fleet.

              FleetArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) associated with the GameLift
                 fleet resource for this connection.

              IpV4CidrBlock -> (string)
                 CIDR block of IPv4 addresses assigned to the VPC peering con-
                 nection for the GameLift VPC. The peered VPC also has an IPv4
                 CIDR block associated with it; these blocks cannot overlap or
                 the peering connection cannot be created.

              VpcPeeringConnectionId -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier  that  is automatically assigned to the
                 connection record. This ID is referenced in VPC peering  con-
                 nection  events,  and is used when deleting a connection with
                 DeleteVpcPeeringConnection .

              Status -> (structure)
                 The status information about the connection. Status indicates
                 if a connection is pending, successful, or failed.

                 Code -> (string)
                     Code indicating the status of a VPC peering connection.

                 Message -> (string)
                     Additional  messaging associated with the connection sta-
                     tus.

              PeerVpcId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for a VPC with resources to  be  accessed
                 by your GameLift fleet. The VPC must be in the same Region as
                 your fleet. To look up a VPC ID, use the VPC Dashboard in the
                 Amazon  Web Services Management Console. Learn more about VPC
                 peering in VPC Peering with GameLift Fleets .

              GameLiftVpcId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the VPC that contains the Amazon  Web
                 Services  fleet  for  this connection. This VPC is managed by
                 Amazon Web Services and does not appear in  your  Amazon  Web
                 Services account.
