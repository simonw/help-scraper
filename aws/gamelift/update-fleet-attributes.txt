          [--new-game-session-protection-policy <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique identifier for the fleet to update attribute metadata for.
          You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --name (string)
          A descriptive label that is associated with a fleet. Fleet names  do
          not need to be unique.

       --description (string)
          A human-readable description of a fleet.

       --new-game-session-protection-policy (string)
          The  game  session  protection  policy to apply to all new instances
          created in this fleet. Instances that  already  exist  are  not  af-
          fected.  You  can set protection for individual instances using  Up-
          dateGameSession .

          o NoProtection -- The  game  session  can  be  terminated  during  a
            scale-down event.

          o FullProtection  --  If the game session is in an ACTIVE status, it
            cannot be terminated during a scale-down event.

          Possible values:

          o NoProtection

          o FullProtection

       --resource-creation-limit-policy (structure)
          Policy settings that limit the number of game sessions an individual
          player can create over a span of time.

          NewGameSessionsPerCreator -> (integer)
              The  maximum number of game sessions that an individual can cre-
              ate during the policy period.

          PolicyPeriodInMinutes -> (integer)
              The time span used in evaluating  the  resource  creation  limit
              policy.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          NewGameSessionsPerCreator=integer,PolicyPeriodInMinutes=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "NewGameSessionsPerCreator": integer,
            "PolicyPeriodInMinutes": integer
          }

       --metric-groups (list)
          The  name of a metric group to add this fleet to. Use a metric group
          in Amazon CloudWatch to aggregate the metrics from multiple  fleets.
          Provide  an existing metric group name, or create a new metric group
          by providing a new name. A fleet can only be in one metric group  at
          a time.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FleetId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet that was updated.
