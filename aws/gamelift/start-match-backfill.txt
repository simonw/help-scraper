START-MATCH-BACKFILL()                                  START-MATCH-BACKFILL()



NAME
       start-match-backfill -

DESCRIPTION
       Finds  new  players  to  fill open slots in currently running game ses-
       sions. The backfill match  process  is  essentially  identical  to  the
       process  of  forming new matches. Backfill requests use the same match-
       maker that was used to make the original match, and they provide match-
       making  data  for  all players currently in the game session. FlexMatch
       uses this information to select new players so  that  backfilled  match
       continues to meet the original match requirements.

       When  using  FlexMatch with GameLift managed hosting, you can request a
       backfill match from a client service by calling this operation  with  a
       GameSession identifier. You also have the option of making backfill re-
       quests directly from your game server. In response to a request,  Flex-
       Match creates player sessions for the new players, updates the GameSes-
       sion resource, and sends updated matchmaking data to the  game  server.
       You  can  request a backfill match at any point after a game session is
       started. Each game session can have only one active backfill request at
       a  time;  a  subsequent  request automatically replaces the earlier re-
       quest.

       When using FlexMatch as a  standalone  component,  request  a  backfill
       match  by  calling this operation without a game session identifier. As
       with newly formed matches, matchmaking results are returned in a match-
       making  event so that your game can update the game session that is be-
       ing backfilled.

       To request a backfill match, specify a unique ticket ID,  the  original
       matchmaking configuration, and matchmaking data for all current players
       in the game session being backfilled. Optionally, specify the  GameSes-
       sion  ARN.  If  successful,  a match backfill ticket is created and re-
       turned with status set to QUEUED. Track the status of backfill  tickets
       using the same method for tracking tickets for new matches.

       Only  game  sessions created by FlexMatch are supported for match back-
       fill.

SYNOPSIS
            start-match-backfill
          [--ticket-id <value>]
          --configuration-name <value>
          [--game-session-arn <value>]
          --players <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --ticket-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for  a matchmaking ticket. If no ticket ID is
          specified here, Amazon Web Services will generate one in the form of
          a  UUID. Use this identifier to track the match backfill ticket sta-
          tus and retrieve match results.

       --configuration-name (string)
          Name of the matchmaker to use for this request. You can  use  either
          the  configuration name or ARN value. The ARN of the matchmaker that
          was used with the original game session is listed in  the   GameSes-
          sion object, MatchmakerData property.

       --game-session-arn (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the game session. Use the game session ID.
          When using FlexMatch as a standalone matchmaking solution, this  pa-
          rameter is not needed.

       --players (list)
          Match  information on all players that are currently assigned to the
          game session. This information is used by the matchmaker to find new
          players and add them to the existing game.

          o PlayerID, PlayerAttributes, Team -- This information is maintained
            in the  GameSession object, MatchmakerData property, for all play-
            ers who are currently assigned to the game session. The matchmaker
            data is in JSON syntax, formatted as a string. For  more  details,
            see  Match Data .  The backfill request must specify the team mem-
            bership for every player. Do not specify team if you are not using
            backfill.

          o LatencyInMs  --  If  the matchmaker uses player latency, include a
            latency value, in milliseconds, for the Region that the game  ses-
            sion  is currently in. Do not include latency values for any other
            Region.

          (structure)
              Represents a player in matchmaking. When starting a  matchmaking
              request,  a player has a player ID, attributes, and may have la-
              tency data. Team information is added after  a  match  has  been
              successfully completed.

              PlayerId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for a player

              PlayerAttributes -> (map)
                 A collection of key:value pairs containing player information
                 for use in matchmaking. Player attribute keys must match  the
                 playerAttributes  used  in  a  matchmaking rule set. Example:
                 "PlayerAttributes": {"skill": {"N": "23"}, "gameMode":  {"S":
                 "deathmatch"}} .

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     Values for use in  Player attribute key-value pairs. This
                     object lets you specify an attribute value using  any  of
                     the  valid  data  types: string, number, string array, or
                     data map. Each AttributeValue object can use only one  of
                     the available properties.

                     S -> (string)
                        For single string values. Maximum string length is 100
                        characters.

                     N -> (double)
                        For number values, expressed as double.

                     SL -> (list)
                        For a list of up to 100 strings.  Maximum  length  for
                        each  string  is  100 characters. Duplicate values are
                        not recognized; all occurrences of the repeated  value
                        after the first of a repeated value are ignored.

                        (string)

                     SDM -> (map)
                        For  a  map of up to 10 data type:value pairs. Maximum
                        length for each string value is 100 characters.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (double)

              Team -> (string)
                 Name of the team that the player is assigned to in  a  match.
                 Team names are defined in a matchmaking rule set.

              LatencyInMs -> (map)
                 A  set  of  values, expressed in milliseconds, that indicates
                 the amount of latency that a  player  experiences  when  con-
                 nected  to  @aws; Regions. If this property is present, Flex-
                 Match considers placing the match only in Regions  for  which
                 latency is reported.

                 If  a  matchmaker  has  a rule that evaluates player latency,
                 players must report latency in order to be matched. If no la-
                 tency is reported in this scenario, FlexMatch assumes that no
                 Regions are available to the player and  the  ticket  is  not
                 matchable.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (integer)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          PlayerId=string,PlayerAttributes={KeyName1={S=string,N=double,SL=[string,string],SDM={KeyName1=double,KeyName2=double}},KeyName2={S=string,N=double,SL=[string,string],SDM={KeyName1=double,KeyName2=double}}},Team=string,LatencyInMs={KeyName1=integer,KeyName2=integer} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "PlayerId": "string",
              "PlayerAttributes": {"string": {
                    "S": "string",
                    "N": double,
                    "SL": ["string", ...],
                    "SDM": {"string": double
                      ...}
                  }
                ...},
              "Team": "string",
              "LatencyInMs": {"string": integer
                ...}
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       MatchmakingTicket -> (structure)
          Ticket representing the backfill matchmaking  request.  This  object
          includes  the  information  in the request, ticket status, and match
          results as generated during the matchmaking process.

          TicketId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for a matchmaking ticket.

          ConfigurationName -> (string)
              Name of the  MatchmakingConfiguration that  is  used  with  this
              ticket.  Matchmaking  configurations  determine  how players are
              grouped into a match and how a new game session is  created  for
              the match.

          ConfigurationArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN ) associated with the GameLift
              matchmaking  configuration  resource  that  is  used  with  this
              ticket.

          Status -> (string)
              Current status of the matchmaking request.

              o QUEUED  --  The  matchmaking  request has been received and is
                currently waiting to be processed.

              o SEARCHING -- The matchmaking request is currently  being  pro-
                cessed.

              o REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE -- A match has been proposed and the play-
                ers must accept the match (see  AcceptMatch ). This status  is
                used  only  with requests that use a matchmaking configuration
                with a player acceptance requirement.

              o PLACING -- The FlexMatch engine has matched players and is  in
                the process of placing a new game session for the match.

              o COMPLETED  --  Players have been matched and a game session is
                ready to host the players. A ticket in this state contains the
                necessary connection information for players.

              o FAILED -- The matchmaking request was not completed.

              o CANCELLED -- The matchmaking request was canceled. This may be
                the result of a call to  StopMatchmaking or a  proposed  match
                that one or more players failed to accept.

              o TIMED_OUT -- The matchmaking request was not successful within
                the duration specified in the matchmaking configuration.

              NOTE:
                 Matchmaking requests that fail to successfully complete (sta-
                 tuses FAILED, CANCELLED, TIMED_OUT) can be resubmitted as new
                 requests with new ticket IDs.

          StatusReason -> (string)
              Code to explain the current status. For example, a status reason
              may  indicate when a ticket has returned to SEARCHING status af-
              ter a proposed match fails to receive player acceptances.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              Additional information about the current status.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              Time stamp indicating when  this  matchmaking  request  was  re-
              ceived.  Format  is a number expressed in Unix time as millisec-
              onds (for example "1469498468.057" ).

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              Time stamp indicating when this matchmaking request stopped  be-
              ing  processed  due to success, failure, or cancellation. Format
              is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for  example
              "1469498468.057" ).

          Players -> (list)
              A  set  of  Player  objects,  each representing a player to find
              matches for. Players are identified by a unique  player  ID  and
              may  include  latency  data  for  use during matchmaking. If the
              ticket is in status COMPLETED , the Player objects  include  the
              team the players were assigned to in the resulting match.

              (structure)
                 Represents a player in matchmaking. When starting a matchmak-
                 ing request, a player has a player ID,  attributes,  and  may
                 have  latency  data.  Team information is added after a match
                 has been successfully completed.

                 PlayerId -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for a player

                 PlayerAttributes -> (map)
                     A collection of key:value pairs containing player  infor-
                     mation for use in matchmaking. Player attribute keys must
                     match the playerAttributes used  in  a  matchmaking  rule
                     set.  Example: "PlayerAttributes": {"skill": {"N": "23"},
                     "gameMode": {"S": "deathmatch"}} .

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Values for use in  Player attribute  key-value  pairs.
                        This  object lets you specify an attribute value using
                        any of the valid data types:  string,  number,  string
                        array, or data map. Each AttributeValue object can use
                        only one of the available properties.

                        S -> (string)
                            For single string values. Maximum string length is
                            100 characters.

                            For number values, expressed as double.

                        SL -> (list)
                            For  a  list  of up to 100 strings. Maximum length
                            for each string is 100 characters. Duplicate  val-
                            ues are not recognized; all occurrences of the re-
                            peated value after the first of a  repeated  value
                            are ignored.

                            (string)

                        SDM -> (map)
                            For a map of up to 10 data type:value pairs. Maxi-
                            mum length for each string value  is  100  charac-
                            ters.

                            key -> (string)

                            value -> (double)

                 Team -> (string)
                     Name  of  the  team  that  the player is assigned to in a
                     match. Team names are defined in a matchmaking rule set.

                 LatencyInMs -> (map)
                     A set of values, expressed in  milliseconds,  that  indi-
                     cates  the  amount  of  latency that a player experiences
                     when connected to @aws;  Regions.  If  this  property  is
                     present,  FlexMatch  considers  placing the match only in
                     Regions for which latency is reported.

                     If a matchmaker has a rule that evaluates player latency,
                     players must report latency in order to be matched. If no
                     latency is reported in this scenario,  FlexMatch  assumes
                     that  no  Regions  are  available  to  the player and the
                     ticket is not matchable.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (integer)

          GameSessionConnectionInfo -> (structure)
              Identifier and connection information of the game  session  cre-
              ated for the match. This information is added to the ticket only
              after the matchmaking request has been  successfully  completed.
              This  parameter  is not set when FlexMatch is being used without
              GameLift hosting.

              GameSessionArn -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the game session. Use the  game  ses-
                 sion ID.

              IpAddress -> (string)
                 The  IP address of the game session. To connect to a GameLift
                 game server, an app needs both the IP address and  port  num-
                 ber.

              DnsName -> (string)
                 The  DNS  identifier assigned to the instance that is running
                 the game session. Values have the following format:

                 o TLS-enabled  fleets:  <unique  identifier>.<region  identi-
                   fier>.amazongamelift.com .

                 o Non-TLS-enabled    fleets:   ec2-<unique   identifier>.com-
                   pute.amazonaws.com . (See Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing
                   .)

                 When  connecting  to  a  game  session  that  is running on a
                 TLS-enabled fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the IP  ad-
                 dress.

              Port -> (integer)
                 The  port  number  for  the  game  session.  To  connect to a
                 GameLift game server, an app needs both the  IP  address  and
