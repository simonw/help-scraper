DESCRIBE-FLEET-ATTRIBUTES()                        DESCRIBE-FLEET-ATTRIBUTES()



NAME
       describe-fleet-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  core fleet-wide properties, including the computing hardware
       and deployment configuration for all instances in the fleet.

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To get attributes for one or more specific fleets, provide a list  of
         fleet IDs or fleet ARNs.

       o To get attributes for all fleets, do not provide a fleet identifier.

       When  requesting attributes for multiple fleets, use the pagination pa-
       rameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.

       If successful, a FleetAttributes object is returned for each fleet  re-
       quested, unless the fleet identifier is not found.

       NOTE:
              Some  API  operations limit the number of fleet IDs that allowed
              in one request. If a request exceeds  this  limit,  the  request
              fails and the error message contains the maximum allowed number.

       describe-fleet-attributes  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: FleetAttributes

SYNOPSIS
            describe-fleet-attributes
          [--fleet-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-ids (list)
          A list of unique fleet identifiers to retrieve attributes  for.  You
          can use either the fleet ID or ARN value. To retrieve attributes for
          all current fleets, do not include this parameter.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example1: To view attributes for a list of fleets

       The following describe-fleet-attributes  example  retrieves  fleet  at-
       tributes  for  two specified fleets. As shown, the requested fleets are
       deployed with the same build, one for On-Demand instances and  one  for
       Spot instances, with some minor configuration differences.

       Example2: To request attributes for all fleets

       The  following  describe-fleet-attributes  returns fleet attributes for
       all fleets with any status. This example illustrates the use of pagina-
       tion parameters to return one fleet at a time.

          aws gamelift describe-fleet-attributes \
              --limit 1

       Output:

          {
              "FleetAttributes": [
                  {
                      "FleetId": "fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",

          }

       The  output  includes  a NextToken value that you can use when you call
       the command a second time. Pass the value to the --next-token parameter
       to  specify  where to pick up the output. The following command returns
       the second result in the output.

          aws gamelift describe-fleet-attributes \
              --limit 1 \
              --next-token eyJhd3NBY2NvdW50SWQiOnsicyI6IjMwMjc3NjAxNjM5OCJ9LCJidWlsZElkIjp7InMiOiJidWlsZC01NWYxZTZmMS1jY2FlLTQ3YTctOWI5ZS1iYjFkYTQwMjEXAMPLE1

       Repeat until the response doesn't include a NextToken value.

                 This parameter is no longer used.  Server  launch  parameters
                 are  now  defined using the fleet's  RuntimeConfiguration pa-
                 rameter. Requests that use this parameter instead continue to
                 be valid.

              LogPaths -> (list)
                     This  parameter is no longer used. Game session log paths
                     are now defined using the GameLift  server  API  Process-
                     Ready()   logParameters  .  See  more  information in the
                     Server API Reference .

                 (string)

              NewGameSessionProtectionPolicy -> (string)
                 The type of game session protection to set  on  all  new  in-
                 stances that are started in the fleet.

                 o NoProtection -- The game session can be terminated during a
                   scale-down event.

                 o FullProtection -- If the game session is in an ACTIVE  sta-
                   tus, it cannot be terminated during a scale-down event.

              OperatingSystem -> (string)
                 The  operating  system  of the fleet's computing resources. A
                 fleet's operating system is determined by the OS of the build
                 or script that is deployed on this fleet.

              ResourceCreationLimitPolicy -> (structure)
                 The  fleet  policy that limits the number of game sessions an
                 individual player can create over a span of time.

                 NewGameSessionsPerCreator -> (integer)
                     The maximum number of game sessions  that  an  individual
                     can create during the policy period.

                 PolicyPeriodInMinutes -> (integer)
                     The  time  span  used in evaluating the resource creation

              InstanceRoleArn -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for an AWS IAM role that  manages  access
                 to  your AWS services. With an instance role ARN set, any ap-
                 plication that runs on an instance in this fleet  can  assume
                 the  role,  including  install scripts, server processes, and
                 daemons (background processes). Create a role or  look  up  a
                 role's  ARN  by using the IAM dashboard in the AWS Management
                 Console. Learn more about using on-box credentials  for  your

                       cate for this fleet.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates where to resume  retrieving  results  on  the
