OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A unique identifier for the matchmaking configuration to update. You
          can use either the configuration name or ARN value.

       --description (string)
          A  descriptive  label that is associated with matchmaking configura-
          tion.

       --game-session-queue-arns (list)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a GameLift  game
          session  queue  resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique
          across all Regions.  Format  is  arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gameses-
          sionqueue/<queue name> . Queues can be located in any Region. Queues
          are used to start new GameLift-hosted game sessions for matches that
          are created with this matchmaking configuration. If FlexMatchMode is
          set to STANDALONE , do not set this parameter.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --request-timeout-seconds (integer)
          The maximum duration, in seconds, that a matchmaking ticket can  re-
          main  in process before timing out. Requests that fail due to timing
          out can be resubmitted as needed.

       --acceptance-timeout-seconds (integer)
          The length of time (in seconds) to wait for players to accept a pro-
          posed match, if acceptance is required.

       --acceptance-required | --no-acceptance-required (boolean)
          A  flag  that  indicates  whether a match that was created with this
          configuration must be accepted by the matched  players.  To  require
          acceptance, set to TRUE. With this option enabled, matchmaking tick-
          ets use the status REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE to indicate when a  completed
          potential match is waiting for player acceptance.

       --rule-set-name (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for the matchmaking rule set to use with this
          configuration. You can use either the rule set name or ARN value.  A
          matchmaking configuration can only use rule sets that are defined in
          the same Region.

       --notification-target (string)
          An SNS topic ARN that is set up  to  receive  matchmaking  notifica-
          tions.  See Setting up notifications for matchmaking for more infor-
          mation.

       --additional-player-count (integer)
          The number of player slots in a match to keep open for future  play-
          ers.  For example, if the configuration's rule set specifies a match
          for a single 12-person team, and the additional player count is  set
          to  2, only 10 players are selected for the match. This parameter is
          not used if FlexMatchMode is set to STANDALONE .

       --custom-event-data (string)
          Information to add to all events related to the matchmaking configu-
          ration.

       --game-properties (list)
          A  set  of  custom  properties  for  a  game  session,  formatted as
          key:value pairs. These  properties  are  passed  to  a  game  server
          process  in  the   GameSession  object with a request to start a new
          game session (see Start a Game Session ). This information is  added
          to  the  new   GameSession  object  that is created for a successful
          match. This parameter is not used if FlexMatchMode is set to  STAND-
          ALONE .

          (structure)
              Set  of  key-value  pairs  that contain information about a game
              session. When included in a game session request, these  proper-
              ties communicate details to be used when setting up the new game
              session. For example, a game property might specify a game mode,
              level,  or  map.  Game  properties are passed to the game server
              process when initiating a new game session.  For  more  informa-
              tion, see the GameLift Developer Guide .

              Key -> (string)
                 The game property identifier.

              Value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --game-session-data (string)
          A  set  of  custom  game  session  properties, formatted as a single
          string value. This data is passed to a game server  process  in  the
          GameSession  object  with a request to start a new game session (see
          Start a Game Session ). This information is added to the new   Game-
          Session  object that is created for a successful match. This parame-
          ter is not used if FlexMatchMode is set to STANDALONE .

       --backfill-mode (string)
          The method that is used to backfill game sessions created with  this
          matchmaking  configuration.  Specify  MANUAL  when your game manages
          backfill requests manually or does not use the match  backfill  fea-
          ture.  Specify  AUTOMATIC to have GameLift create a  StartMatchBack-
          fill request whenever a game session has one  or  more  open  slots.
          Learn  more about manual and automatic backfill in Backfill Existing
          Games with FlexMatch . Automatic  backfill  is  not  available  when
          FlexMatchMode is set to STANDALONE .

          Possible values:

          o AUTOMATIC

          o MANUAL

       --flex-match-mode (string)
          Indicates  whether this matchmaking configuration is being used with
          GameLift hosting or as a standalone matchmaking solution.

          o STANDALONE - FlexMatch forms matches and  returns  match  informa-
            tion,    including    players   and   team   assignments,   in   a
            MatchmakingSucceeded event.

          o WITH_QUEUE -  FlexMatch  forms  matches  and  uses  the  specified
            GameLift queue to start a game session for the match.

          Possible values:

          o STANDALONE

          o WITH_QUEUE

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              ceptance.

          RuleSetName -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the matchmaking rule  set  to  use  with
              this  configuration.  A  matchmaking  configuration can only use
              rule sets that are defined in the same Region.

          RuleSetArn -> (string)

              sion  (see  Start a Game Session ). This information is added to
              the new  GameSession object that is  created  for  a  successful
              match.  This  parameter is not used when FlexMatchMode is set to
