NAME
       describe-game-session-details -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  additional  game session properties, including the game ses-
       sion protection policy in force, a set of one or more game sessions  in
       a  specific  fleet  location.  You can optionally filter the results by
       current game session status. Alternatively, use  SearchGameSessions  to
       request a set of active game sessions that are filtered by certain cri-
       teria. To retrieve all game session properties,  use   DescribeGameSes-
       sions .

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To  retrieve details for all game sessions that are currently running
         on all locations in a fleet, provide a fleet or alias ID, with an op-
         tional  status filter. This approach returns details from the fleet's
         home Region and all remote locations.

       o To retrieve details for all game sessions that are currently  running
         on a specific fleet location, provide a fleet or alias ID and a loca-
         tion name, with optional status  filter.  The  location  can  be  the
         fleet's home Region or any remote location.

       o To  retrieve  details  for  a specific game session, provide the game
         session ID. This approach looks for the game session ID in all fleets
         that reside in the Amazon Web Services Region defined in the request.

       Use  the  pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequen-
       tial pages.

       If successful, a GameSessionDetail object is  returned  for  each  game
       session that matches the request.

       describe-game-session-details  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: GameSessionDetails

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to retrieve all game sessions  ac-
          tive on the fleet. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --game-session-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the game session to retrieve.

       --alias-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the alias associated with the fleet to re-
          trieve all game sessions for. You can use either the alias ID or ARN
          value.

       --location (string)
          A fleet location to get game sessions for. You can specify a fleet's
          home Region or a remote location. Use the Amazon Web Services Region
          code format, such as us-west-2 .

       --status-filter (string)
          Game session status to filter results on. Possible game session sta-
          tuses include ACTIVE , TERMINATED , ACTIVATING and TERMINATING  (the
          last two are transitory).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,

                     A  unique identifier for the game session. A game session
                     ARN  has  the  following  format:   arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
                     gion>::gamesession/<fleet  ID>/<custom ID string or idem-
                     potency token> .

                 Name -> (string)
                     A descriptive label that is associated with a  game  ses-
                     sion. Session names do not need to be unique.

                 FleetId -> (string)
                     A  unique  identifier for the fleet that the game session
                     is running on.

                 FleetArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN  )  associated  with  the
                     GameLift fleet that this game session is running on.

                 CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                     A  time  stamp  indicating when this data object was cre-
                     ated. Format is a number expressed in Unix time  as  mil-
                     liseconds (for example "1469498468.057" ).

                 TerminationTime -> (timestamp)
                     A  time stamp indicating when this data object was termi-
                     nated. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as  mil-
                     liseconds (for example "1469498468.057" ).

                 CurrentPlayerSessionCount -> (integer)
                     Number of players currently in the game session.

                 MaximumPlayerSessionCount -> (integer)
                     The  maximum  number of players that can be connected si-
                     multaneously to the game session.

                 Status -> (string)
                     Current status of the game session. A game  session  must
                     have an ACTIVE status to have player sessions.

                 StatusReason -> (string)
                     Provides  additional  information about game session sta-
                     tus. INTERRUPTED indicates  that  the  game  session  was
                     hosted on a spot instance that was reclaimed, causing the
                     active game session to be terminated.

                 GameProperties -> (list)
                     A set of custom properties for a game session,  formatted
                     as key:value pairs. These properties are passed to a game
                     server process in the  GameSession object with a  request
                     to  start a new game session (see Start a Game Session ).
                     You can search for active game  sessions  based  on  this
                     custom data with  SearchGameSessions .

                     (structure)
                        Set  of key-value pairs that contain information about
                        a game session. When included in a  game  session  re-
                        quest, these properties communicate details to be used
                        when setting up the new game session. For  example,  a
                        game  property  might  specify  a game mode, level, or
                        map. Game properties are passed  to  the  game  server
                        process  when  initiating a new game session. For more
                        information, see the GameLift Developer Guide .

                        Key -> (string)
                            The game property identifier.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The game property value.

                 IpAddress -> (string)
                     The IP address of the  game  session.  To  connect  to  a
                     GameLift  game  server,  an app needs both the IP address
                     and port number.

                 DnsName -> (string)
                     The DNS identifier assigned to the instance that is  run-
                     ning the game session. Values have the following format:

                     o TLS-enabled fleets: <unique identifier>.<region identi-
                       fier>.amazongamelift.com .

                     o Non-TLS-enabled  fleets:  ec2-<unique  identifier>.com-
                       pute.amazonaws.com  .  (See  Amazon EC2 Instance IP Ad-
                       dressing .)

                     When connecting to a game session that is  running  on  a
                     TLS-enabled  fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the IP
                     address.

                 Port -> (integer)
                     The port number for the game session.  To  connect  to  a
                     GameLift  game  server,  an app needs both the IP address
                     and port number.

                 PlayerSessionCreationPolicy -> (string)
                     Indicates whether or not the game  session  is  accepting
                     new players.

                 CreatorId -> (string)
                     A  unique identifier for a player. This ID is used to en-
                     force a resource protection policy (if one exists),  that
                     limits the number of game sessions a player can create.

                 GameSessionData -> (string)
                     A  set  of custom game session properties, formatted as a
                     single string value. This data is passed to a game server
                     process  in  the   GameSession  object  with a request to
                     start a new game session (see Start a Game Session ).

                 MatchmakerData -> (string)
                     Information about the matchmaking process that  was  used
                     to create the game session. It is in JSON syntax, format-
                     ted as a string. In addition the  matchmaking  configura-
                     tion  used,  it  contains data on all players assigned to
                     the match, including player attributes and  team  assign-
                     ments.  For  more  details  on matchmaker data, see Match
                     Data . Matchmaker data is useful  when  requesting  match
                     backfills,  and is updated whenever new players are added
                     during a successful backfill (see StartMatchBackfill ).

                 Location -> (string)
                     The fleet location where the  game  session  is  running.
                     This value might specify the fleet's home Region or a re-
                     mote location. Location is expressed  as  an  Amazon  Web
                     Services Region code such as us-west-2 .

              ProtectionPolicy -> (string)
                 Current status of protection for the game session.

                 o NoProtection -- The game session can be terminated during a
                   scale-down event.

                 o FullProtection -- If the game session is in an ACTIVE  sta-
                   tus, it cannot be terminated during a scale-down event.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates  where to resume retrieving results on the
          next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these  results
          represent the end of the list.
