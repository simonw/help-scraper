DESCRIBE-FLEET-UTILIZATION()                      DESCRIBE-FLEET-UTILIZATION()



NAME
       describe-fleet-utilization -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  utilization  statistics  for one or more fleets. Utilization
       data provides a snapshot of how the fleet's hosting resources are  cur-
       rently being used. For fleets with remote locations, this operation re-
       trieves data for the fleet's home Region only. See   DescribeFleetLoca-
       tionUtilization  to get utilization statistics for a fleet's remote lo-
       cations.

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To get utilization data for one or more specific  fleets,  provide  a
         list of fleet IDs or fleet ARNs.

       o To  get utilization data for all fleets, do not provide a fleet iden-
         tifier.

       When requesting multiple fleets, use the pagination parameters  to  re-
       trieve results as a set of sequential pages.

       If  successful,  a   FleetUtilization  object  is returned for each re-
       quested fleet ID, unless the fleet identifier is not found. Each  fleet
       utilization  object  includes  a Location property, which is set to the
       fleet's home Region.

       NOTE:
              Some API operations may limit the number of fleet IDs allowed in
              one  request. If a request exceeds this limit, the request fails
              and the error message includes the maximum allowed.

       describe-fleet-utilization is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: FleetUtilization

SYNOPSIS
            describe-fleet-utilization
          [--fleet-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-ids (list)
          A  unique  identifier  for the fleet(s) to retrieve utilization data
          for. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value. To  retrieve  at-
          tributes for all current fleets, do not include this parameter.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example1: To view usage data for a list of fleets

       The  following describe-fleet-utilization example retrieves current us-
       age information for one specified fleet.

          aws gamelift describe-fleet-utilization \
              --fleet-ids arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-2::fleet/fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

       Output:

          {
              "FleetUtilization": [
                  {
                  "FleetId": "fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "ActiveServerProcessCount": 100,
                  "ActiveGameSessionCount": 62,
                  "CurrentPlayerSessionCount": 329,
                  "MaximumPlayerSessionCount": 1000
                  }
              ]
          }

       Example2: To request usage data for all fleets

       The following describe-fleet-utilization returns fleet usage  data  for
       all  fleets with any status. This example uses pagination parameters to
       return data for two fleets at a time.

          aws gamelift describe-fleet-utilization \
              --limit 2

       Output:

          {
              "FleetUtilization": [
                  {
                      "FleetId": "fleet-1111aaaa-22bb-33cc-44dd-5555eeee66ff",
                      "ActiveServerProcessCount": 100,
                      "ActiveGameSessionCount": 13,
                      "CurrentPlayerSessionCount": 98,
                      "MaximumPlayerSessionCount": 1000
                  },
                  {
                      "FleetId": "fleet-2222bbbb-33cc-44dd-55ee-6666ffff77aa",
                      "ActiveServerProcessCount": 100,
                      "ActiveGameSessionCount": 62,
                      "CurrentPlayerSessionCount": 329,
                      "MaximumPlayerSessionCount": 1000
                  }
              ],
              "NextToken": "eyJhd3NBY2NvdW50SWQiOnsicyI6IjMwMjc3NjAxNjM5OCJ9LCJidWlsZElkIjp7InMiOiJidWlsZC01NWYxZTZmMS1jY2FlLTQ3YTctOWI5ZS1iYjFkYTQwMjEXAMPLE2"
          }

       Call the command a second time, passing the NextToken value as the  ar-
       gument to the --next-token parameter to see the next two results.

          aws gamelift describe-fleet-utilization \
              --limit 2 \
              --next-token eyJhd3NBY2NvdW50SWQiOnsicyI6IjMwMjc3NjAxNjM5OCJ9LCJidWlsZElkIjp7InMiOiJidWlsZC01NWYxZTZmMS1jY2FlLTQ3YTctOWI5ZS1iYjFkYTQwMjEXAMPLE2

       Repeat  until  the response no longer includes a NextToken value in the
       output.

       GameLift Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       FleetUtilization -> (list)
          A  collection of objects containing utilization information for each
          requested fleet ID. Utilization objects are returned only for fleets
          that currently exist.

          (structure)
              Current  resource utilization statistics in a specified fleet or
              location. The location value might refer to a fleet's remote lo-
