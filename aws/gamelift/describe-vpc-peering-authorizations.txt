SYNOPSIS
            describe-vpc-peering-authorizations
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       VpcPeeringAuthorizations -> (list)
          A collection of objects that describe all valid VPC  peering  opera-
          tions for the current Amazon Web Services account.

          (structure)
              Represents an authorization for a VPC peering connection between
              the VPC for an Amazon GameLift fleet and another VPC on  an  ac-
              count  you  have access to. This authorization must exist and be
              valid for the peering connection to be  established.  Authoriza-
              tions are valid for 24 hours after they are issued.

              GameLiftAwsAccountId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the Amazon Web Services account  that
                 you  use to manage your GameLift fleet. You can find your Ac-
                 count ID in the Amazon Web Services Management Console  under
                 account settings.

              PeerVpcAwsAccountId -> (string)

              PeerVpcId -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier for a VPC with resources to be accessed
                 by your GameLift fleet. The VPC must be in the same Region as
                 your fleet. To look up a VPC ID, use the VPC Dashboard in the
                 Amazon Web Services Management Console. Learn more about  VPC
                 peering in VPC Peering with GameLift Fleets .

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 Time  stamp  indicating  when  this authorization was issued.
                 Format is a number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              ExpirationTime -> (timestamp)
                 Time  stamp  indicating  when  this authorization expires (24
                 hours after issuance). Format is a number expressed  in  Unix
                 time as milliseconds (for example "1469498468.057" ).
