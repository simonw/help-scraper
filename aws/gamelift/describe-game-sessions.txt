DESCRIBE-GAME-SESSIONS()                              DESCRIBE-GAME-SESSIONS()



NAME
       describe-game-sessions -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a set of one or more game sessions in a specific fleet loca-
       tion. You can optionally filter the results  by  current  game  session
       status.  Alternatively, use  SearchGameSessions to request a set of ac-
       tive game sessions that are filtered by certain criteria.  To  retrieve
       the  protection  policy  for game sessions, use  DescribeGameSessionDe-
       tails .

       This operation is not designed to be continually called to  track  game
       session  status.  This practice can cause you to exceed your API limit,
       which results in errors. Instead, you must configure configure an  Ama-
       zon  Simple  Notification  Service (SNS) topic to receive notifications
       from FlexMatch or queues. Continuously  polling  with  DescribeGameSes-
       sions  should  only be used for games in development with low game ses-
       sion usage.

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To retrieve all game sessions that are currently running on all loca-
         tions  in a fleet, provide a fleet or alias ID, with an optional sta-
         tus filter. This approach returns all game sessions  in  the  fleet's
         home Region and all remote locations.

       o To  retrieve  all  game sessions that are currently running on a spe-
         cific fleet location, provide a fleet or  alias  ID  and  a  location
         name,  with  optional  status filter. The location can be the fleet's
         home Region or any remote location.

       o To retrieve a specific game session, provide  the  game  session  ID.
         This approach looks for the game session ID in all fleets that reside
         in the Amazon Web Services Region defined in the request.

       Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set  of  sequen-
       tial pages.

       If  successful,  a GameSession object is returned for each game session
       that matches the request.

       This operation is not designed to be continually called to track match-
       making  ticket  status.  This practice can cause you to exceed your API
       limit, which results in errors. Instead, as a best practice, set up  an
       Amazon  Simple  Notification Service to receive notifications, and pro-
       vide the topic ARN in the matchmaking configuration. Continuously  pol-
       ing  ticket  status  with  DescribeGameSessions should only be used for
       games in development with low matchmaking usage.
          Available in Amazon GameLift Local.

       describe-game-sessions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: GameSessions

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to retrieve game sessions for. You
          can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --game-session-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the game session to retrieve.

       --alias-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the alias associated with the fleet  to  re-
          trieve  game  sessions  for.  You can use either the alias ID or ARN
          value.

       --location (string)
          A fleet location to get game session details for. You can specify  a
          fleet's  home  Region  or a remote location. Use the Amazon Web Ser-
          vices Region code format, such as us-west-2 .

       --status-filter (string)
          Game session status to filter results on. You can filter on the fol-
          lowing  states: ACTIVE , TERMINATED , ACTIVATING , and TERMINATING .
          The last two are transitory and used for only very brief periods  of
          time.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       GameSessions -> (list)
          A  collection  of  properties for each game session that matches the
          request.

          (structure)
              Properties describing a game session.

              A game session in ACTIVE status can host players.  When  a  game
              session ends, its status is set to TERMINATED .

              Once  the  session ends, the game session object is retained for
              30 days. This means you can reuse idempotency token values after
              this time. Game session logs are retained for 14 days.

              GameSessionId -> (string)
                 A  unique identifier for the game session. A game session ARN
                 has the following format: arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gameses-
                 sion/<fleet ID>/<custom ID string or idempotency token> .

              Name -> (string)
                 A  descriptive  label that is associated with a game session.
                 Session names do not need to be unique.

              FleetId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the fleet that the  game  session  is
                 running on.

              FleetArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) associated with the GameLift
                 fleet that this game session is running on.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A time stamp indicating when this data  object  was  created.
                 Format  is  a  number  expressed in Unix time as milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              TerminationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A time stamp indicating when this data object was terminated.
                 Format  is  a  number  expressed in Unix time as milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              CurrentPlayerSessionCount -> (integer)
                 Number of players currently in the game session.

              MaximumPlayerSessionCount -> (integer)
                 The maximum number of players that can be connected  simulta-
                 neously to the game session.

              Status -> (string)
                 Current  status of the game session. A game session must have
                 an ACTIVE status to have player sessions.

              StatusReason -> (string)
                 Provides additional information about  game  session  status.
                 INTERRUPTED  indicates  that the game session was hosted on a
                 spot instance that was reclaimed,  causing  the  active  game
                 session to be terminated.

              GameProperties -> (list)
                 A  set  of custom properties for a game session, formatted as
                 key:value pairs. These properties are passed to a game server
                 process  in the  GameSession object with a request to start a
                 new game session (see Start a Game Session ). You can  search
                 for  active  game  sessions  based  on  this custom data with
                 SearchGameSessions .

                 (structure)
                     Set of key-value pairs that contain information  about  a
                     game  session.  When  included in a game session request,
                     these properties communicate details to be used when set-
                     ting  up  the new game session. For example, a game prop-
                     erty might specify a game mode, level, or map. Game prop-
                     erties  are passed to the game server process when initi-
                     ating a new game session. For more information,  see  the
                     GameLift Developer Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The game property identifier.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The game property value.

              IpAddress -> (string)
                 The  IP address of the game session. To connect to a GameLift
                 game server, an app needs both the IP address and  port  num-
                 ber.

              DnsName -> (string)
                 The  DNS  identifier assigned to the instance that is running
                 the game session. Values have the following format:

                 o TLS-enabled  fleets:  <unique  identifier>.<region  identi-
                   fier>.amazongamelift.com .

                 o Non-TLS-enabled    fleets:   ec2-<unique   identifier>.com-
                   pute.amazonaws.com . (See Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing
                   .)

                 When  connecting  to  a  game  session  that  is running on a
                 TLS-enabled fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the IP  ad-
                 dress.

              Port -> (integer)
                 The  port  number  for  the  game  session.  To  connect to a
                 GameLift game server, an app needs both the  IP  address  and
                 port number.

              PlayerSessionCreationPolicy -> (string)
                 Indicates  whether  or  not the game session is accepting new
                 players.

              CreatorId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for a player. This ID is used to  enforce
                 a resource protection policy (if one exists), that limits the
                 number of game sessions a player can create.

              GameSessionData -> (string)
                 A set of custom game session properties, formatted as a  sin-
                 gle  string  value.  This  data  is  passed  to a game server
                 process in the  GameSession object with a request to start  a
                 new game session (see Start a Game Session ).

              MatchmakerData -> (string)
                 Information  about  the  matchmaking process that was used to
                 create the game session. It is in JSON syntax, formatted as a
                 string.  In  addition  the matchmaking configuration used, it
                 contains data on all players assigned to the match, including
                 player  attributes  and team assignments. For more details on
                 matchmaker data, see Match Data . Matchmaker data  is  useful
                 when  requesting match backfills, and is updated whenever new
                 players  are  added  during  a   successful   backfill   (see
                 StartMatchBackfill ).

              Location -> (string)
                 The  fleet  location  where the game session is running. This
                 value might specify the fleet's home Region or a remote loca-
                 tion.  Location is expressed as an Amazon Web Services Region
                 code such as us-west-2 .

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates where to resume  retrieving  results  on  the
          next  call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results
          represent the end of the list.
