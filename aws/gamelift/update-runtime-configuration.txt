UPDATE-RUNTIME-CONFIGURATION()                  UPDATE-RUNTIME-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       update-runtime-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  current  runtime  configuration  for the specified fleet,
       which tells Amazon GameLift how to launch server processes on  all  in-
       stances in the fleet. You can update a fleet's runtime configuration at
       any time after the fleet is created; it does not need to be  in  ACTIVE
       status.

       To  update  runtime  configuration,  specify the fleet ID and provide a
       RuntimeConfiguration with an updated set of server  process  configura-
       tions.

       If  successful, the fleet's runtime configuration settings are updated.
       Each instance in the fleet regularly checks for and  retrieves  updated
       runtime  configurations. Instances immediately begin complying with the
       new configuration by launching new server processes  or  not  replacing
       existing processes when they shut down. Updating a fleet's runtime con-
       figuration never affects existing server processes.

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to  update  runtime  configuration
          for. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --runtime-configuration (structure)
          Instructions  for launching server processes on each instance in the
          fleet. Server processes run either a custom game build executable or
          a Realtime Servers script. The runtime configuration lists the types
          of server processes to run on an instance, how to launch  them,  and
          the number of processes to run concurrently.

          ServerProcesses -> (list)
              A collection of server process configurations that identify what
              server processes to run on each instance in a fleet.

              (structure)
                 A set of instructions for launching server processes on  each
                 instance  in  a  fleet.  Server  processes run either an exe-
                 cutable in a custom game build or a Realtime Servers  script.
                 Server  process  configurations are part of a fleet's runtime
                 configuration.

                 LaunchPath -> (string)
                     The location of a game build executable or  the  Realtime
                     script  file  that  contains  the  Init()  function. Game
                     builds and Realtime scripts are installed on instances at
                     the root:

                     o Windows  (custom  game builds only): C:\game . Example:
                       "C:\game\MyGame\server.exe "

                     o Linux:     /local/game      .      Examples:      "/lo-
                       cal/game/MyGame/server.exe  "  or  "/local/game/MyReal-
                       timeScript.js "

                 Parameters -> (string)
                     An optional list of parameters to pass to the server exe-
                     cutable or Realtime script on launch.

                 ConcurrentExecutions -> (integer)
                     The  number  of server processes using this configuration
                     that run concurrently on each instance.

          MaxConcurrentGameSessionActivations -> (integer)
              The number of game sessions in status ACTIVATING to allow on  an
              instance. This setting limits the instance resources that can be
              used for new game activations at any one time.

          GameSessionActivationTimeoutSeconds -> (integer)
              The maximum amount of time (in seconds) allowed to launch a  new
              game  session  and  have it report ready to host players. During
              this time, the game session is in status  ACTIVATING  .  If  the
              game  session  does  not become active before the timeout, it is
              ended and the game session status is changed to TERMINATED .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ServerProcesses=[{LaunchPath=string,Parameters=string,ConcurrentExecutions=integer},{LaunchPath=string,Parameters=string,ConcurrentExecutions=integer}],MaxConcurrentGameSessionActivations=integer,GameSessionActivationTimeoutSeconds=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ServerProcesses": [
              {
                "LaunchPath": "string",
                "Parameters": "string",
                "ConcurrentExecutions": integer
              }
              ...
            ],
            "MaxConcurrentGameSessionActivations": integer,
            "GameSessionActivationTimeoutSeconds": integer
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       RuntimeConfiguration -> (structure)
          The  runtime  configuration currently in use by all instances in the
          fleet. If the update was successful, all property changes are shown.

                     builds and Realtime scripts are installed on instances at
                     the root:

                     o Windows (custom game builds only): C:\game  .  Example:

                     cutable or Realtime script on launch.

                 ConcurrentExecutions -> (integer)
                     The number of server processes using  this  configuration
                     that run concurrently on each instance.

          MaxConcurrentGameSessionActivations -> (integer)

          GameSessionActivationTimeoutSeconds -> (integer)
              The  maximum amount of time (in seconds) allowed to launch a new
