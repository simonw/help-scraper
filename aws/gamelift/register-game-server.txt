REGISTER-GAME-SERVER()                                  REGISTER-GAME-SERVER()



NAME
       register-game-server -

DESCRIPTION
          This  operation  is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game
          server groups.

       Creates a new game server resource and notifies GameLift  FleetIQ  that
       the  game  server is ready to host gameplay and players. This operation
       is called by a game server process that is running on an instance in  a
       game server group. Registering game servers enables GameLift FleetIQ to
       track available game servers and enables game clients and  services  to
       claim a game server for a new game session.

       To  register a game server, identify the game server group and instance
       where the game server is running, and provide a unique  identifier  for
       the  game server. You can also include connection and game server data.
       When a game client  or  service  requests  a  game  server  by  calling
       ClaimGameServer , this information is returned in the response.

       Once  a  game  server  is  successfully registered, it is put in status
       AVAILABLE . A request to register a game server may  fail  if  the  in-
       stance  it  is running on is in the process of shutting down as part of
       instance balancing or scale-down activity.

SYNOPSIS
            register-game-server
          --game-server-group-name <value>
          --game-server-id <value>
          --instance-id <value>
          [--connection-info <value>]
          [--game-server-data <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --game-server-group-name (string)
          A unique identifier for the game server group where the game  server
          is running. Use either the  GameServerGroup name or ARN value.

       --game-server-id (string)
          A  custom  string that uniquely identifies the game server to regis-
          ter. Game server IDs are developer-defined and must be unique across
          all game server groups in your Amazon Web Services account.

       --instance-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the instance where the game server is run-
          ning. This ID is available in the instance  metadata.  EC2  instance
          IDs use a 17-character format, for example: i-1234567890abcdef0 .

       --connection-info (string)
          Information that is needed to make inbound client connections to the
          game server. This might include the IP address and port,  DNS  name,
          and other information.

       --game-server-data (string)
          A set of custom game server properties, formatted as a single string
          value. This data is passed to a game client or service when  it  re-
          quests   information  on  game  servers  using   ListGameServers  or
          ClaimGameServer .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GameServer -> (structure)
          Object that describes the newly registered game server.

          GameServerGroupName -> (string)
              A  unique  identifier  for  the game server group where the game
              server is running. Use either the  GameServerGroup name  or  ARN
              value.

          GameServerGroupArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  identifier  for  the  game server group where the game
              server is located.

          GameServerId -> (string)
              A custom string that uniquely identifies the game  server.  Game
              server  IDs are developer-defined and are unique across all game
              server groups in an Amazon Web Services account.

          InstanceId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the instance where the game server  is
              running.  This ID is available in the instance metadata. EC2 in-
              stance   IDs   use   a   17-character   format,   for   example:
              i-1234567890abcdef0 .

          ConnectionInfo -> (string)
              The  port and IP address that must be used to establish a client
              connection to the game server.

          GameServerData -> (string)
              A set of custom game server properties, formatted  as  a  single
              string  value.  This  data is passed to a game client or service
              when it requests information on game  servers  using   ListGame-
              Servers or  ClaimGameServer .

          ClaimStatus -> (string)
              Indicates  when  an  available game server has been reserved for
              gameplay but has not yet started hosting  a  game.  Once  it  is
              claimed, the game server remains in CLAIMED status for a maximum
              of one minute. During this time, game  clients  connect  to  the
              game server to start the game and trigger the game server to up-
              date its utilization status. After one minute, the  game  server
              claim status reverts to null.

          UtilizationStatus -> (string)
              Indicates whether the game server is currently available for new
              games or is busy. Possible statuses include:

              o AVAILABLE - The game server is available to be claimed. A game
                server  that  has been claimed remains in this status until it
                reports game hosting activity.

              o UTILIZED - The game server is currently hosting a game session
                with players.

          RegistrationTime -> (timestamp)
              Timestamp that indicates when the game server was created with a
              RegisterGameServer request. The format is a number expressed  in
              Unix time as milliseconds (for example "1469498468.057" ).

          LastClaimTime -> (timestamp)
              Timestamp  that  indicates  the  last  time  the game server was
              claimed with a  ClaimGameServer request. The format is a  number
              expressed   in   Unix   time   as   milliseconds   (for  example
              "1469498468.057" ). This value  is  used  to  calculate  when  a
              claimed game server's status should revert to null.

          LastHealthCheckTime -> (timestamp)
              Timestamp  that  indicates the last time the game server was up-
              dated with health status using an  UpdateGameServer request. The
              format  is  a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for
              example "1469498468.057" ). After game server registration, this
              property  is  only changed when a game server update specifies a
              health check value.
