NAME
       describe-matchmaking-rule-sets -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the details for FlexMatch matchmaking rule sets. You can re-
       quest all existing rule sets for the Region, or provide a list  of  one
       or more rule set names. When requesting multiple items, use the pagina-
       tion parameters to retrieve results as a set of  sequential  pages.  If
       successful, a rule set is returned for each requested name.

       describe-matchmaking-rule-sets  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: RuleSets

SYNOPSIS
            describe-matchmaking-rule-sets
          [--names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --names (list)
          A list of one or more matchmaking rule set names to retrieve details
          for.  (Note: The rule set name is different from the optional "name"
          field in the rule set body.) You can use either the rule set name or
          ARN value.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RuleSets -> (list)
          A collection of requested matchmaking rule set objects.

          (structure)
              Set of rule statements, used with FlexMatch, that determine  how
              to  build your player matches. Each rule set describes a type of
              group to be created and defines the  parameters  for  acceptable
              player  matches. Rule sets are used in  MatchmakingConfiguration
              objects.

              A rule set may define the following elements for  a  match.  For
              detailed  information  and  examples  showing how to construct a
              rule set, see Build a FlexMatch rule set .

              o Teams -- Required. A rule set  must  define  one  or  multiple
                teams  for  the  match and set minimum and maximum team sizes.
                For example, a rule set might describe a 4x4  match  that  re-
                quires all eight slots to be filled.

              o Player  attributes -- Optional. These attributes specify a set
                of player characteristics  to  evaluate  when  looking  for  a
                match.  Matchmaking  requests  that use a rule set with player
                attributes must provide the  corresponding  attribute  values.
                For  example,  an  attribute might specify a player's skill or
                level.

              o Rules -- Optional. Rules  define  how  to  evaluate  potential
                players  for  a match based on player attributes. A rule might
                specify minimum requirements for individual players, teams, or
                entire  matches. For example, a rule might require each player
                to meet a certain skill level, each team to have at least  one
                player in a certain role, or the match to have a minimum aver-
                age skill level. or may describe an entire group--such as  all
                teams  must be evenly matched or have at least one player in a
                certain role.

              o Expansions -- Optional. Expansions  allow  you  to  relax  the
                rules  after  a  period of time when no acceptable matches are
                found. This feature lets  you  balance  getting  players  into
                games  in  a  reasonable amount of time instead of making them
                wait indefinitely for the best possible  match.  For  example,
                you might use an expansion to increase the maximum skill vari-
                ance between players after 30 seconds.

              RuleSetName -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the matchmaking rule set

              RuleSetArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN  )  that  is  assigned  to  a
                 GameLift  matchmaking  rule set resource and uniquely identi-
                 fies it. ARNs  are  unique  across  all  Regions.  Format  is
                 arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::matchmakingruleset/<ruleset  name>
                 . In a GameLift rule set ARN, the  resource  ID  matches  the
                 RuleSetName value.

              RuleSetBody -> (string)
                 A  collection  of  matchmaking  rules,  formatted  as  a JSON
                 string. Comments are not allowed in JSON, but  most  elements
                 support a description field.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  time  stamp  indicating when this data object was created.
                 Format is a number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates  where to resume retrieving results on the
          next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these  results
          represent the end of the list.
