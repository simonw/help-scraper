NAME
       describe-fleet-location-utilization -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  current  usage  data  for a fleet location. Utilization data
       provides a snapshot of current game hosting activity at  the  requested
       location.  Use this operation to retrieve utilization information for a
       fleet's remote location or home Region (you can also retrieve home  Re-
       gion utilization by calling DescribeFleetUtilization ).

       To retrieve utilization data, identify a fleet and location.

       If  successful, a FleetUtilization object is returned for the requested
       fleet location.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-fleet-location-utilization
          --fleet-id <value>
          --location <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to  request  location  utilization
          for. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --location (string)
          The  fleet location to retrieve utilization information for. Specify
          a location in the form of an AWS Region code, such as us-west-2 .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FleetUtilization -> (structure)
          Utilization  information  for the requested fleet location. Utiliza-
          tion objects are returned only for fleets and  locations  that  cur-
          rently exist.

          FleetId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the fleet associated with the location.

          FleetArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a GameLift
              fleet resource and  uniquely  identifies  it.  ARNs  are  unique
              across    all    Regions.    Format   is   arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
              gion>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912 .

          ActiveServerProcessCount -> (integer)
              The number of server processes in ACTIVE status  that  are  cur-
              rently running across all instances in the fleet location.

          ActiveGameSessionCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of  active  game  sessions that are currently being
              hosted across all instances in the fleet location.

          CurrentPlayerSessionCount -> (integer)
              The number of active player sessions that  are  currently  being
              hosted across all instances in the fleet location.

          MaximumPlayerSessionCount -> (integer)
              The  maximum  number of players allowed across all game sessions
              that are currently being hosted  across  all  instances  in  the
              fleet location.

          Location -> (string)
              The  fleet  location  for the fleet utilization information, ex-
              pressed as an AWS Region code, such as us-west-2 .
