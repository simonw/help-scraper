NAME
       create-matchmaking-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Defines a new matchmaking configuration for use with FlexMatch. Whether
       your are using FlexMatch with  GameLift  hosting  or  as  a  standalone
       matchmaking  service,  the matchmaking configuration sets out rules for
       matching players and forming teams. If you're also using GameLift host-
       ing,  it defines how to start game sessions for each match. Your match-
       making system can use multiple configurations to handle different  game
       scenarios.  All matchmaking requests ( StartMatchmaking or  StartMatch-
       Backfill ) identify the matchmaking configuration to  use  and  provide
       player attributes consistent with that configuration.

       To  create a matchmaking configuration, you must provide the following:
       configuration name and FlexMatch mode (with or without  GameLift  host-
       ing);  a  rule  set that specifies how to evaluate players and find ac-
       ceptable matches; whether player acceptance is required; and the  maxi-
       mum  time  allowed for a matchmaking attempt. When using FlexMatch with
       GameLift hosting, you also need to identify the game session  queue  to
       use when starting a game session for the match.

       In  addition,  you  must  set  up an Amazon Simple Notification Service
       topic to receive matchmaking notifications. Provide the  topic  ARN  in
       the  matchmaking  configuration.  An  alternative  method, continuously
       polling ticket status with  DescribeMatchmaking , is only suitable  for
       games in development with low matchmaking usage.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A  unique identifier for the matchmaking configuration. This name is
          used to identify the configuration associated with a matchmaking re-
          quest or ticket.

       --description (string)
          A human-readable description of the matchmaking configuration.

       --game-session-queue-arns (list)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a GameLift game
          session queue resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs  are  unique
          across  all  Regions.  Format is arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gameses-
          sionqueue/<queue name> . Queues can be located in any Region. Queues
          are used to start new GameLift-hosted game sessions for matches that
          are created with this matchmaking configuration. If FlexMatchMode is
          set to STANDALONE , do not set this parameter.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --request-timeout-seconds (integer)
          The  maximum duration, in seconds, that a matchmaking ticket can re-
          main in process before timing out. Requests that fail due to  timing
          out can be resubmitted as needed.

       --acceptance-timeout-seconds (integer)
          The length of time (in seconds) to wait for players to accept a pro-
          posed match, if acceptance is required.

       --acceptance-required | --no-acceptance-required (boolean)
          A flag that determines whether a match that was  created  with  this
          configuration  must  be  accepted by the matched players. To require
          acceptance, set to TRUE .  With  this  option  enabled,  matchmaking
          tickets  use  the status REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE to indicate when a com-
          pleted potential match is waiting for player acceptance.

       --rule-set-name (string)
          A unique identifier for the matchmaking rule set to  use  with  this
          configuration.  You can use either the rule set name or ARN value. A
          matchmaking configuration can only use rule sets that are defined in
          the same Region.

       --notification-target (string)
          An  SNS  topic  ARN  that is set up to receive matchmaking notifica-
          tions. See Setting up notifications for matchmaking for more  infor-
          mation.

       --additional-player-count (integer)
          The  number of player slots in a match to keep open for future play-
          ers. For example, if the configuration's rule set specifies a  match
          for  a single 12-person team, and the additional player count is set
          to 2, only 10 players are selected for the match. This parameter  is
          not used if FlexMatchMode is set to STANDALONE .

       --custom-event-data (string)
          Information  to  be  added to all events related to this matchmaking
          configuration.

       --game-properties (list)
          A set  of  custom  properties  for  a  game  session,  formatted  as
          key:value  pairs.  These  properties  are  passed  to  a game server
          process in the  GameSession object with a request  to  start  a  new
          game  session (see Start a Game Session ). This information is added
          to the new  GameSession object that  is  created  for  a  successful
          match.  This parameter is not used if FlexMatchMode is set to STAND-
          ALONE .

          (structure)
              Set of key-value pairs that contain  information  about  a  game
              session.  When included in a game session request, these proper-
              ties communicate details to be used when setting up the new game
              session. For example, a game property might specify a game mode,
              level, or map. Game properties are passed  to  the  game  server
              process  when  initiating  a new game session. For more informa-
              tion, see the GameLift Developer Guide .

              Key -> (string)

              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --game-session-data (string)
          A set of custom game  session  properties,  formatted  as  a  single
          string  value.  This  data is passed to a game server process in the
          GameSession object with a request to start a new game  session  (see
          Start  a Game Session ). This information is added to the new  Game-
          Session object that is created for a successful match. This  parame-
          ter is not used if FlexMatchMode is set to STANDALONE .

       --backfill-mode (string)
          The method used to backfill game sessions that are created with this
          matchmaking configuration. Specify MANUAL  when  your  game  manages
          backfill  requests  manually or does not use the match backfill fea-
          ture. Specify AUTOMATIC to have GameLift create  a   StartMatchBack-
          fill  request  whenever  a  game session has one or more open slots.
          Learn more about manual and automatic backfill in Backfill  Existing
          Games  with  FlexMatch  .  Automatic  backfill is not available when

            tion,   including   players   and   team   assignments,    in    a
            MatchmakingSucceeded event.

          o WITH_QUEUE  -  FlexMatch  forms  matches  and  uses  the specified
            GameLift queue to start a game session for the match.

          Possible values:

          o STANDALONE

          o WITH_QUEUE

       --tags (list)
          A list of labels to assign to the new matchmaking configuration  re-
          source.  Tags  are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging Amazon
          Web Services resources are useful for  resource  management,  access
          management  and  cost  allocation. For more information, see Tagging
          Amazon Web Services Resources in the  Amazon  Web  Services  General
          Reference . Once the resource is created, you can use  TagResource ,
          UntagResource , and  ListTagsForResource to add,  remove,  and  view
          tags. The maximum tag limit may be lower than stated. See the Amazon
          Web Services General Reference for actual tagging limits.

          (structure)
              A label that can be assigned to a GameLift resource.

            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
