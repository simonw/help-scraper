CREATE-MATCHMAKING-RULE-SET()                    CREATE-MATCHMAKING-RULE-SET()



NAME
       create-matchmaking-rule-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new rule set for FlexMatch matchmaking. A rule set describes
       the type of match to create, such as the number and size of  teams.  It
       also sets the parameters for acceptable player matches, such as minimum
       skill level or character type. A rule set is used by a  MatchmakingCon-
       figuration .

       To  create a matchmaking rule set, provide unique rule set name and the
       rule set body in JSON format. Rule sets must be defined in the same Re-
       gion as the matchmaking configuration they are used with.

       Since  matchmaking  rule  sets  cannot  be edited, it is a good idea to
       check the rule set syntax using  ValidateMatchmakingRuleSet before cre-
       ating a new rule set.

SYNOPSIS
            create-matchmaking-rule-set
          --name <value>
          --rule-set-body <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A unique identifier for the matchmaking rule set. A matchmaking con-
          figuration identifies the rule set it uses by this name value.  Note
          that  the rule set name is different from the optional name field in
          the rule set body.

       --rule-set-body (string)
          A collection of matchmaking rules, formatted as a JSON string.  Com-
          ments  are not allowed in JSON, but most elements support a descrip-
          tion field.

       --tags (list)
          A list of labels to assign to the new matchmaking rule set resource.
          Tags  are  developer-defined  key-value pairs. Tagging AWS resources
          are useful for resource management, access management and cost allo-
          cation.  For  more information, see Tagging AWS Resources in the AWS
          General Reference . Once  the  resource  is  created,  you  can  use
          TagResource  ,  UntagResource , and  ListTagsForResource to add, re-
          move, and view tags. The maximum tag limit may be lower than stated.
          See the AWS General Reference for actual tagging limits.

          (structure)
              A label that can be assigned to a GameLift resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for a developer-defined key:value pair for tagging an
                 AWS resource.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value for a developer-defined key:value pair for tagging
                 an AWS resource.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RuleSet -> (structure)
          The newly created matchmaking rule set.

          RuleSetName -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the matchmaking rule set

          RuleSetArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a GameLift
              matchmaking rule set resource and uniquely identifies  it.  ARNs
              are  unique  across all Regions. Format is arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
              gion>::matchmakingruleset/<ruleset name> . In  a  GameLift  rule
              set ARN, the resource ID matches the RuleSetName value.

          RuleSetBody -> (string)
              A  collection  of matchmaking rules, formatted as a JSON string.
              Comments are not allowed in JSON, but most  elements  support  a
              description field.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A  time stamp indicating when this data object was created. For-
              mat is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for  ex-
              ample "1469498468.057" ).
