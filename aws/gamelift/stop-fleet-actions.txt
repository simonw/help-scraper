STOP-FLEET-ACTIONS()                                      STOP-FLEET-ACTIONS()



NAME
       stop-fleet-actions -

DESCRIPTION
       Suspends certain types of activity in a fleet location. Currently, this
       operation is used to stop  auto-scaling  activity.  For  multi-location
       fleets, fleet actions are managed separately for each location.

       Stopping fleet actions has several potential purposes. It allows you to
       temporarily stop auto-scaling activity but retain your scaling policies
       for  use  in  the  future.  For  multi-location  fleets, you can set up
       fleet-wide auto-scaling, and then opt out of it for certain locations.

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To stop actions on instances in the fleet's home  Region,  provide  a
         fleet ID and the type of actions to suspend.

       o To  stop actions on instances in one of the fleet's remote locations,
         provide a fleet ID, a location name, and the type of actions to  sus-
         pend.

       If  successful,  GameLift  no longer initiates scaling events except in
       response to manual changes using  UpdateFleetCapacity . You can view  a
       fleet's   stopped   actions   using   DescribeFleetAttributes  or   De-
       scribeFleetLocationAttributes . Suspended activity can be restarted us-
       ing  StartFleetActions .

SYNOPSIS
            stop-fleet-actions
          --fleet-id <value>
          --actions <value>
          [--location <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to stop actions on.  You  can  use
          either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --actions (list)
          List of actions to suspend on the fleet.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            AUTO_SCALING

       --location (string)
          The  fleet location to stop fleet actions for. Specify a location in
          the form of an AWS Region code, such as us-west-2 .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To stop a fleet's automatic scaling activity

       The following stop-fleet-actions example stops the use of  all  scaling
       policies  that  are defined for the specified fleet. After the policies
       are suspended, fleet capacity remains at the same active instance count
       unless you adjust it manually.

          aws gamelift start-fleet-actions \
              --fleet-id fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111 \
              --actions AUTO_SCALING

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       FleetId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to stop actions on.

       FleetArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a GameLift fleet
          resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all  Re-
          gions.           Format           is           arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
          gion>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912 .
