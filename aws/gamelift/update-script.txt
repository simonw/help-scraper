UPDATE-SCRIPT()                                                UPDATE-SCRIPT()



NAME
       update-script -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates Realtime script metadata and content.

       To  update  script  metadata, specify the script ID and provide updated
       name and/or version values.

       To update script content, provide an updated zip file  by  pointing  to
       either a local file or an Amazon S3 bucket location. You can use either
       method regardless of how the original script was uploaded. Use the Ver-
       sion parameter to track updates to the script.

       If the call is successful, the updated metadata is stored in the script
       record and a revised script is uploaded to the Amazon GameLift service.
       Once  the  script  is updated and acquired by a fleet instance, the new
       version is used for all new game sessions.

OPTIONS
       --script-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the Realtime script to update. You  can  use
          either the script ID or ARN value.

       --name (string)
          A  descriptive  label that is associated with a script. Script names
          don't need to be unique.

       --storage-location (structure)
          The location of the Amazon S3 bucket where a zipped file  containing
          your  Realtime  scripts is stored. The storage location must specify
          the Amazon S3 bucket name, the zip file name (the "key"), and a role
          ARN  that allows Amazon GameLift to access the Amazon S3 storage lo-
          cation. The S3 bucket must be in the same Region where you  want  to
          create  a new script. By default, Amazon GameLift uploads the latest
          version of the zip file; if you have S3 object versioning turned on,
          you  can  use the ObjectVersion parameter to specify an earlier ver-
          sion.

          Bucket -> (string)
              An Amazon S3 bucket identifier. Thename of the S3 bucket.

              NOTE:
                 Amazon GameLift doesn't  support  uploading  from  Amazon  S3
                 buckets with names that contain a dot (.).

          Key -> (string)
              The name of the zip file that contains the build files or script
              files.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) for an IAM role that allows Ama-
              zon GameLift to access the S3 bucket.

          ObjectVersion -> (string)
              The  version  of the file, if object versioning is turned on for
              the bucket. Amazon GameLift uses this information when  retriev-
              ing  files from an S3 bucket that you own. Use this parameter to
              specify a specific version of the file. If not set,  the  latest
              version of the file is retrieved.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Bucket=string,Key=string,RoleArn=string,ObjectVersion=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Bucket": "string",
            "Key": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string",
            "ObjectVersion": "string"
          }

       --zip-file (blob)
          A data object containing your Realtime scripts and dependencies as a
          zip file. The zip file can have one or multiple files. Maximum  size
          of a zip file is 5 MB.

          When using the Amazon Web Services CLI tool to create a script, this
          parameter is set to the zip file name. It must be prepended with the
          string "fileb://" to indicate that the file data is a binary object.
          For example: --zip-file fileb://myRealtimeScript.zip .

       --script-version (string)
          Version information associated  with  a  build  or  script.  Version
          strings don't need to be unique.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Script -> (structure)
          The newly created script record with a unique  script  ID.  The  new
          script's storage location reflects an Amazon S3 location: (1) If the
          script was uploaded from an S3 bucket under your account, the  stor-
          age  location reflects the information that was provided in the Cre-
          ateScript request; (2) If the script file was uploaded from a  local
          zip  file,  the storage location reflects an S3 location controls by
          the Amazon GameLift service.

          ScriptId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the Realtime script

          ScriptArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is  assigned  to  a  Amazon
              GameLift  script  resource  and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are
              unique across all Regions. In a GameLift  script  ARN,  the  re-
              source ID matches the ScriptId value.

          Name -> (string)
              A  descriptive  label  that  is associated with a script. Script
              names don't need to be unique.

          Version -> (string)
              Version information associated with a build or  script.  Version
              strings don't need to be unique.

          SizeOnDisk -> (long)
              The  file  size  of  the  uploaded Realtime script, expressed in
              bytes. When files are uploaded from an S3 location,  this  value
              remains at "0".

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A  time stamp indicating when this data object was created. For-
              mat is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for  ex-
              ample "1469498468.057" ).

          StorageLocation -> (structure)
              The  location  of  the Amazon S3 bucket where a zipped file con-
              taining your Realtime scripts is stored.  The  storage  location
              must  specify  the Amazon S3 bucket name, the zip file name (the
              "key"), and a role ARN that allows Amazon GameLift to access the
              Amazon  S3  storage  location. The S3 bucket must be in the same
              Region where you want to create a new script. By default, Amazon
              GameLift uploads the latest version of the zip file; if you have
              S3 object versioning turned on, you can  use  the  ObjectVersion
              parameter to specify an earlier version.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 An Amazon S3 bucket identifier. Thename of the S3 bucket.

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon  GameLift doesn't support uploading from Amazon S3
                     buckets with names that contain a dot (.).

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the zip file that contains  the  build  files  or
                 script files.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN ) for an IAM role that allows
                 Amazon GameLift to access the S3 bucket.

              ObjectVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the file, if object versioning  is  turned  on
                 for  the  bucket.  Amazon GameLift uses this information when
                 retrieving files from an S3 bucket that you own. Use this pa-
                 rameter  to  specify  a  specific version of the file. If not
                 set, the latest version of the file is retrieved.
