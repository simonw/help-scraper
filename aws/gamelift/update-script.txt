UPDATE-SCRIPT()                                                UPDATE-SCRIPT()



NAME
       update-script -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates Realtime script metadata and content.

       To  update  script  metadata, specify the script ID and provide updated
       name and/or version values.

       To update script content, provide an updated zip file  by  pointing  to
       either a local file or an Amazon S3 bucket location. You can use either
       method regardless of how the original script was uploaded. Use the Ver-
       sion parameter to track updates to the script.

       If the call is successful, the updated metadata is stored in the script
       record and a revised script is uploaded to the Amazon GameLift service.
       Once  the  script  is updated and acquired by a fleet instance, the new
       version is used for all new game sessions.

SYNOPSIS
            update-script
          --script-id <value>
          [--name <value>]
          [--storage-location <value>]
          [--zip-file <value>]
          [--script-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --script-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the Realtime script to update. You can use
          either the script ID or ARN value.

       --name (string)
          A descriptive label that is associated with a script.  Script  names
          do not need to be unique.

       --storage-location (structure)
          The  location of the Amazon S3 bucket where a zipped file containing
          your Realtime scripts is stored. The storage location  must  specify
          the Amazon S3 bucket name, the zip file name (the "key"), and a role
          ARN that allows Amazon GameLift to access the Amazon S3 storage  lo-
          cation.  The  S3 bucket must be in the same Region where you want to
          create a new script. By default, Amazon GameLift uploads the  latest
          version of the zip file; if you have S3 object versioning turned on,
          you can use the ObjectVersion parameter to specify an  earlier  ver-
          sion.

          Bucket -> (string)
              An  Amazon  S3  bucket  identifier.  This  is the name of the S3
              bucket.

              NOTE:
                 GameLift currently does not support uploading from Amazon  S3
                 buckets with names that contain a dot (.).

          Key -> (string)
              The name of the zip file that contains the build files or script
              files.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) for an IAM role that allows Ama-
              zon GameLift to access the S3 bucket.

          ObjectVersion -> (string)
              The  version  of the file, if object versioning is turned on for
              the bucket. Amazon GameLift uses this information when  retriev-
              ing  files from an S3 bucket that you own. Use this parameter to
              specify a specific version of the file. If not set,  the  latest
              version of the file is retrieved.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Bucket=string,Key=string,RoleArn=string,ObjectVersion=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Bucket": "string",
            "Key": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string",
            "ObjectVersion": "string"
          }

       --zip-file (blob)
          A data object containing your Realtime scripts and dependencies as a
          zip file. The zip file can have one or multiple files. Maximum  size
          of a zip file is 5 MB.

          When using the Amazon Web Services CLI tool to create a script, this
          parameter is set to the zip file name. It must be prepended with the
          string "fileb://" to indicate that the file data is a binary object.
          For example: --zip-file fileb://myRealtimeScript.zip .

       --script-version (string)
          Version information that is associated with a build or script.  Ver-
          sion strings do not need to be unique.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Script -> (structure)
          The newly created script record with a unique  script  ID.  The  new
          script's storage location reflects an Amazon S3 location: (1) If the
          script was uploaded from an S3 bucket under your account, the  stor-
          age  location reflects the information that was provided in the Cre-
          ateScript request; (2) If the script file was uploaded from a  local
          zip  file,  the storage location reflects an S3 location controls by
          the Amazon GameLift service.

          ScriptId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the Realtime script

          ScriptArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to  a  GameLift
              script  resource  and  uniquely  identifies  it. ARNs are unique
              across all Regions. In a GameLift script ARN,  the  resource  ID
              matches the ScriptId value.

          Name -> (string)
              A  descriptive  label  that  is associated with a script. Script
              names do not need to be unique.

          Version -> (string)
              Version information that is associated with a build  or  script.
              Version strings do not need to be unique.

          SizeOnDisk -> (long)
              The  file  size  of  the  uploaded Realtime script, expressed in
              bytes. When files are uploaded from an S3 location,  this  value
              remains at "0".

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A  time stamp indicating when this data object was created. For-
              mat is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for  ex-
              ample "1469498468.057" ).

          StorageLocation -> (structure)
              The location in Amazon S3 where build or script files are stored
              for access by Amazon GameLift. This  location  is  specified  in
              CreateBuild ,  CreateScript , and  UpdateScript requests.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 An  Amazon  S3  bucket identifier. This is the name of the S3
                 bucket.

                 NOTE:
                     GameLift currently does not support uploading from Amazon
                     S3 buckets with names that contain a dot (.).

              Key -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  zip file that contains the build files or
                 script files.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) for an IAM role  that  allows
                 Amazon GameLift to access the S3 bucket.

              ObjectVersion -> (string)
                 The  version  of  the file, if object versioning is turned on
                 for the bucket. Amazon GameLift uses  this  information  when
                 retrieving files from an S3 bucket that you own. Use this pa-
                 rameter to specify a specific version of  the  file.  If  not
                 set, the latest version of the file is retrieved.
