DESCRIBE-FLEET-PORT-SETTINGS()                  DESCRIBE-FLEET-PORT-SETTINGS()



NAME
       describe-fleet-port-settings -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a fleet's inbound connection permissions. Connection permis-
       sions specify the range of IP addresses and port settings that incoming
       traffic  can use to access server processes in the fleet. Game sessions
       that are running on instances in the fleet must  use  connections  that
       fall in this range.

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To  retrieve the inbound connection permissions for a fleet, identify
         the fleet's unique identifier.

       o To check the status of recent updates to  a  fleet  remote  location,
         specify  the  fleet  ID and a location. Port setting updates can take
         time to propagate across all locations.

       If successful, a set of  IpPermission objects is returned for  the  re-
       quested fleet ID. When a location is specified, a pending status is in-
       cluded. If the requested fleet has been  deleted,  the  result  set  is
       empty.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-fleet-port-settings
          --fleet-id <value>
          [--location <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to retrieve port settings for. You
          can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --location (string)
          A remote location to check for status of port setting  updates.  Use
          the Amazon Web Services Region code format, such as us-west-2 .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view inbound connection permissions for a fleet

       The following describe-fleet-port-settings example retrieves connection
       settings for a specified fleet.

          aws gamelift describe-fleet-port-settings \
              --fleet-id arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-2::fleet/fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

       Output:

          {
              "InboundPermissions": [
                  {
                      "FromPort": 33400,
                      "ToPort": 33500,
                      "IpRange": "0.0.0.0/0",
                      "Protocol": "UDP"
                  },
                  {
                      "FromPort": 1900,
                      "ToPort": 2000,
                      "IpRange": "0.0.0.0/0",
                      "Protocol": "TCP"
                  }
              ]
          }

       For  more  information,  see  Setting  Up GameLift Fleets in the Amazon
       GameLift Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       FleetId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet that was requested.

       FleetArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a GameLift fleet
          resource  and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Re-
          gions.           Format           is           arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
          gion>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912 .

       InboundPermissions -> (list)
          The port settings for the requested fleet ID.

          (structure)
              A  range  of  IP  addresses and port settings that allow inbound
              traffic to connect to server  processes  on  an  instance  in  a
              fleet.  New game sessions are assigned an IP address/port number
              combination, which must fall into the  fleet's  allowed  ranges.
              Fleets  with custom game builds must have permissions explicitly
              set. For Realtime Servers fleets, GameLift  automatically  opens
              two port ranges, one for TCP messaging and one for UDP.

                     DescribeFleetPortSettings

              FromPort -> (integer)
                 A starting value for a range of allowed port numbers.

                 For  fleets  using  Windows  and  Linux  builds,  only  ports
                 1026-60000 are valid.

              ToPort -> (integer)
                 An ending value for a range of  allowed  port  numbers.  Port
                 numbers  are  end-inclusive.  This  value must be higher than
                 FromPort .

                 For  fleets  using  Windows  and  Linux  builds,  only  ports
                 1026-60000 are valid.

              IpRange -> (string)
                 A range of allowed IP addresses. This value must be expressed
                 in CIDR notation. Example: "000.000.000.000/[subnet  mask]  "
                 or optionally the shortened version "0.0.0.0/[subnet mask] ".

              Protocol -> (string)
                 The network communication protocol used by the fleet.

       UpdateStatus -> (string)
          The  current  status  of updates to the fleet's port settings in the
          requested fleet location. A status of PENDING_UPDATE indicates  that
          an update was requested for the fleet but has not yet been completed
          for the location.

       Location -> (string)
          The requested fleet location, expressed as an  Amazon  Web  Services
          Region code, such as us-west-2 .
