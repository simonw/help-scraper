UPDATE-GAME-SERVER()                                      UPDATE-GAME-SERVER()



NAME
       update-game-server -

DESCRIPTION
          This  operation  is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game
          server groups.

       Updates information about a registered game  server  to  help  GameLift
       FleetIQ  to track game server availability. This operation is called by
       a game server process that is running on an instance in a  game  server
       group.

       Use  this operation to update the following types of game server infor-
       mation. You can make all three types of updates in the same request:

       o To update the game server's utilization  status,  identify  the  game
         server and game server group and specify the current utilization sta-
         tus. Use this status to identify  when  game  servers  are  currently
         hosting games and when they are available to be claimed.

       o To  report  health  status,  identify the game server and game server
         group and set health check to HEALTHY . If a game server does not re-
         port  health  status for a certain length of time, the game server is
         no longer considered healthy. As a  result,  it  will  be  eventually
         deregistered  from  the game server group to avoid affecting utiliza-
         tion metrics. The best practice is to report health every 60 seconds.

       o To change game server metadata, provide updated game server data.

       Once a game server is successfully updated, the relevant  statuses  and
       timestamps are updated.

SYNOPSIS
            update-game-server
          --game-server-group-name <value>
          --game-server-id <value>
          [--game-server-data <value>]
          [--utilization-status <value>]
          [--health-check <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --game-server-group-name (string)
          A  unique identifier for the game server group where the game server
          is running. Use either the  GameServerGroup name or ARN value.

       --game-server-id (string)
          A custom string that uniquely identifies the game server to update.

       --game-server-data (string)
          A set of custom game server properties, formatted as a single string
          value.  This  data is passed to a game client or service when it re-
          quests  information  on  game  servers  using   ListGameServers   or
          ClaimGameServer .

       --utilization-status (string)
          Indicates whether the game server is available or is currently host-
          ing gameplay.

          Possible values:

          o AVAILABLE

          o UTILIZED

       --health-check (string)
          Indicates health status of the game server. A request that  includes
          this  parameter  updates the game server's LastHealthCheckTime time-
          stamp.

          Possible values:

          o HEALTHY

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GameServer -> (structure)
          Object that describes the newly updated game server.

          GameServerGroupName -> (string)
              A  unique  identifier  for  the game server group where the game
              server is running. Use either the  GameServerGroup name  or  ARN
              value.

          GameServerGroupArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  identifier  for  the  game server group where the game
              server is located.

          GameServerId -> (string)
              A custom string that uniquely identifies the game  server.  Game
              server  IDs are developer-defined and are unique across all game
              server groups in an AWS account.

          InstanceId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the instance where the game server  is
              running.  This ID is available in the instance metadata. EC2 in-
              stance   IDs   use   a   17-character   format,   for   example:
              i-1234567890abcdef0 .

          ConnectionInfo -> (string)
              The  port and IP address that must be used to establish a client
              connection to the game server.

          GameServerData -> (string)
              A set of custom game server properties, formatted  as  a  single
              string  value.  This  data is passed to a game client or service
              when it requests information on game  servers  using   ListGame-
              Servers or  ClaimGameServer .

          ClaimStatus -> (string)
              Indicates  when  an  available game server has been reserved for
              gameplay but has not yet started hosting  a  game.  Once  it  is
              claimed, the game server remains in CLAIMED status for a maximum
              of one minute. During this time, game  clients  connect  to  the
              game server to start the game and trigger the game server to up-
              date its utilization status. After one minute, the  game  server
              claim status reverts to null.

          UtilizationStatus -> (string)
              Indicates whether the game server is currently available for new
              games or is busy. Possible statuses include:

              o AVAILABLE - The game server is available to be claimed. A game
                server  that  has been claimed remains in this status until it
                reports game hosting activity.

              o UTILIZED - The game server is currently hosting a game session
                with players.

          RegistrationTime -> (timestamp)
              Timestamp that indicates when the game server was created with a
              RegisterGameServer request. The format is a number expressed  in
              Unix time as milliseconds (for example "1469498468.057" ).

          LastClaimTime -> (timestamp)
              Timestamp  that  indicates  the  last  time  the game server was
              claimed with a  ClaimGameServer request. The format is a  number
              expressed   in   Unix   time   as   milliseconds   (for  example
              "1469498468.057" ). This value  is  used  to  calculate  when  a
              claimed game server's status should revert to null.

          LastHealthCheckTime -> (timestamp)
              Timestamp  that  indicates the last time the game server was up-
              dated with health status using an  UpdateGameServer request. The
              format  is  a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for
              example "1469498468.057" ). After game server registration, this
              property  is  only changed when a game server update specifies a
              health check value.
