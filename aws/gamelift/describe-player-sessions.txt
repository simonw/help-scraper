DESCRIBE-PLAYER-SESSIONS()                          DESCRIBE-PLAYER-SESSIONS()



NAME
       describe-player-sessions -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves properties for one or more player sessions.

       This action can be used in the following ways:

       o To  retrieve a specific player session, provide the player session ID
         only.

       o To retrieve all player sessions in a game session, provide  the  game
         session ID only.

       o To  retrieve  all  player  sessions  for a specific player, provide a
         player ID only.

       To request player sessions, specify either a player  session  ID,  game
       session ID, or player ID. You can filter this request by player session
       status. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a  set  of
       sequential pages.

       If successful, a PlayerSession object is returned for each session that
       matches the request.
          Available in Amazon GameLift Local.

       describe-player-sessions is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: PlayerSessions

OPTIONS
       --game-session-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the game session to retrieve player sessions
          for.

       --player-id (string)
          A unique identifier for a player to retrieve player sessions for.

       --player-session-id (string)
          A unique identifier for a player session to retrieve.

       --player-session-status-filter (string)
          Player session status to filter results on.

          Possible player session statuses include the following:

          o RESERVED -- The player session request has been received, but  the
            player  has  not  yet  connected to the server process and/or been
            validated.

          o ACTIVE -- The player has been validated by the server process  and
            is currently connected.

          o COMPLETED -- The player connection has been dropped.

          o TIMEDOUT  -- A player session request was received, but the player
            did not connect and/or was not validated within the timeout  limit
            (60 seconds).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

OUTPUT
       PlayerSessions -> (list)
          A  collection  of objects containing properties for each player ses-
          sion that matches the request.

          (structure)
              Represents a player session. Player sessions are created  either
              for a specific game session, or as part of a game session place-
              ment or matchmaking request. A player session can  represents  a
              reserved  player slot in a game session (when status is RESERVED
              ) or actual player activity in a game session  (when  status  is
              ACTIVE ). A player session object, including player data, is au-
              tomatically passed to a game session when the player connects to
              the  game session and is validated. After the game session ends,
              player sessions information is retained for 30 days and then re-
              moved.

                 player session.

              GameSessionId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the game session that the player ses-
                 sion is connected to.

              FleetId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the fleet that the player's game ses-
                 sion is running on.

              FleetArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) associated with the  GameLift
                 fleet that the player's game session is running on.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  time  stamp  indicating when this data object was created.
                 Format is a number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              TerminationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A time stamp indicating when this data object was terminated.
                 Format is a number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              Status -> (string)
                 Current status of the player session.

                 Possible player session statuses include the following:

                 o RESERVED  --  The player session request has been received,
                   but the player has not yet connected to the server  process
                   and/or been validated.

                 o ACTIVE  --  The  player  has  been  validated by the server
                   process and is currently connected.

                 o COMPLETED -- The player connection has been dropped.

                 o TIMEDOUT -- A player session request was received, but  the
                   player  did not connect and/or was not validated within the
                   timeout limit (60 seconds).

              IpAddress -> (string)
                 The IP address of the game session. To connect to a  GameLift
                 game  server,  an app needs both the IP address and port num-
                 ber.

              DnsName -> (string)
                 The DNS identifier assigned to the instance that  is  running
                 the game session. Values have the following format:

                 o TLS-enabled  fleets:  <unique  identifier>.<region  identi-
                   fier>.amazongamelift.com .

                 o Non-TLS-enabled   fleets:   ec2-<unique    identifier>.com-
                   pute.amazonaws.com . (See Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing
                   .)

                 When connecting to a  game  session  that  is  running  on  a
                 TLS-enabled  fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the IP ad-
                 dress.

              Port -> (integer)
                 Port number for the game session.  To  connect  to  a  Amazon
                 GameLift server process, an app needs both the IP address and
                 port number.

              PlayerData -> (string)
                 Developer-defined information related to a  player.  GameLift
                 does  not use this data, so it can be formatted as needed for
                 use in the game.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates where to resume  retrieving  results  on  the
          next  call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results
          represent the end of the list.
