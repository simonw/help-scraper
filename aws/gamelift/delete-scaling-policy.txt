DELETE-SCALING-POLICY()                                DELETE-SCALING-POLICY()



NAME
       delete-scaling-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  fleet scaling policy. Once deleted, the policy is no longer
       in force and GameLift removes all record of it.  To  delete  a  scaling
       policy, specify both the scaling policy name and the fleet ID it is as-
       sociated with.

       To temporarily suspend scaling policies, call  StopFleetActions .  This
       operation suspends all policies for the fleet.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-scaling-policy
          --name <value>
          --fleet-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A descriptive label that is associated with a fleet's  scaling  pol-
          icy. Policy names do not need to be unique.

       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique identifier for the fleet to be deleted. You can use either
          the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
