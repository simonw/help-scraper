START-FLEET-ACTIONS()                                    START-FLEET-ACTIONS()



NAME
       start-fleet-actions -

DESCRIPTION
       Resumes  certain  types  of  activity on fleet instances that were sus-
       pended with  StopFleetActions . For multi-location  fleets,  fleet  ac-
       tions  are managed separately for each location. Currently, this opera-
       tion is used to restart a fleet's auto-scaling activity.

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To restart actions on instances in the fleet's home Region, provide a
         fleet ID and the type of actions to resume.

       o To  restart  actions  on instances in one of the fleet's remote loca-
         tions, provide a fleet ID, a location name, and the type  of  actions
         to resume.

       If  successful,  GameLift  once again initiates scaling events as trig-
       gered by the fleet's scaling policies. If actions on the fleet location
       were  never stopped, this operation will have no effect. You can view a
       fleet's  stopped  actions  using    DescribeFleetAttributes   or    De-
       scribeFleetLocationAttributes .

SYNOPSIS
            start-fleet-actions
          --fleet-id <value>
          --actions <value>
          [--location <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to restart actions on. You can use
          either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --actions (list)
          List of actions to restart on the fleet.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            AUTO_SCALING

       --location (string)
          The  fleet location to restart fleet actions for. Specify a location
          in the form of an AWS Region code, such as us-west-2 .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To restart fleet automatic scaling activity

       The  following start-fleet-actions example resumes the use of all scal-
       ing policies that are defined for the specified fleet but were  stopped
       by  calling``stop-fleet-actions``. After starting, the scaling policies
       immediately begin tracking their respective metrics.

          aws gamelift start-fleet-actions \
              --fleet-id fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111 \
              --actions AUTO_SCALING

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       FleetId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to restart actions on.

       FleetArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a GameLift fleet
          resource  and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Re-
          gions.           Format           is           arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
          gion>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912 .
