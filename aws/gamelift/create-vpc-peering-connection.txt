CREATE-VPC-PEERING-CONNECTION()                CREATE-VPC-PEERING-CONNECTION()



NAME
       create-vpc-peering-connection -

DESCRIPTION
       Establishes  a  VPC  peering connection between a virtual private cloud
       (VPC) in an Amazon Web Services account with the VPC  for  your  Amazon
       GameLift  fleet.  VPC peering enables the game servers on your fleet to
       communicate directly with other Amazon Web Services resources. You  can
       peer  with VPCs in any Amazon Web Services account that you have access
       to, including the account that you use to manage your  Amazon  GameLift
       fleets.  You  cannot  peer with VPCs that are in different Regions. For
       more information, see VPC Peering with Amazon GameLift Fleets .

       Before calling this operation to establish the peering connection,  you
       first  need to call  CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization and identify the VPC
       you want to peer with. Once the authorization for the specified VPC  is
       issued, you have 24 hours to establish the connection. These two opera-
       tions handle all tasks necessary to peer the two VPCs, including accep-
       tance, updating routing tables, etc.

       To  establish  the  connection, call this operation from the Amazon Web
       Services account that is used to manage  the  Amazon  GameLift  fleets.
       Identify  the  following values: (1) The ID of the fleet you want to be
       enable a VPC peering connection for; (2) The Amazon  Web  Services  ac-
       count  with  the  VPC that you want to peer with; and (3) The ID of the
       VPC you want to peer with. This operation is asynchronous. If  success-
       ful, a  VpcPeeringConnection request is created. You can use continuous
       polling to track the request's status using   DescribeVpcPeeringConnec-
       tions , or by monitoring fleet events for success or failure using  De-
       scribeFleetEvents .

SYNOPSIS
            create-vpc-peering-connection
          --fleet-id <value>
          --peer-vpc-aws-account-id <value>
          --peer-vpc-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the fleet. You can use either the fleet ID
          or ARN value. This tells Amazon GameLift which GameLift VPC to  peer
          with.

       --peer-vpc-aws-account-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the Amazon Web Services account with the VPC
          that you want to peer your Amazon GameLift fleet with. You can  find
          your  Account ID in the Amazon Web Services Management Console under
          account settings.

       --peer-vpc-id (string)
          A unique identifier for a VPC with resources to be accessed by  your
          GameLift fleet. The VPC must be in the same Region as your fleet. To
          look up a VPC ID, use the VPC Dashboard in the Amazon  Web  Services
          Management Console. Learn more about VPC peering in VPC Peering with
          GameLift Fleets .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
