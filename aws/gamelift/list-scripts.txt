       list-scripts is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Scripts

SYNOPSIS
            list-scripts
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Scripts -> (list)
          A set of properties describing the requested script.

          (structure)
              Properties describing a Realtime script.

              ScriptId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the Realtime script

              ScriptArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN  )  that  is  assigned to a
                 GameLift script resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are
                 unique  across all Regions. In a GameLift script ARN, the re-
                 source ID matches the ScriptId value.

              Name -> (string)
                 A descriptive label that is associated with a script.  Script
                 names do not need to be unique.

              Version -> (string)
                 Version  information  that  is  associated  with  a  build or
                 script. Version strings do not need to be unique.

              SizeOnDisk -> (long)
                 The file size of the uploaded Realtime script,  expressed  in
                 bytes.  When  files  are  uploaded  from an S3 location, this
                 value remains at "0".

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A time stamp indicating when this data  object  was  created.
                 Format  is  a  number  expressed in Unix time as milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              StorageLocation -> (structure)
                 The location in Amazon S3 where build  or  script  files  are
                 stored for access by Amazon GameLift. This location is speci-
                 fied in  CreateBuild ,  CreateScript , and  UpdateScript  re-
                 quests.

                 Bucket -> (string)
                     An  Amazon  S3 bucket identifier. This is the name of the
                     S3 bucket.

                     NOTE:
                        GameLift currently does  not  support  uploading  from
                        Amazon S3 buckets with names that contain a dot (.).

                 Key -> (string)
                     The name of the zip file that contains the build files or
                     script files.

                 RoleArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) for an IAM role that  al-
                     lows Amazon GameLift to access the S3 bucket.

                 ObjectVersion -> (string)
                     The  version  of the file, if object versioning is turned
                     on for the bucket. Amazon GameLift uses this  information
                     when retrieving files from an S3 bucket that you own. Use
                     this parameter to specify a specific version of the file.
                     If not set, the latest version of the file is retrieved.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates  where to resume retrieving results on the
          next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these  results
          represent the end of the list.
