NAME
       describe-backup-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns backup job details for the specified BackupJobId .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-backup-job
          --backup-job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --backup-job-id (string)
          Uniquely identifies a request to Backup to back up a resource.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          Returns the account ID that owns the backup job.

       BackupJobId -> (string)
          Uniquely identifies a request to Backup to back up a resource.

       BackupVaultName -> (string)
          The name of a logical container where  backups  are  stored.  Backup
          vaults  are  identified by names that are unique to the account used

          created. They consist of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

       CreationDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that a backup job is created, in Unix  format  and

          rate to milliseconds. For example, the value  1516925490.087  repre-
          sents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

       CompletionDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that a job to create a backup job is completed, in
          Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of  Com-
          pletionDate  is  accurate  to  milliseconds.  For example, the value
          1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

       State -> (string)
          The current state of a resource recovery point.

       StatusMessage -> (string)

          source.

       PercentDone -> (string)
          Contains  an  estimated  percentage that is complete of a job at the
          time the job status was queried.

       BackupSizeInBytes -> (long)
          The size, in bytes, of a backup.

       IamRoleArn -> (string)
          Specifies the IAM role ARN used to create the target recovery point;
          for example, arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access .

       CreatedBy -> (structure)
          Contains identifying information about the creation of a backup job,
          including the BackupPlanArn , BackupPlanId , BackupPlanVersion , and
          BackupRuleId of the backup plan that is used to create it.

          BackupPlanId -> (string)
              Uniquely identifies a backup plan.

          BackupPlanArn -> (string)
              An  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a backup
              plan;                        for                        example,
              arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:plan:8F81F553-3A74-4A3F-B93D-B3360DC80C50
              .

          BackupPlanVersion -> (string)
              Version IDs are unique, randomly generated, Unicode,  UTF-8  en-
              coded  strings that are at most 1,024 bytes long. They cannot be
              edited.

          BackupRuleId -> (string)
              Uniquely identifies a rule used to schedule the backup of a  se-
              lection of resources.

       ResourceType -> (string)
          The  type of Amazon Web Services resource to be backed up; for exam-
          ple, an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume or an  Amazon
          Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database.

       BytesTransferred -> (long)
          The size in bytes transferred to a backup vault at the time that the
          job status was queried.

       ExpectedCompletionDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that a job to back up resources is expected to  be
          completed,  in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The
          value of ExpectedCompletionDate is accurate to milliseconds. For ex-
          ample,  the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018
          12:11:30.087 AM.

       StartBy -> (timestamp)
          Specifies the time in Unix format  and  Coordinated  Universal  Time
          (UTC)  when  a backup job must be started before it is canceled. The
          value is calculated by adding the  start  window  to  the  scheduled
          time.  So if the scheduled time were 6:00 PM and the start window is
          2 hours, the StartBy time would be 8:00 PM on  the  date  specified.
          The  value  of StartBy is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the
          value   1516925490.087   represents   Friday,   January   26,   2018
          12:11:30.087 AM.

       BackupOptions -> (map)
          Represents the options specified as part of backup plan or on-demand
          backup job.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       BackupType -> (string)
          Represents the actual backup type selected for a backup job. For ex-
          ample,  if  a  successful  Windows  Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS)
          backup was taken, BackupType returns "WindowsVSS" . If BackupType is
          empty, then the backup type was a regular backup.
