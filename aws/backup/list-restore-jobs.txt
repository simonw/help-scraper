SYNOPSIS
            list-restore-jobs
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--by-account-id <value>]
          [--by-created-before <value>]
          [--by-created-after <value>]
          [--by-status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          The next item following a partial list of returned items. For  exam-
          ple,  if  a  request  is  made to return maxResults number of items,
          NextToken allows you to return more items in your list  starting  at
          the location pointed to by the next token.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of items to be returned.

       --by-account-id (string)
          The  account ID to list the jobs from. Returns only restore jobs as-
          sociated with the specified account ID.

       --by-created-before (timestamp)
          Returns only restore jobs that were  created  before  the  specified
          date.

       --by-created-after (timestamp)
          Returns  only  restore  jobs  that  were created after the specified
          date.

       --by-status (string)
          Returns only restore jobs associated with the specified job status.

          Possible values:

          o PENDING

          o RUNNING

          o COMPLETED

          o ABORTED

          o FAILED

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RestoreJobs -> (list)
          An array of objects that contain detailed information about jobs  to
          restore saved resources.

          (structure)
              Contains metadata about a restore job.

              AccountId -> (string)

              RecoveryPointArn -> (string)
                 An  ARN  that uniquely identifies a recovery point; for exam-
                 ple,             arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-

                 and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of  Creation-
                 Date  is  accurate  to  milliseconds.  For example, the value
                 1516925490.087   represents   Friday,   January   26,    2018

              CompletionDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and time a job to restore a recovery point is com-
                 pleted, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time  (UTC).
                 The  value of CompletionDate is accurate to milliseconds. For

                 The size, in bytes, of the restored resource.

              IamRoleArn -> (string)
                 Specifies the IAM role ARN used to create the target recovery

              ExpectedCompletionTimeMinutes -> (long)
                 The amount of time in minutes that a job restoring a recovery
                 point is expected to take.

              CreatedResourceArn -> (string)
                 An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a  re-
                 source. The format of the ARN depends on the resource type.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The resource type of the listed restore jobs; for example, an
