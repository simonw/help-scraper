DESCRIBE-RESTORE-JOB()                                  DESCRIBE-RESTORE-JOB()



NAME
       describe-restore-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  metadata  associated with a restore job that is specified by a
       job ID.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-restore-job
          --restore-job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --restore-job-id (string)
          Uniquely identifies the job that restores a recovery point.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AccountId -> (string)
          Returns the account ID that owns the restore job.

       RestoreJobId -> (string)
          Uniquely identifies the job that restores a recovery point.

       RecoveryPointArn -> (string)
          An ARN that uniquely  identifies  a  recovery  point;  for  example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-
          ery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45 .

       CreationDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that a restore job is created, in Unix format  and
          Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of CreationDate is accu-
          rate to milliseconds. For example, the value  1516925490.087  repre-
          sents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

       CompletionDate -> (timestamp)
          The  date  and  time  that a job to restore a recovery point is com-
          pleted, in Unix format and Coordinated  Universal  Time  (UTC).  The
          value  of  CompletionDate  is accurate to milliseconds. For example,
          the  value  1516925490.087  represents  Friday,  January  26,   2018
          12:11:30.087 AM.

       Status -> (string)
          Status  code  specifying  the  state of the job that is initiated by
          Backup to restore a recovery point.

       StatusMessage -> (string)
          A message showing the status of a job to restore a recovery point.

       PercentDone -> (string)
          Contains an estimated percentage that is complete of a  job  at  the
          time the job status was queried.

       BackupSizeInBytes -> (long)
          The size, in bytes, of the restored resource.

       IamRoleArn -> (string)
          Specifies the IAM role ARN used to create the target recovery point;
          for example, arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access .

       ExpectedCompletionTimeMinutes -> (long)
          The amount of time in minutes that a job restoring a recovery  point
          is expected to take.

       CreatedResourceArn -> (string)
          An  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a resource
          whose recovery point is being restored. The format of  the  ARN  de-
          pends on the resource type of the backed-up resource.

       ResourceType -> (string)
          Returns  metadata  associated  with a restore job listed by resource
          type.
