NAME
       list-report-plans -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of your report plans. For detailed information about a
       single report plan, use DescribeReportPlan .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-report-plans
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          The number of desired results from 1 to 1000. Optional. If  unspeci-
          fied, the query will return 1 MB of data.

       --next-token (string)
          An identifier that was returned from the previous call to this oper-
          ation, which can be used to return the next  set  of  items  in  the
          list.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          plan  name, description, settings, delivery channel, deployment sta-
          tus, creation time, and last times the report plan attempted to  and
          successfully ran.

                     BACKUP_JOB_REPORT | COPY_JOB_REPORT | RESTORE_JOB_REPORT

                 If  the report template is RESOURCE_COMPLIANCE_REPORT or CON-
                 TROL_COMPLIANCE_REPORT , this API resource also describes the
                 report  coverage  by  Amazon  Web Services Regions and frame-

                     are:
                        RESOURCE_COMPLIANCE_REPORT | CONTROL_COMPLIANCE_REPORT
                        |    BACKUP_JOB_REPORT   |   COPY_JOB_REPORT   |   RE-

                     /Backup/us-west-2/year/month/day/report-name.    If   not
