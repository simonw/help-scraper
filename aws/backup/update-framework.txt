SYNOPSIS
            update-framework
          --framework-name <value>
          [--framework-description <value>]
          [--framework-controls <value>]
          [--idempotency-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --framework-name (string)
          The unique name of a framework. This name is between 1 and 256 char-
          acters,  starting  with  a  letter,  and consisting of letters (a-z,
          A-Z), numbers (0-9), and underscores (_).

       --framework-description (string)
          An optional description of the framework with a maximum 1,024  char-
          acters.

       --framework-controls (list)
          A  list  of the controls that make up the framework. Each control in
          the list has a name, input parameters, and scope.

          (structure)
              Contains detailed information about all of  the  controls  of  a
              framework. Each framework must contain at least one control.

              ControlName -> (string)
                 The name of a control. This name is between 1 and 256 charac-
                 ters.

              ControlInputParameters -> (list)
                 A list of ParameterName and ParameterValue pairs.

                 (structure)
                     A list of parameters for a control. A  control  can  have
                     zero,  one,  or  more than one parameter. An example of a
                     control with two parameters is: "backup plan frequency is
                     at  least  daily  and  the retention period is at least 1
                     year ". The first parameter is daily . The second parame-
                     ter is 1 year .

                     ParameterName -> (string)
                        The  name  of a parameter, for example, BackupPlanFre-
                        quency .

                     ParameterValue -> (string)
                        The value of parameter, for example, hourly .

              ControlScope -> (structure)
                 The scope of a control. The control scope  defines  what  the
                 control  will evaluate. Three examples of control scopes are:
                 a specific backup plan, all backup plans with a specific tag,
                 or all backup plans. For more information, see ` ControlScope
                 . <aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_ControlScope.html>`__

                 ComplianceResourceIds -> (list)
                     The ID of the only Amazon Web Services resource that  you
                     want your control scope to contain.

                     (string)

                 ComplianceResourceTypes -> (list)
                     Describes  whether the control scope includes one or more
                     types of resources, such as EFS or RDS .

                     (string)

                 Tags -> (map)
                     The tag key-value pair applied to those Amazon  Web  Ser-
                     vices  resources  that  you want to trigger an evaluation
                     for a rule. A maximum of one key-value pair can  be  pro-
                     vided.  The  tag  value  is optional, but it cannot be an
                     empty  string.  The  structure  to  assign  a   tag   is:
                     [{"Key":"string","Value":"string"}] .

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ControlName=string,ControlInputParameters=[{ParameterName=string,ParameterValue=string},{ParameterName=string,ParameterValue=string}],ControlScope={ComplianceResourceIds=[string,string],ComplianceResourceTypes=[string,string],Tags={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string}} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ControlName": "string",
              "ControlInputParameters": [
                {
                  "ParameterName": "string",
                  "ParameterValue": "string"
                }
                ...
              ],
              "ControlScope": {
                "ComplianceResourceIds": ["string", ...],
                "ComplianceResourceTypes": ["string", ...],
                "Tags": {"string": "string"
                  ...}
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --idempotency-token (string)
          A  customer-chosen  string  that  you can use to distinguish between
          otherwise identical calls to UpdateFrameworkInput . Retrying a  suc-
          cessful request with the same idempotency token results in a success
          message with no action taken.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FrameworkName -> (string)
          The unique name of a framework. This name is between 1 and 256 char-
          acters, starting with a letter,  and  consisting  of  letters  (a-z,
          A-Z), numbers (0-9), and underscores (_).

       FrameworkArn -> (string)
          An  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a resource.
          The format of the ARN depends on the resource type.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that a framework is created, in  Unix  format  and
          Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of CreationTime is accu-
          rate to milliseconds. For example, the value  1516925490.087  repre-
          sents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.
