NAME
       create-backup-selection -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a JSON document that specifies a set of resources to assign to
       a backup plan. For examples, see Assigning resources programmatically .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-backup-selection
          --backup-plan-id <value>
          --backup-selection <value>
          [--creator-request-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --backup-plan-id (string)
          Uniquely identifies the backup plan to be associated with the selec-
          tion of resources.

       --backup-selection (structure)
          Specifies  the  body  of a request to assign a set of resources to a
          backup plan.

          SelectionName -> (string)
              The display name of a resource selection document. Must  contain
              1 to 50 alphanumeric or '-_.' characters.

          IamRoleArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  of  the IAM role that Backup uses to authenticate when
              backing    up    the    target    resource;     for     example,
              arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access .

          Resources -> (list)
              A  list  of  Amazon  Resource Names (ARNs) to assign to a backup
              plan. The maximum number of ARNs is 500 without wildcards, or 30
              ARNs with wildcards.

              If  you need to assign many resources to a backup plan, consider
              a different resource selection strategy, such as  assigning  all
              resources of a resource type or refining your resource selection
              using tags.

              (string)

          ListOfTags -> (list)
              A list of conditions that you define to assign resources to your
              backup  plans using tags. For example, "StringEquals": { "Condi-
              tionKey":   "aws:ResourceTag/CreatedByCryo",   "ConditionValue":
              "true" }, . Condition operators are case sensitive.
                 ListOfTags differs from Conditions as follows:

              o When  you  specify more than one condition, you assign all re-
                sources that match AT LEAST ONE condition (using OR logic).

              o ListOfTags only supports StringEquals  .  Conditions  supports
                StringEquals  ,  StringLike , StringNotEquals , and StringNot-
                Like .

              (structure)
                 Contains an array of triplets made up  of  a  condition  type
                 (such  as  StringEquals ), a key, and a value. Used to filter
                 resources using their tags and assign them to a backup  plan.
                 Case sensitive.

                 ConditionType -> (string)
                     An  operation  applied to a key-value pair used to assign
                     resources to your backup plan.  Condition  only  supports
                     StringEquals  . For more flexible assignment options, in-
                     cluding StringLike and the ability to  exclude  resources
                     from your backup plan, use Conditions (with an "s" on the
                     end)       for       your        `        BackupSelection
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_BackupSelection.html`__
                     .

                 ConditionKey -> (string)
                     The key in a key-value pair. For example, in the tag  De-
                     partment: Accounting , Department is the key.

                 ConditionValue -> (string)
                     The  value  in  a key-value pair. For example, in the tag
                     Department: Accounting , Accounting is the value.

          NotResources -> (list)
              A list of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to exclude from a  backup
              plan. The maximum number of ARNs is 500 without wildcards, or 30
              ARNs with wildcards.

              If you need to exclude many resources from a backup  plan,  con-
              sider a different resource selection strategy, such as assigning
              only one or a few resource types or refining your  resource  se-
              lection using tags.

              (string)

          Conditions -> (structure)
              A list of conditions that you define to assign resources to your
              backup plans using tags. For example, "StringEquals": {  "Condi-
              tionKey":   "aws:ResourceTag/CreatedByCryo",   "ConditionValue":
              "true" }, . Condition operators are case sensitive.
                 Conditions differs from ListOfTags as follows:

              o When you specify more than one condition, you only assign  the
                resources that match ALL conditions (using AND logic).

              o Conditions  supports  StringEquals  , StringLike , StringNotE-
                quals , and StringNotLike . ListOfTags only supports  StringE-
                quals .

              StringEquals -> (list)
                 Filters  the  values  of your tagged resources for only those
                 resources that you tagged with the same  value.  Also  called
                 "exact matching."

                 (structure)
                     Includes  information  about  tags  you  define to assign
                     tagged resources to a backup plan.

                     ConditionKey -> (string)
                        The key in a key-value pair. For example, in  the  tag

                     ConditionValue -> (string)
                        The value in a key-value pair. For example, in the tag
                        Department: Accounting , Accounting is the value.

              StringNotEquals -> (list)
                 Filters the values of your tagged resources  for  only  those
                 resources  that  you  tagged that do not have the same value.
                 Also called "negated matching."

                 (structure)
                     Includes information about  tags  you  define  to  assign

              StringLike -> (list)
                 Filters  the values of your tagged resources for matching tag
                 values with the use of a wildcard character (*)  anywhere  in
                 the  string.  For  example,  "prod*" or "rod" matches the tag
                 value "production".

                 (structure)
                     Includes information about  tags  you  define  to  assign
                     tagged resources to a backup plan.

                     ConditionKey -> (string)
                        The  key  in a key-value pair. For example, in the tag

       --creator-request-id (string)
          A unique string that identifies the request and  allows  failed  re-
          quests  to  be  retried  without  the  risk of running the operation
          twice. This parameter is optional.

          If used, this parameter must contain 1 to 50 alphanumeric  or  '-_.'
          characters.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SelectionId -> (string)
          Uniquely identifies the body of a request to assign  a  set  of  re-
          sources to a backup plan.

       BackupPlanId -> (string)
          Uniquely identifies a backup plan.

       CreationDate -> (timestamp)
          The  date and time a backup selection is created, in Unix format and
          Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of CreationDate is accu-
          rate  to  milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 repre-
          sents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.
