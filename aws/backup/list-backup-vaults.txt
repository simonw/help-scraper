LIST-BACKUP-VAULTS()                                      LIST-BACKUP-VAULTS()



NAME
       list-backup-vaults -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of recovery point storage containers along with informa-
       tion about them.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-backup-vaults
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          The next item following a partial list of returned items. For  exam-
          ple,  if  a  request  is  made to return maxResults number of items,
          NextToken allows you to return more items in your list  starting  at
          the location pointed to by the next token.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of items to be returned.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       BackupVaultList -> (list)
          An array of backup vault list members containing vault metadata, in-
          cluding Amazon Resource Name (ARN),  display  name,  creation  date,
          number  of  saved recovery points, and encryption information if the
          resources saved in the backup vault are encrypted.

          (structure)
              Contains metadata about a backup vault.

              BackupVaultName -> (string)
                 The name of a logical container  where  backups  are  stored.
                 Backup  vaults are identified by names that are unique to the
                 account used to create them and the Amazon Web  Services  Re-
                 gion  where  they are created. They consist of lowercase let-
                 ters, numbers, and hyphens.

              BackupVaultArn -> (string)
                 An Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  that  uniquely  identifies  a
                 backup             vault;             for            example,
                 arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:vault:aBackupVault .

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time a resource backup is created, in Unix  for-
                 mat  and  Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of Cre-
                 ationDate is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value
                 1516925490.087    represents   Friday,   January   26,   2018
                 12:11:30.087 AM.

              EncryptionKeyArn -> (string)
                 The server-side encryption key that is used to  protect  your
                 backups;                     for                     example,
                 arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
                 .

              CreatorRequestId -> (string)
                 A unique string that identifies the request and allows failed
                 requests to be retried without the risk of running the opera-
                 tion twice. This parameter is optional.

                 If  used, this parameter must contain 1 to 50 alphanumeric or
                 '-_.' characters.

              NumberOfRecoveryPoints -> (long)
                 The number of recovery points that are  stored  in  a  backup
                 vault.

              Locked -> (boolean)
                 A  Boolean value that indicates whether Backup Vault Lock ap-
                 plies to the selected backup vault. If true , Vault Lock pre-
                 vents  delete and update operations on the recovery points in
                 the selected vault.

              MinRetentionDays -> (long)
                 The Backup Vault Lock setting that specifies the minimum  re-
                 tention period that the vault retains its recovery points. If
                 this parameter is not specified, Vault Lock does not  enforce
                 a minimum retention period.

                 If specified, any backup or copy job to the vault must have a
                 lifecycle policy with a retention period equal to  or  longer
                 than the minimum retention period. If the job's retention pe-
                 riod is shorter than that minimum retention period, then  the
                 vault  fails  the  backup  or copy job, and you should either
                 modify your lifecycle settings or use a different vault.  Re-
                 covery points already stored in the vault prior to Vault Lock
                 are not affected.

              MaxRetentionDays -> (long)
                 The Backup Vault Lock setting that specifies the maximum  re-
                 tention period that the vault retains its recovery points. If
                 this parameter is not specified, Vault Lock does not  enforce
                 a  maximum  retention  period  on  the recovery points in the
                 vault (allowing indefinite storage).

                 If specified, any backup or copy job to the vault must have a
                 lifecycle  policy with a retention period equal to or shorter
                 than the maximum retention period. If the job's retention pe-
                 riod  is  longer than that maximum retention period, then the
                 vault fails the backup or copy job,  and  you  should  either
                 modify  your lifecycle settings or use a different vault. Re-
                 covery points already stored in the vault prior to Vault Lock
                 are not affected.

              LockDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time when Backup Vault Lock configuration be-
                 comes immutable, meaning it cannot be changed or deleted.

                 If you applied Vault Lock to your vault without specifying  a
                 lock date, you can change your Vault Lock settings, or delete
                 Vault Lock from the vault entirely, at any time.

                 This value is in  Unix  format,  Coordinated  Universal  Time
                 (UTC),  and  accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value
                 1516925490.087   represents   Friday,   January   26,    2018
                 12:11:30.087 AM.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  next item following a partial list of returned items. For exam-
          ple, if a request is made to  return  maxResults  number  of  items,
          NextToken  allows  you to return more items in your list starting at
          the location pointed to by the next token.
