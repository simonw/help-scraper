GET-BACKUP-SELECTION()                                  GET-BACKUP-SELECTION()



NAME
       get-backup-selection -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns selection metadata and a document in JSON format that specifies
       a list of resources that are associated with a backup plan.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-backup-selection
          --backup-plan-id <value>
          --selection-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --backup-plan-id (string)
          Uniquely identifies a backup plan.

       --selection-id (string)
          Uniquely identifies the body of a request to assign  a  set  of  re-
          sources to a backup plan.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       BackupSelection -> (structure)
          Specifies  the  body  of a request to assign a set of resources to a
          backup plan.

          SelectionName -> (string)
              The display name of a resource selection document. Must  contain
              1 to 50 alphanumeric or '-_.' characters.

          IamRoleArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  of  the IAM role that Backup uses to authenticate when
              backing    up    the    target    resource;     for     example,
              arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access .

          Resources -> (list)
              A  list  of  Amazon  Resource Names (ARNs) to assign to a backup
              plan. The maximum number of ARNs is 500 without wildcards, or 30
              ARNs with wildcards.

              If  you need to assign many resources to a backup plan, consider
              a different resource selection strategy, such as  assigning  all
              resources of a resource type or refining your resource selection
              using tags.

              (string)

          ListOfTags -> (list)
              A list of conditions that you define to assign resources to your
              backup  plans using tags. For example, "StringEquals": {"Depart-
              ment": "accounting" . Condition operators are case sensitive.
                 ListOfTags differs from Conditions as follows:

              o When you specify more than one condition, you assign  all  re-
                sources that match AT LEAST ONE condition (using OR logic).

              o ListOfTags  only  supports  StringEquals . Conditions supports
                StringEquals , StringLike , StringNotEquals ,  and  StringNot-
                Like .

              (structure)
                 Contains  an  array  of  triplets made up of a condition type
                 (such as StringEquals ), a key, and a value. Used  to  filter
                 resources  using their tags and assign them to a backup plan.
                 Case sensitive.

                 ConditionType -> (string)
                     An operation applied to a key-value pair used  to  assign
                     resources  to  your  backup plan. Condition only supports
                     StringEquals . For more flexible assignment options,  in-
                     cluidng  StringLike  and the ability to exclude resources
                     from your backup plan, use Conditions (with an "s" on the
                     end)        for        your       `       BackupSelection
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_BackupSelection.html`__
                     .

                 ConditionKey -> (string)
                     The  key in a key-value pair. For example, in the tag De-
                     partment: Accounting , Department is the key.

                 ConditionValue -> (string)
                     The value in a key-value pair. For example,  in  the  tag
                     Department: Accounting , Accounting is the value.

          NotResources -> (list)
              A  list of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to exclude from a backup
              plan. The maximum number of ARNs is 500 without wildcards, or 30
              ARNs with wildcards.

              If  you  need to exclude many resources from a backup plan, con-
              sider a different resource selection strategy, such as assigning
              only  one  or a few resource types or refining your resource se-
              lection using tags.

              (string)

          Conditions -> (structure)
              A list of conditions that you define to assign resources to your
              backup  plans using tags. For example, "StringEquals": {"Depart-
              ment": "accounting" . Condition operators are case sensitive.
                 Conditions differs from ListOfTags as follows:

              o When you specify more than one condition, you only assign  the
                resources that match ALL conditions (using AND logic).

              o Conditions  supports  StringEquals  , StringLike , StringNotE-
                quals , and StringNotLike . ListOfTags only supports  StringE-
                quals .

              StringEquals -> (list)
                 Filters  the  values  of your tagged resources for only those
                 resources that you tagged with the same  value.  Also  called
                 "exact matching."

                 (structure)
                     Includes  information  about  tags  you  define to assign
                     tagged resources to a backup plan.

                     ConditionKey -> (string)
                        The key in a key-value pair. For example, in  the  tag

                     ConditionValue -> (string)
                        The value in a key-value pair. For example, in the tag
                        Department: Accounting , Accounting is the value.

              StringNotEquals -> (list)
                 Filters the values of your tagged resources  for  only  those
                 resources  that  you  tagged that do not have the same value.
                 Also called "negated matching."

                 (structure)
                     Includes information about  tags  you  define  to  assign
                     tagged resources to a backup plan.

                     ConditionKey -> (string)
                        The  key  in a key-value pair. For example, in the tag

                     ConditionValue -> (string)
                        The value in a key-value pair. For example, in the tag

              StringLike -> (list)
                 Filters  the values of your tagged resources for matching tag
                 values with the use of a wildcard character (*)  anywhere  in
                 the  string.  For  example,  "prod*" or "rod" matches the tag
                 value "production".

                 (structure)
                     Includes information about  tags  you  define  to  assign
                     tagged resources to a backup plan.

                     ConditionKey -> (string)
                        The  key  in a key-value pair. For example, in the tag

              StringNotLike -> (list)
                 Filters  the values of your tagged resources for non-matching
                 tag values with the use of a wildcard character (*)  anywhere
                 in the string.

                 (structure)
                     Includes  information  about  tags  you  define to assign
                     tagged resources to a backup plan.

                     ConditionKey -> (string)
                        The key in a key-value pair. For example, in  the  tag

          rate  to  milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 repre-
          sents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.
