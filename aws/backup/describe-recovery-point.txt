       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-recovery-point
          --backup-vault-name <value>
          --recovery-point-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --backup-vault-name (string)
          The name of a logical container where  backups  are  stored.  Backup
          vaults  are  identified by names that are unique to the account used
          to create them and the Amazon Web Services  Region  where  they  are
          created. They consist of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

       --recovery-point-arn (string)
          An  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a recovery
          point;  for  example,   arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-
          ery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45 .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RecoveryPointArn -> (string)
          An  ARN  that  uniquely  identifies  a  recovery point; for example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-

       BackupVaultName -> (string)
          The  name  of  a  logical container where backups are stored. Backup
          vaults are identified by names that are unique to the  account  used
          to  create  them and the Region where they are created. They consist
          of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

       BackupVaultArn -> (string)
          An ARN  that  uniquely  identifies  a  backup  vault;  for  example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:vault:aBackupVault .

       SourceBackupVaultArn -> (string)
          An  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the source
          vault where the resource was originally backed up in;  for  example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:vault:BackupVault . If the re-
          covery is restored to the same Amazon Web Services  account  or  Re-
          gion, this value will be null .

       ResourceArn -> (string)
          An  ARN that uniquely identifies a saved resource. The format of the
          ARN depends on the resource type.

       ResourceType -> (string)
          The type of Amazon Web Services  resource  to  save  as  a  recovery
          point;  for example, an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) vol-
          ume or an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database.

       CreatedBy -> (structure)
          Contains identifying information about the creation  of  a  recovery
          point,  including  the BackupPlanArn , BackupPlanId , BackupPlanVer-
          sion , and BackupRuleId of the backup plan used to create it.

          BackupPlanId -> (string)
              Uniquely identifies a backup plan.

          BackupPlanArn -> (string)
              An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a  backup
              plan;                        for                        example,
              arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:plan:8F81F553-3A74-4A3F-B93D-B3360DC80C50
              .

          BackupPlanVersion -> (string)
              Version  IDs  are unique, randomly generated, Unicode, UTF-8 en-
              coded strings that are at most 1,024 bytes long. They cannot  be
              edited.

          BackupRuleId -> (string)
              Uniquely  identifies a rule used to schedule the backup of a se-
              lection of resources.

       IamRoleArn -> (string)
          Specifies the IAM role ARN used to create the target recovery point;
          for example, arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access .

       Status -> (string)
          A status code specifying the state of the recovery point.
              PARTIAL  status  indicates  Backup could not create the recovery
              point before the backup window closed. To increase  your  backup
              plan  window  using the API, see UpdateBackupPlan . You can also
              increase your backup plan window using the Console  by  choosing
              and editing your backup plan.

              EXPIRED  status  indicates  that the recovery point has exceeded
              its retention period, but Backup lacks permission or  is  other-
              wise  unable  to  delete  it.  To manually delete these recovery
              points, see Step 3: Delete the recovery points in the  Clean  up
              resources section of Getting started .

       StatusMessage -> (string)
          A  status message explaining the reason for the recovery point dele-
          tion failure.

       CreationDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that a recovery point is created, in  Unix  format
          and  Coordinated  Universal Time (UTC). The value of CreationDate is
          accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 rep-
          resents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

       CompletionDate -> (timestamp)
          The  date  and  time  that  a job to create a recovery point is com-
          pleted, in Unix format and Coordinated  Universal  Time  (UTC).  The
          value  of  CompletionDate  is accurate to milliseconds. For example,
          the  value  1516925490.087  represents  Friday,  January  26,   2018
          12:11:30.087 AM.

       BackupSizeInBytes -> (long)
          The size, in bytes, of a backup.

       CalculatedLifecycle -> (structure)
          A CalculatedLifecycle object containing DeleteAt and MoveToColdStor-
          ageAt timestamps.

          MoveToColdStorageAt -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp that specifies when to transition a  recovery  point
              to cold storage.

          DeleteAt -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp that specifies when to delete a recovery point.

       Lifecycle -> (structure)
          The  lifecycle  defines when a protected resource is transitioned to
          cold storage and when it expires.  Backup  transitions  and  expires
          backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.

          Backups that are transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold
          storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the expire  after  days
          setting  must  be  90 days greater than the transition to cold after
          days setting. The transition to cold after days  setting  cannot  be
          changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold.

          Only  Amazon  EFS  file  system  backups can be transitioned to cold
          storage.

          MoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)
              Specifies the number of days  after  creation  that  a  recovery
              point is moved to cold storage.

          DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
              Specifies  the  number  of  days  after creation that a recovery
              point is deleted. Must be greater than 90 days plus  MoveToCold-
              StorageAfterDays .

       EncryptionKeyArn -> (string)
          The server-side encryption key used to protect your backups; for ex-
          ample,
          arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
          .

       IsEncrypted -> (boolean)
          A Boolean value that is returned as TRUE if the  specified  recovery
          point is encrypted, or FALSE if the recovery point is not encrypted.

       StorageClass -> (string)
          Specifies  the storage class of the recovery point. Valid values are
          WARM or COLD .

       LastRestoreTime -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that a recovery point was last restored,  in  Unix
          format  and  Coordinated  Universal Time (UTC). The value of LastRe-
          storeTime is  accurate  to  milliseconds.  For  example,  the  value
          1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.
