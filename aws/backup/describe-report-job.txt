DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  details associated with creating a report as specified by
       its ReportJobId .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-report-job
          --report-job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --report-job-id (string)
          The identifier of the report job. A unique, randomly generated, Uni-
          code, UTF-8 encoded string that is at most 1,024 bytes long. The re-
          port job ID cannot be edited.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          Resource Name (ARN), report template, status, and status message.

          ReportJobId -> (string)
              The  identifier  for a report job. A unique, randomly generated,
              Unicode, UTF-8 encoded string that is at most 1,024 bytes  long.
              Report job IDs cannot be edited.

          ReportPlanArn -> (string)

              The date and time that a report job is created, in  Unix  format
              and  Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of CreationTime
              is  accurate   to   milliseconds.   For   example,   the   value
              1516925490.087  represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087
