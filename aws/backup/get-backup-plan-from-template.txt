GET-BACKUP-PLAN-FROM-TEMPLATE()                GET-BACKUP-PLAN-FROM-TEMPLATE()



NAME
       get-backup-plan-from-template -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the template specified by its templateId as a backup plan.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-backup-plan-from-template
          --backup-plan-template-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --backup-plan-template-id (string)
          Uniquely identifies a stored backup plan template.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get an existing backup plan from a template

       The  following  get-backup-plan-from-template  example gets an existing
       backup plan from a template that specifies a daily backup with a 35 day
       retention.

          aws backup get-backup-plan-from-template \
              --backup-plan-template-id "87c0c1ef-254d-4180-8fef-2e76a2c38aaa"

       Output:

          {
              "BackupPlanDocument": {
                  "Rules": [
                      {
                          "RuleName": "DailyBackups",
                          "ScheduleExpression": "cron(0 5 ? * * *)",
                          "StartWindowMinutes": 480,
                          "Lifecycle": {
                              "DeleteAfterDays": 35
                          }
                      }
                  ]
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       BackupPlanDocument -> (structure)
          Returns the body of a backup plan based on the target template,  in-
          cluding the name, rules, and backup vault of the plan.

          BackupPlanName -> (string)
              The display name of a backup plan. Must contain 1 to 50 alphanu-
              meric or '-_.' characters.

          Rules -> (list)
              An array of BackupRule objects, each of which specifies a sched-
              uled task that is used to back up a selection of resources.

              (structure)
                 Specifies a scheduled task used to back up a selection of re-
                 sources.

                 RuleName -> (string)
                     A display name for a backup rule. Must contain  1  to  50
                     alphanumeric or '-_.' characters.

                 TargetBackupVaultName -> (string)
                     The name of a logical container where backups are stored.
                     Backup vaults are identified by names that are unique  to
                     the  account  used to create them and the Amazon Web Ser-
                     vices Region where they are created. They consist of low-
                     ercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

                 ScheduleExpression -> (string)
                     A cron expression in UTC specifying when Backup initiates
                     a backup job. For more information about Amazon Web  Ser-
                     vices  cron  expressions,  see  Schedule  Expressions for
                     Rules in the Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide.  .  Two
                     examples of Amazon Web Services cron expressions are 15 *
                     ? * * * (take a backup every hour at 15 minutes past  the
                     hour)  and  0  12  * * ? * (take a backup every day at 12
                     noon UTC). For a table of examples, click  the  preceding
                     link and scroll down the page.

                 StartWindowMinutes -> (long)
                     A  value  in minutes after a backup is scheduled before a
                     job will be canceled if it  doesn't  start  successfully.
                     This value is optional.

                 CompletionWindowMinutes -> (long)
                     A  value  in  minutes  after a backup job is successfully
                     started before it must be completed or it  will  be  can-
                     celed by Backup. This value is optional.

                 Lifecycle -> (structure)
                     The  lifecycle defines when a protected resource is tran-
                     sitioned to cold storage  and  when  it  expires.  Backup
                     transitions  and  expires backups automatically according
                     to the lifecycle that you define.

                     Backups transitioned to cold storage must  be  stored  in
                     cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the ex-
                     pire after days setting must be 90 days greater than  the
                     transition  to cold after days setting. The transition to
                     cold after days setting cannot be changed after a  backup
                     has been transitioned to cold.

                     Only  Amazon  EFS file system backups can be transitioned
                     to cold storage.

                     MoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)
                        Specifies the number of days after creation that a re-
                        covery point is moved to cold storage.

                     DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
                        Specifies the number of days after creation that a re-
                        covery point is deleted. Must be greater than 90  days
                        plus MoveToColdStorageAfterDays .

                 RecoveryPointTags -> (map)
                     An  array  of key-value pair strings that are assigned to
                     resources that are associated with  this  rule  when  re-
                     stored from backup.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 RuleId -> (string)
                     Uniquely  identifies  a rule that is used to schedule the
                     backup of a selection of resources.

                 CopyActions -> (list)
                     An array of CopyAction objects, which  contains  the  de-
                     tails of the copy operation.

                     (structure)
                        The details of the copy operation.

                        Lifecycle -> (structure)
                            Contains an array of Transition objects specifying
                            how long in days before a recovery  point  transi-
                            tions to cold storage or is deleted.

                            Backups  transitioned  to  cold  storage  must  be
                            stored in cold storage for a minimum of  90  days.
                            Therefore,  on  the console, the expire after days
                            setting must be 90 days greater than  the  transi-
                            tion to cold after days setting. The transition to
                            cold after days setting cannot be changed after  a
                            backup has been transitioned to cold.

                            Only Amazon EFS file system backups can be transi-
                            tioned to cold storage.

                            MoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)
                               Specifies the number  of  days  after  creation
                               that a recovery point is moved to cold storage.

                            DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
                               Specifies  the  number  of  days after creation
                               that a  recovery  point  is  deleted.  Must  be
                               greater  than 90 days plus MoveToColdStorageAf-
                               terDays .

                        DestinationBackupVaultArn -> (string)
                            An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely  iden-
                            tifies the destination backup vault for the copied
                            backup.                For                example,
                            arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:vault:aBack-
                            upVault .

                 EnableContinuousBackup -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether Backup creates continuous backups. True
                     causes  Backup  to  create  continuous backups capable of
                     point-in-time restore (PITR). False  (or  not  specified)
                     causes Backup to create snapshot backups.

          AdvancedBackupSettings -> (list)
              Contains a list of BackupOptions for each resource type.

              (structure)
                 A list of backup options for each resource type.

                 ResourceType -> (string)
                     Specifies  an  object containing resource type and backup
                     options. The only supported resource type is  Amazon  EC2
                     instances  with Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS).

                     tion  template  to  enable Windows VSS in the Backup User
                     Guide .

                     Valid values: EC2 .

                 BackupOptions -> (map)
                     Specifies the backup option for a selected resource. This
                     option is only available for Windows VSS backup jobs.

                     Valid values:

                     Set  to  "WindowsVSS":"enabled"  to enable the WindowsVSS
                     backup option and create a Windows VSS backup.

                     Set  to  "WindowsVSS":"disabled"  to  create  a   regular
                     backup. The WindowsVSS option is not enabled by default.

                     If  you  specify an invalid option, you get an InvalidPa-
                     rameterValueException exception.
