NAME
       list-recovery-points-by-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  detailed information about all the recovery points of the type
       specified by a resource Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

       NOTE:
          For Amazon EFS and Amazon  EC2,  this  action  only  lists  recovery
          points created by Backup.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-recovery-points-by-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          An  ARN  that  uniquely identifies a resource. The format of the ARN
          depends on the resource type.

       --next-token (string)
          The next item following a partial list of returned items. For  exam-
          ple,  if  a  request  is  made to return maxResults number of items,
          NextToken allows you to return more items in your list  starting  at
          the location pointed to by the next token.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of items to be returned.

          NOTE:
              Amazon RDS requires a value of at least 20.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The  next item following a partial list of returned items. For exam-
          ple, if a request is made to  return  maxResults  number  of  items,
          NextToken  allows  you to return more items in your list starting at
          the location pointed to by the next token.

       RecoveryPoints -> (list)
          An array of objects that contain detailed information about recovery
          points of the specified resource type.

          NOTE:
              Only  Amazon  EFS  and Amazon EC2 recovery points return Backup-
              VaultName.

          (structure)
              Contains detailed information about a saved recovery point.

              RecoveryPointArn -> (string)
                 An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a  re-
                 covery             point;             for            example,
                 arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-
                 ery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45 .

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time a recovery point is created, in Unix format
                 and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of  Creation-
                 Date  is  accurate  to  milliseconds.  For example, the value
                 1516925490.087   represents   Friday,   January   26,    2018
                 12:11:30.087 AM.

              Status -> (string)
                 A status code specifying the state of the recovery point.

              StatusMessage -> (string)
                 A  message  explaining the reason of the recovery point dele-
                 tion failure.

              EncryptionKeyArn -> (string)
                 The server-side encryption key that is used to  protect  your
                 backups;                     for                     example,
                 arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
                 .

              BackupSizeBytes -> (long)
                 The size, in bytes, of a backup.

              BackupVaultName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  a  logical container where backups are stored.
                 Backup vaults are identified by names that are unique to  the
                 account  used  to create them and the Amazon Web Services Re-
                 gion where they are created. They consist of  lowercase  let-
                 ters, numbers, and hyphens.
