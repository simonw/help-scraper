OPTIONS
       --backup-vault-name (string)
          The  name  of  a  logical container where backups are stored. Backup
          vaults are identified by names that are unique to the  account  used
          to  create  them  and  the Amazon Web Services Region where they are
          created. They consist of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

       --resource-arn (string)
          An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies  a  resource.
          The format of the ARN depends on the resource type.

       --iam-role-arn (string)
          Specifies the IAM role ARN used to create the target recovery point;
          for example, arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access .

       --idempotency-token (string)
          A customer-chosen string that you can  use  to  distinguish  between
          otherwise  identical calls to StartBackupJob . Retrying a successful
          request with the same idempotency token results in a success message
          with no action taken.

       --start-window-minutes (long)
          A  value in minutes after a backup is scheduled before a job will be
          canceled if it doesn't start successfully. This value  is  optional,
          and the default is 8 hours.

       --complete-window-minutes (long)
          A  value  in minutes during which a successfully started backup must
          complete, or else Backup will cancel the  job.  This  value  is  op-
          tional.  This  value  begins  counting down from when the backup was
          scheduled. It does not add additional time for StartWindowMinutes  ,
          or if the backup started later than scheduled.

       --lifecycle (structure)
          The  lifecycle  defines when a protected resource is transitioned to
          cold storage and when it expires. Backup will transition and  expire
          backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.

          Backups  transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage
          for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the retention setting  must  be
          90  days greater than the transition to cold after days setting. The
          transition to cold after days setting  cannot  be  changed  after  a
          backup has been transitioned to cold.

          Only  resource types that support full Backup management can transi-
          tion their backups to cold storage. Those resource types are  listed
          in  the "Full Backup management" section of the Feature availability
          by resource table. Backup ignores this expression for other resource
          types.

          MoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)
              Specifies  the  number  of  days  after creation that a recovery
              point is moved to cold storage.

          DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
              Specifies the number of days  after  creation  that  a  recovery
              point  is deleted. Must be greater than 90 days plus MoveToCold-
              StorageAfterDays .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MoveToColdStorageAfterDays=long,DeleteAfterDays=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MoveToColdStorageAfterDays": long,
            "DeleteAfterDays": long
          }

       --recovery-point-tags (map)
          To help organize your resources, you can assign your own metadata to
          the resources that you create. Each tag is a key-value pair.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --backup-options (map)
          Specifies  the backup option for a selected resource. This option is
          only available for Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service  (VSS)  backup
          jobs.

          Valid values: Set to "WindowsVSS":"enabled" to enable the WindowsVSS
          backup option  and  create  a  Windows  VSS  backup.  Set  to  "Win-
          dowsVSS""disabled" to create a regular backup. The WindowsVSS option
          is not enabled by default.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       BackupJobId -> (string)
          Uniquely identifies a request to Backup to back up a resource.

       RecoveryPointArn -> (string)
          An  ARN  that  uniquely  identifies  a  recovery point; for example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-
          ery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45 .

       CreationDate -> (timestamp)
          The  date  and time that a backup job is created, in Unix format and
          Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of CreationDate is accu-
          rate  to  milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 repre-
          sents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.
