NAME
       list-recovery-points-by-backup-vault -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  detailed  information  about  the  recovery points stored in a
       backup vault.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-recovery-points-by-backup-vault is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: RecoveryPoints

OPTIONS
       --backup-vault-name (string)
          The  name  of  a  logical container where backups are stored. Backup
          vaults are identified by names that are unique to the  account  used
          to  create  them  and  the Amazon Web Services Region where they are
          created. They consist of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

          NOTE:
              Backup vault name might not be available when a  supported  ser-
              vice creates the backup.

       --by-resource-arn (string)
          Returns  only recovery points that match the specified resource Ama-
          zon Resource Name (ARN).

       --by-resource-type (string)
          Returns only recovery points that match the specified resource type.

       --by-backup-plan-id (string)
          Returns only recovery points that match the  specified  backup  plan
          ID.

       --by-created-before (timestamp)
          Returns  only recovery points that were created before the specified
          timestamp.

       --by-created-after (timestamp)
          Returns only recovery points that were created after  the  specified
          timestamp.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The  next item following a partial list of returned items. For exam-
          ple, if a request is made to  return  maxResults  number  of  items,
          NextToken  allows  you to return more items in your list starting at
          the location pointed to by the next token.

       RecoveryPoints -> (list)
          An array of objects that contain detailed information about recovery
          points saved in a backup vault.

                 tion failure.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time a recovery point is created, in Unix format
                 and  Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of Creation-
                 Date is accurate to  milliseconds.  For  example,  the  value
                 1516925490.087    represents   Friday,   January   26,   2018
                 12:11:30.087 AM.

              CompletionDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time a job to restore a recovery point  is  com-
                 pleted,  in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
                 The value of CompletionDate is accurate to milliseconds.  For

                 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

              BackupSizeInBytes -> (long)
                 The size, in bytes, of a backup.

              CalculatedLifecycle -> (structure)
                 A CalculatedLifecycle object containing DeleteAt and  MoveTo-
                 ColdStorageAt timestamps.

                 MoveToColdStorageAt -> (timestamp)
                     A  timestamp that specifies when to transition a recovery
                     point to cold storage.

                 DeleteAt -> (timestamp)
                     A timestamp that specifies  when  to  delete  a  recovery
                     point.

              Lifecycle -> (structure)
                 The  lifecycle  defines  when a protected resource is transi-
                 tioned to cold storage and when it  expires.  Backup  transi-
                 tions  and  expires  backups  automatically  according to the
                 lifecycle that you define.

                 Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored  in  cold
                 storage  for  a  minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the retention
                 setting must be 90 days greater than the transition  to  cold
                 after days setting. The transition to cold after days setting
                 cannot be changed after a backup  has  been  transitioned  to
                 cold.

                 Only  resource  types that support full Backup management can
                 transition their backups  to  cold  storage.  Those  resource
                 types  are  listed in the "Full Backup management" section of
                 the Feature availability by resource  table.  Backup  ignores
                 this expression for other resource types.

                 MoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)
                     Specifies the number of days after creation that a recov-
                     ery point is moved to cold storage.

                 DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
                     Specifies the number of days after creation that a recov-
                     ery  point  is deleted. Must be greater than 90 days plus
                     MoveToColdStorageAfterDays .

              EncryptionKeyArn -> (string)
                 The server-side encryption key that is used to  protect  your
                 backups;                     for                     example,
                 arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
                 .

              IsEncrypted -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean value that is returned as TRUE if the specified re-
                 covery point is encrypted, or FALSE if the recovery point  is
                 not encrypted.

              LastRestoreTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time a recovery point was last restored, in Unix
                 format and Coordinated Universal Time  (UTC).  The  value  of
                 LastRestoreTime is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the
                 value 1516925490.087  represents  Friday,  January  26,  2018
                 12:11:30.087 AM.
