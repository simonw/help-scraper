SYNOPSIS
            update-backup-plan
          --backup-plan-id <value>
          --backup-plan <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --backup-plan-id (string)
          Uniquely identifies a backup plan.

       --backup-plan (structure)
          Specifies  the  body of a backup plan. Includes a BackupPlanName and
          one or more sets of Rules .

          BackupPlanName -> (string)
              The display name of a backup plan. Must contain 1 to 50 alphanu-
              meric or '-_.' characters.

          Rules -> (list)
              An array of BackupRule objects, each of which specifies a sched-
              uled task that is used to back up a selection of resources.

              (structure)
                 Specifies a scheduled task used to back up a selection of re-
                 sources.

                 RuleName -> (string)
                     A  display  name  for a backup rule. Must contain 1 to 50
                     alphanumeric or '-_.' characters.

                 TargetBackupVaultName -> (string)
                     The name of a logical container where backups are stored.
                     Backup  vaults are identified by names that are unique to
                     the account used to create them and the Amazon  Web  Ser-
                     vices Region where they are created. They consist of low-
                     ercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

                 ScheduleExpression -> (string)
                     A CRON expression in UTC specifying when Backup initiates
                     a backup job.

                 StartWindowMinutes -> (long)
                     A  value  in minutes after a backup is scheduled before a
                     job will be canceled if it  doesn't  start  successfully.
                     This value is optional.

                 CompletionWindowMinutes -> (long)
                     A  value  in  minutes  after a backup job is successfully
                     started before it must be completed or it  will  be  can-
                     celed by Backup. This value is optional.

                 Lifecycle -> (structure)
                     The  lifecycle defines when a protected resource is tran-
                     sitioned to cold storage and when it expires. Backup will
                     transition  and expire backups automatically according to
                     the lifecycle that you define.

                     Backups transitioned to cold storage must  be  stored  in
                     cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the re-
                     tention setting must be 90 days greater than the  transi-
                     tion  to  cold after days setting. The transition to cold
                     after days setting cannot be changed after a  backup  has
                     been transitioned to cold.

                     Resource  types  that are able to be transitioned to cold
                     storage are listed in the  "Lifecycle  to  cold  storage"
                     section  of  the  Feature availability by resource table.
                     Backup ignores this expression for other resource types.

                     MoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)
                        Specifies the number of days after creation that a re-
                        covery point is moved to cold storage.

                     DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
                        Specifies the number of days after creation that a re-
                        covery point is deleted. Must be greater than 90  days
                        plus MoveToColdStorageAfterDays .

                 RecoveryPointTags -> (map)
                     To  help organize your resources, you can assign your own
                     metadata to the resources that you create. Each tag is  a
                     key-value pair.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 CopyActions -> (list)
                     An  array  of  CopyAction objects, which contains the de-
                     tails of the copy operation.

                     (structure)
                        The details of the copy operation.

                        Lifecycle -> (structure)
                            Contains an array of Transition objects specifying
                            how  long  in days before a recovery point transi-
                            tions to cold storage or is deleted.

                            Backups  transitioned  to  cold  storage  must  be
                            stored  in  cold storage for a minimum of 90 days.
                            Therefore, on the console, the  retention  setting
                            must  be  90  days  greater than the transition to
                            cold after days setting. The  transition  to  cold
                            after  days  setting  cannot  be  changed  after a
                            backup has been transitioned to cold.

                            Resource types that are able to be transitioned to
                            cold  storage are listed in the "Lifecycle to cold
                            storage" section of the  Feature  availability  by
                            resource table. Backup ignores this expression for
                            other resource types.

                            MoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)
                               Specifies the number  of  days  after  creation
                               that a recovery point is moved to cold storage.

                            DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
                               Specifies  the  number  of  days after creation
                               that a  recovery  point  is  deleted.  Must  be
                               greater  than 90 days plus MoveToColdStorageAf-
                               terDays .

                        DestinationBackupVaultArn -> (string)
                            An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely  iden-
                            tifies the destination backup vault for the copied
                            backup.                For                example,
                            arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:vault:aBack-
                            upVault .

                 EnableContinuousBackup -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether Backup creates continuous backups. True
                     causes  Backup  to  create  continuous backups capable of
                     point-in-time restore (PITR). False  (or  not  specified)
                     causes Backup to create snapshot backups.

          AdvancedBackupSettings -> (list)
              Specifies  a list of BackupOptions for each resource type. These
              settings are only available for Windows Volume Shadow Copy  Ser-
              vice (VSS) backup jobs.

              (structure)
                 A list of backup options for each resource type.

                 ResourceType -> (string)
                     Specifies  an  object containing resource type and backup
                     options. The only supported resource type is  Amazon  EC2
                     instances  with Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS).
                     For a CloudFormation example, see the sample  CloudForma-
                     tion  template  to  enable Windows VSS in the Backup User
                     Guide .

                     Valid values: EC2 .

                 BackupOptions -> (map)
                     Specifies the backup option for a selected resource. This
                     option is only available for Windows VSS backup jobs.

                     Valid values:

                     Set  to  "WindowsVSS":"enabled"  to enable the WindowsVSS
                     backup option and create a Windows VSS backup.

                     Set  to  "WindowsVSS":"disabled"  to  create  a   regular
                     backup. The WindowsVSS option is not enabled by default.

                     If  you  specify an invalid option, you get an InvalidPa-
                     rameterValueException exception.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
