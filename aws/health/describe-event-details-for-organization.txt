NAME
       describe-event-details-for-organization -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns detailed information about one or more specified events for one
       or more Amazon Web Services accounts in your organization. This  infor-
       mation  includes  standard  event data (such as the Amazon Web Services
       Region and service), an event description, and (depending on the event)
       possible  metadata.  This  operation  doesn't return affected entities,
       such as the resources related to the event. To  return  affected  enti-
       ties, use the DescribeAffectedEntitiesForOrganization operation.

       NOTE:
          Before  you can call this operation, you must first enable Health to
          work    with    Organizations.    To    do    this,     call     the
          EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization operation from your organi-
          zation's management account.

       When you call the DescribeEventDetailsForOrganization operation,  spec-
       ify the organizationEventDetailFilters object in the request. Depending
       on the Health event type, note the following differences:

       o To return event details for a public event, you must specify  a  null
         value  for  the  awsAccountId parameter. If you specify an account ID
         for a public event, Health returns an error  message  because  public
         events aren't specific to an account.

       o To  return  event details for an event that is specific to an account
         in your organization, you must specify the awsAccountId parameter  in
         the  request.  If  you don't specify an account ID, Health returns an
         error message because the event is specific to an account in your or-
         ganization.

       For more information, see Event .

       NOTE:
          This operation doesn't support resource-level permissions. You can't
          use this operation to  allow  or  deny  access  to  specific  Health
          events.  For more information, see Resource- and action-based condi-
          tions in the Health User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            describe-event-details-for-organization
          --organization-event-detail-filters <value>
          [--locale <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-event-detail-filters (list)
          A set of JSON elements that includes the awsAccountId and the  even-
          tArn .

          (structure)
              The     values    used    to    filter    results    from    the
              DescribeEventDetailsForOrganization                          and
              DescribeAffectedEntitiesForOrganization operations.

              eventArn -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the event. The event ARN has the
                 ``
                 arn:aws:health:event-region  ::event/SERVICE /EVENT_TYPE_CODE
                 /EVENT_TYPE_PLUS_ID `` format.

                 For example, an event ARN might look like the following:
                     arn:aws:health:us-east-1::event/EC2/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIRE-
                     MENT_SCHEDULED/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHED-
                     ULED_ABC123-DEF456

              awsAccountId -> (string)
                 The 12-digit Amazon Web Services account  numbers  that  con-
                 tains the affected entities.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          eventArn=string,awsAccountId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "eventArn": "string",
              "awsAccountId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --locale (string)
          The  locale (language) to return information in. English (en) is the
          default and the only supported value at this time.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       successfulSet -> (list)
          Information about the events that could be retrieved.

          (structure)
              Detailed information about an event. A combination of  an  Event
              object,  an  EventDescription  object,  and  additional metadata
              about       the       event.       Returned        by        the
              DescribeEventDetailsForOrganization operation.

              awsAccountId -> (string)
                 The  12-digit  Amazon  Web Services account numbers that con-
                 tains the affected entities.

              event -> (structure)
                 Summary information about an Health event.

                 Health events can be public or account-specific:

                 o Public events might be service events that are not specific
                   to an Amazon Web Services account. For example, if there is
                   an issue with an Amazon Web Services  Region,  Health  pro-
                   vides  information  about  the event, even if you don't use
                   services or resources in that Region.

                 o Account-specific events are specific to either your  Amazon
                   Web  Services  account  or an account in your organization.
                   For example, if there's an issue with Amazon  Elastic  Com-
                   pute Cloud in a Region that you use, Health provides infor-
                   mation about the event and the affected  resources  in  the
                   account.

                 You  can  determine if an event is public or account-specific
                 by using the eventScopeCode parameter. For more  information,
                 see eventScopeCode .

                 arn -> (string)
                     The  unique  identifier  for the event. The event ARN has
                     the
                     ``
                     arn:aws:health:event-region               ::event/SERVICE
                     /EVENT_TYPE_CODE /EVENT_TYPE_PLUS_ID `` format.

                     For example, an event ARN might look like the following:
                        arn:aws:health:us-east-1::event/EC2/EC2_INSTANCE_RE-
                        TIREMENT_SCHEDULED/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHED-
                        ULED_ABC123-DEF456

                 service -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Web Services service that is affected by the
                     event. For example, EC2 , RDS .

                 eventTypeCode -> (string)
                     The unique identifier for the event type. The  format  is
                     AWS_*SERVICE*    _*DESCRIPTION*   ``   ;   for   example,
                     ``AWS_EC2_SYSTEM_MAINTENANCE_EVENT .

                 eventTypeCategory -> (string)
                     A list of event type category codes. Possible values  are
                     issue  ,  accountNotification , or scheduledChange . Cur-
                     rently, the investigation value isn't supported  at  this
                     time.

                 region -> (string)
                     The Amazon Web Services Region name of the event.

                 availabilityZone -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Web Services Availability Zone of the event.
                     For example, us-east-1a.

                 startTime -> (timestamp)
                     The date and time that the event began.

                 endTime -> (timestamp)
                     The date and time that the event ended.

                 lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                     The most recent date and time that the event was updated.

                 statusCode -> (string)
                     The most recent status of the event. Possible values  are
                     open , closed , and upcoming .

                 eventScopeCode -> (string)
                     This  parameter specifies if the Health event is a public
                     Amazon Web Services service event or an  account-specific
                     event.

                     o If  the  eventScopeCode  value is PUBLIC , then the af-
                       fectedAccounts value is always empty.

                     o If the eventScopeCode value is ACCOUNT_SPECIFIC ,  then
                       the  affectedAccounts  value  lists the affected Amazon
                       Web Services accounts in your organization.  For  exam-
                       ple, if an event affects a service such as Amazon Elas-
                       tic Compute Cloud and you have Amazon Web Services  ac-
                       counts  that use that service, those account IDs appear
                       in the response.

                     o If the eventScopeCode value is NONE , then the eventArn
                       that you specified in the request is invalid or doesn't
                       exist.

              eventDescription -> (structure)
                 The detailed description of the event. Included in the infor-
                 mation returned by the DescribeEventDetails operation.

                 latestDescription -> (string)
                     The most recent description of the event.

              eventMetadata -> (map)
                 Additional metadata about the event.

                 value -> (string)

       failedSet -> (list)
          Error messages for any events that could not be retrieved.

          (structure)
              Error         information         returned         when        a
              DescribeEventDetailsForOrganization operation can't find a spec-
              ified event.

              awsAccountId -> (string)
                 Error        information        returned        when        a
                 DescribeEventDetailsForOrganization operation  can't  find  a
                 specified event.

              eventArn -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the event. The event ARN has the
                 ``
                 arn:aws:health:event-region  ::event/SERVICE /EVENT_TYPE_CODE
                 /EVENT_TYPE_PLUS_ID `` format.

                 For example, an event ARN might look like the following:
                     arn:aws:health:us-east-1::event/EC2/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIRE-
                     MENT_SCHEDULED/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHED-
                     ULED_ABC123-DEF456

              errorMessage -> (string)
                 A message that describes the error.

                 If you call the DescribeEventDetailsForOrganization operation
                 and receive one of the following errors, follow the recommen-
                 dations in the message:

                 o We couldn't find a public event that matches your  request.
                   To  find  an event that is account specific, you must enter
                   an Amazon Web Services account ID in the request.

                 o We couldn't find an account specific event for  the  speci-
                   fied  Amazon Web Services account. To find an event that is
                   public, you must enter a null value for the Amazon Web Ser-
                   vices account ID in the request.

                 o Your Amazon Web Services account doesn't include the Amazon
                   Web Services Support plan required to use the  Health  API.
