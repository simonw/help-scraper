DESCRIBE-EVENTS-FOR-ORGANIZATION()          DESCRIBE-EVENTS-FOR-ORGANIZATION()



NAME
       describe-events-for-organization -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about events across your organization in Organiza-
       tions. You can use the``filters`` parameter to specify the events  that
       you want to return. Events are returned in a summary form and don't in-
       clude the affected accounts, detailed description, any additional meta-
       data  that depends on the event type, or any affected resources. To re-
       trieve that information, use the following operations:

       o DescribeAffectedAccountsForOrganization

       o DescribeEventDetailsForOrganization

       o DescribeAffectedEntitiesForOrganization

       If you don't specify a filter , the DescribeEventsForOrganizations  re-
       turns  all events across your organization. Results are sorted by last-
       ModifiedTime , starting with the most recent event.

       For more information about the different types of  Health  events,  see
       Event .

       Before  you  can  call  this operation, you must first enable Health to
       work    with    Organizations.     To     do     this,     call     the
       EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization  operation from your organiza-
       tion's management account.

       NOTE:
          This API operation uses pagination. Specify the nextToken  parameter
          in the next request to return more results.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-events-for-organization is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: events

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "eventTypeCodes": ["string", ...],
            "awsAccountIds": ["string", ...],
            "services": ["string", ...],
            "regions": ["string", ...],
            "startTime": {
              "from": timestamp,
              "to": timestamp
            },
            "endTime": {
              "from": timestamp,
              "to": timestamp
            },
            "lastUpdatedTime": {
              "from": timestamp,

            "eventStatusCodes": ["open"|"closed"|"upcoming", ...]
          }

       --locale (string)
          The  locale (language) to return information in. English (en) is the
          default and the only supported value at this time.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       events -> (list)
          The events that match the specified filter criteria.

          (structure)
              Summary  information   about   an   event,   returned   by   the
              DescribeEventsForOrganization operation.

              arn -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the event. The event ARN has the
                 ``
                 arn:aws:health:event-region  ::event/SERVICE /EVENT_TYPE_CODE
                 /EVENT_TYPE_PLUS_ID `` format.

                 System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 420)
                        Inline literal start-string without end-string.

                        For example, an event ARN might look like the  follow-
                        ing:
                     arn:aws:health:us-east-1::event/EC2/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIRE-
                     MENT_SCHEDULED/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHED-
                     ULED_ABC123-DEF456

              service -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web  Services  service  that  is affected by the
                 event, such as EC2 and RDS.

              eventTypeCode -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for  the  event  type.  The  format  is
                 AWS_SERVICE_DESCRIPTION . For example, AWS_EC2_SYSTEM_MAINTE-
                 NANCE_EVENT .

              eventTypeCategory -> (string)
                 A list of event type category codes. Possible values are  is-
                 sue  ,  accountNotification , or scheduledChange . Currently,
                 the investigation value isn't supported at this time.

              eventScopeCode -> (string)
                 This parameter specifies if the Health event is a public Ama-
                 zon Web Services service event or an account-specific event.

                 o If  the  eventScopeCode  value  is  PUBLIC  ,  then the af-
                   fectedAccounts value is always empty.

                 o If the eventScopeCode value is ACCOUNT_SPECIFIC , then  the
                   affectedAccounts  value  lists the affected Amazon Web Ser-
                   vices accounts in your organization.  For  example,  if  an
                   event  affects  a  service  such  as Amazon Elastic Compute
                   Cloud and you have Amazon Web Services  accounts  that  use
                   that service, those account IDs appear in the response.

                 o If  the  eventScopeCode  value  is NONE , then the eventArn
                   that you specified in the request is invalid or doesn't ex-
                   ist.

              region -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Region name of the event.

              startTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the event began.

              endTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the event ended.

              lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The most recent date and time that the event was updated.

              statusCode -> (string)
                 The most recent status of the event. Possible values are open
                 , closed , and upcoming .

       nextToken -> (string)
          If the results of a search are large, only a portion of the  results
          are  returned,  and  a nextToken pagination token is returned in the
          response. To retrieve the next batch of results, reissue the  search
          request  and  include the returned token. When all results have been
          returned, the response does not contain a pagination token value.
