DESCRIBE-EVENTS()                                            DESCRIBE-EVENTS()



NAME
       describe-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about events that meet the specified filter crite-
       ria. Events are returned in a summary form and do not include  the  de-
       tailed  description,  any additional metadata that depends on the event
       type, or any affected resources. To retrieve that information, use  the
       DescribeEventDetails and DescribeAffectedEntities operations.

       If  no  filter criteria are specified, all events are returned. Results
       are sorted by lastModifiedTime , starting with the most recent event.

       NOTE:

          o When you call the DescribeEvents operation and specify  an  entity
            for  the entityValues parameter, Health might return public events
            that aren't specific to that resource. For example,  if  you  call
            DescribeEvents  and  specify  an  ID for an Amazon Elastic Compute
            Cloud (Amazon EC2)  instance,  Health  might  return  events  that
            aren't  specific  to  that resource or service. To get events that
            are specific to a service, use the services parameter in the  fil-
            ter object. For more information, see Event .

          o This  API operation uses pagination. Specify the nextToken parame-
            ter in the next request to return more results.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-events is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: events

       --locale (string)
          The locale (language) to return information in. English (en) is  the
          default and the only supported value at this time.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 2: To list AWS Health events by service and event status code

       The  following describe-events example lists AWS Health events for Ama-
       zon Elastic Compute Cloud  (Amazon  EC2)  where  the  event  status  is
       closed.

          aws health describe-events \
              --filter "services=EC2,eventStatusCodes=closed"

OUTPUT
       events -> (list)
          The events that match the specified filter criteria.

          (structure)
              Summary information about an Health event.

              Health events can be public or account-specific:

              o Public events might be service events that are not specific to
                an  Amazon  Web  Services account. For example, if there is an
                issue with an Amazon Web Services Region, Health provides  in-
                formation  about  the event, even if you don't use services or
                resources in that Region.

              o Account-specific events are specific to either your Amazon Web
                Services account or an account in your organization. For exam-
                ple, if there's an issue with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud  in
                a  Region  that you use, Health provides information about the
                event and the affected resources in the account.

              You can determine if an event is public or  account-specific  by
              using  the  eventScopeCode  parameter. For more information, see
              eventScopeCode .

              arn -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the event. The event ARN has the
                 ``
                 arn:aws:health:event-region ::event/SERVICE  /EVENT_TYPE_CODE
                 /EVENT_TYPE_PLUS_ID `` format.

                 System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 812)
                        Inline literal start-string without end-string.

                        For  example, an event ARN might look like the follow-
                        ing:
                     arn:aws:health:us-east-1::event/EC2/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIRE-
                     MENT_SCHEDULED/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHED-
                     ULED_ABC123-DEF456

              service -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services  service  that  is  affected  by  the
                 event. For example, EC2 , RDS .

              eventTypeCode -> (string)
                 The  unique  identifier  for  the  event  type. The format is
                 AWS_*SERVICE* _*DESCRIPTION* `` ; for example, ``AWS_EC2_SYS-
                 TEM_MAINTENANCE_EVENT .

              eventTypeCategory -> (string)
                 A  list of event type category codes. Possible values are is-
                 sue , accountNotification , or scheduledChange  .  Currently,
                 the investigation value isn't supported at this time.

              region -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Region name of the event.

              availabilityZone -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web Services Availability Zone of the event. For
                 example, us-east-1a.

              startTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the event began.

              endTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the event ended.

              lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The most recent date and time that the event was updated.

              statusCode -> (string)
                 The most recent status of the event. Possible values are open
                 , closed , and upcoming .

              eventScopeCode -> (string)
                 This parameter specifies if the Health event is a public Ama-
                 zon Web Services service event or an account-specific event.

                 o If the eventScopeCode  value  is  PUBLIC  ,  then  the  af-
                   fectedAccounts value is always empty.

                 o If  the eventScopeCode value is ACCOUNT_SPECIFIC , then the
                   affectedAccounts value lists the affected Amazon  Web  Ser-
                   vices  accounts  in  your  organization. For example, if an
                   event affects a service  such  as  Amazon  Elastic  Compute
                   Cloud  and  you  have Amazon Web Services accounts that use
                   that service, those account IDs appear in the response.

                 o If the eventScopeCode value is NONE  ,  then  the  eventArn
                   that you specified in the request is invalid or doesn't ex-
                   ist.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If the results of a search are large, only a portion of the  results
          are  returned,  and  a nextToken pagination token is returned in the
          response. To retrieve the next batch of results, reissue the  search
          request  and  include the returned token. When all results have been
          returned, the response does not contain a pagination token value.
