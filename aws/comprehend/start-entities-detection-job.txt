NAME
       start-entities-detection-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  an  asynchronous entity detection job for a collection of docu-
       ments. Use the operation to track the status of a job.

       This API can be used for either standard entity detection or custom en-
       tity  recognition.  In  order to be used for custom entity recognition,
       the optional EntityRecognizerArn must be used in order to  provide  ac-
       cess to the recognizer being used to detect the custom entity.

OPTIONS
       --input-data-config (structure)
          Specifies the format and location of the input data for the job.

          S3Uri -> (string)
              The  Amazon  S3  URI for the input data. The URI must be in same
              Region as the API endpoint that you are  calling.  The  URI  can
              point  to a single input file or it can provide the prefix for a
              collection of data files.

              For example, if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix , if  the
              prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file as in-
              put. If more than one file begins with the prefix,  Amazon  Com-
              prehend uses all of them as input.

          InputFormat -> (string)
              Specifies how the text in an input file should be processed:

              o ONE_DOC_PER_FILE  -  Each  file is considered a separate docu-
                ment. Use this option when you are processing large documents,
                such as newspaper articles or scientific papers.

              o ONE_DOC_PER_LINE  -  Each line in a file is considered a sepa-
                rate document. Use this option when you  are  processing  many
                short documents, such as text messages.

          DocumentReaderConfig -> (structure)
              Provides  configuration  parameters  to override the default ac-
              tions for extracting text from PDF documents and image files.

              DocumentReadAction -> (string)
                 This field defines the Amazon  Textract  API  operation  that
                 Amazon Comprehend uses to extract text from PDF files and im-
                 age files. Enter one of the following values:

                 o TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT - The Amazon Comprehend  ser-
                   vice uses the DetectDocumentText API operation.

                 o TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT  -  The Amazon Comprehend service
                   uses the AnalyzeDocument API operation.

              DocumentReadMode -> (string)
                 Determines the text extraction actions for PDF  files.  Enter
                 one of the following values:

                 o SERVICE_DEFAULT  -  use  the  Amazon Comprehend service de-
                   faults for PDF files.

                 o FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION -  Amazon  Comprehend  uses  the
                   Textract  API  specified  by DocumentReadAction for all PDF
                   files, including digital PDF files.

              FeatureTypes -> (list)
                 Specifies the type of Amazon Textract features to  apply.  If
                 you  chose  TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT as the read action, you
                 must specify one or both of the following values:

                 o TABLES - Returns information about any tables that are  de-
                   tected in the input document.

                 o FORMS  -  Returns  information  and the data from any forms
                   that are detected in the input document.

                 (string)
                     Specifies the type of Amazon Textract features to  apply.
                     If  you  chose  TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT as the read ac-
                     tion, you must specify one or both of the following  val-
                     ues:

                     o TABLES  -  Returns additional information about any ta-
                       bles that are detected in the input document.

                     o FORMS - Returns additional information about any  forms
                       that are detected in the input document.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Uri=string,InputFormat=string,DocumentReaderConfig={DocumentReadAction=string,DocumentReadMode=string,FeatureTypes=[string,string]}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Uri": "string",
            "InputFormat": "ONE_DOC_PER_FILE"|"ONE_DOC_PER_LINE",
            "DocumentReaderConfig": {
              "DocumentReadAction": "TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT"|"TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT",
              "DocumentReadMode": "SERVICE_DEFAULT"|"FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION",
              "FeatureTypes": ["TABLES"|"FORMS", ...]
            }
          }

       --output-data-config (structure)
          Specifies where to send the output files.

          S3Uri -> (string)
              When you use the OutputDataConfig object with asynchronous oper-
              ations, you specify the Amazon S3 location  where  you  want  to
              write the output data. The URI must be in the same Region as the
              API endpoint that you are calling. The location is used  as  the
              prefix for the actual location of the output file.

              When the topic detection job is finished, the service creates an
              output file in a directory specific to the job. The S3Uri  field
              contains the location of the output file, called output.tar.gz .
              It is a compressed archive that contains the ouput of the opera-
              tion.

              For  a  PII entity detection job, the output file is plain text,
              not a compressed archive. The output file name is  the  same  as
              the input file, with .out appended at the end.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              ID  for the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) key
              that Amazon Comprehend uses to encrypt the output  results  from
              an  analysis  job. The KmsKeyId can be one of the following for-
              mats:

              o KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

              o Amazon    Resource    Name    (ARN)    of    a    KMS     Key:
                "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

              o KMS Key Alias: "alias/ExampleAlias"

              o ARN        of         a         KMS         Key         Alias:
                "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias"

       --language-code (string)
          The  language  of  the input documents. All documents must be in the
          same language. You can specify any of  the  languages  supported  by
          Amazon  Comprehend. If custom entities recognition is used, this pa-
          rameter is ignored and the language used for training the  model  is
          used instead.

          The VolumeKmsKeyId can be either of the following formats:

          o KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

          o Amazon     Resource     Name     (ARN)     of     a    KMS    Key:
            "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

              "sg-03b388029b0a285ea".  For  more  information,  see   Security
              Groups for your VPC .

              (string)

          Subnets -> (list)
              The ID for each subnet being used in your private VPC. This sub-
              net is a subset of the a range of IPv4 addresses used by the VPC
              and is specific to a given availability zone in the VPCs Region.
              This ID number is preceded by  "subnet-",  for  instance:  "sub-

          }

       --tags (list)
          Tags to associate with the  entities  detection  job.  A  tag  is  a
          key-value  pair that adds metadata to a resource used by Amazon Com-
          prehend. For example, a tag with "Sales" as the key might  be  added
          to a resource to indicate its use by the sales department.

          (structure)
              A  key-value  pair that adds as a metadata to a resource used by
              Amazon Comprehend. For example, a tag with  the  key-value  pair
              Department:Sales  might  be  added to a resource to indicate its
              use by a particular department.

              Key -> (string)
                 The initial part of a key-value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show
                 which resources are used by which departments, you might  use
                 Department as the key portion of the pair, with multiple pos-
                 sible values such as sales, legal, and administration.

              Value -> (string)
                 The second part of a key-value pair that forms a tag  associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show
                 which resources are used by which departments, you might  use
                 Department  as  the initial (key) portion of the pair, with a
                 value of sales to indicate the sales department.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example  1:  To  start  a  standard  entity  detection  job  using  the
       pre-trained model

       The following start-entities-detection-job example starts an  asynchro-
       nous entities detection job for all files located at the address speci-
       fied by the --input-data-config tag. The S3 bucket in this example con-
       tains  Sampletext1.txt, Sampletext2.txt, and Sampletext3.txt.  When the
       job is complete, the folder, output, is placed in the  location  speci-
       fied  by  the  --output-data-config tag. The folder contains output.txt
       which lists all of the named entities detected within each text file as
       well  as  the pre-trained model's confidence score for each prediction.
       The Json output is printed on one line per input file, but is formatted
       here for readability.

       Example 2: To start a custom entity detection job

       The following start-entities-detection-job example starts an  asynchro-
       nous custom entities detection job for all files located at the address
       specified by the --input-data-config  tag.  In  this  example,  the  S3
       bucket   in  this  example  contains  SampleFeedback1.txt,  SampleFeed-
       back2.txt, and SampleFeedback3.txt.  The entity  recognizer  model  was
       trained  on  customer support Feedbacks to recognize device names. When
       the job is complete, an the folder, output,  is  put  at  the  location
       specified  by  the  --output-data-config  tag. The folder contains out-
       put.txt, which lists all of the named  entities  detected  within  each
       text  file as well as the pre-trained model's confidence score for each
       prediction. The Json output is printed on one line  per  file,  but  is
       formatted here for readability.
