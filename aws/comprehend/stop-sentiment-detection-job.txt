STOP-SENTIMENT-DETECTION-JOB()                  STOP-SENTIMENT-DETECTION-JOB()



NAME
       stop-sentiment-detection-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops a sentiment detection job in progress.

       If  the  job state is IN_PROGRESS the job is marked for termination and
       put into the STOP_REQUESTED state. If the job completes before  it  can
       be stopped, it is put into the COMPLETED state; otherwise the job is be
       stopped and put into the STOPPED state.

       If the job is in the COMPLETED or FAILED state when you call the  Stop-
       DominantLanguageDetectionJob operation, the operation returns a 400 In-
       ternal Request Exception.

       When a job is stopped, any documents already processed are  written  to
       the output location.

SYNOPSIS
            stop-sentiment-detection-job
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The identifier of the sentiment detection job to stop.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
          The identifier of the sentiment detection job to stop.

       JobStatus -> (string)
          Either STOP_REQUESTED if the job is currently running, or STOPPED if
          the job was previously stopped  with  the  StopSentimentDetectionJob
          operation.
