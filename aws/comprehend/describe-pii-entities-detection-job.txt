NAME
       describe-pii-entities-detection-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the  properties associated with a PII entities detection job. For
       example, you can use this operation to get the job status.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-pii-entities-detection-job
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The identifier that Amazon Comprehend generated for the job. The op-
          eration returns this identifier in its response.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PiiEntitiesDetectionJobProperties -> (structure)
          Provides information about a PII entities detection job.

          JobId -> (string)
              The identifier assigned to the PII entities detection job.

          JobArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  PII  entities  detection
              job.  It is a unique, fully qualified identifier for the job. It
              includes the AWS account, Region, and the job ID. The format  of
              the ARN is as follows:
                 arn:<partition>:comprehend:<region>:<account-id>:pii-enti-
                 ties-detection-job/<job-id>

              The following is an example job ARN:
                 arn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:111122223333:pii-entities-detec-
                 tion-job/1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab

          JobName -> (string)
              The name that you assigned the PII entities detection job.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              The  current  status  of  the PII entities detection job. If the
              status is FAILED , the Message field shows the  reason  for  the
              failure.

          Message -> (string)
              A description of the status of a job.

          SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
              The  time  that the PII entities detection job was submitted for
              processing.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the PII entities detection job completed.

          InputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The input properties for a PII entities detection job.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The URI must be in same
                 region  as the API endpoint that you are calling. The URI can
                 point to a single input file or it can provide the prefix for
                 a collection of data files.

                 For  example,  if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix , if
                 the prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file
                 as  input. If more than one file begins with the prefix, Ama-
                 zon Comprehend uses all of them as input.

              InputFormat -> (string)
                 Specifies how the text in an input file should be processed:

                 o ONE_DOC_PER_FILE - Each file is considered a separate docu-
                   ment.  Use  this option when you are processing large docu-
                   ments, such as newspaper articles or scientific papers.

                 o ONE_DOC_PER_LINE - Each line in a file is considered a sep-
                   arate  document.  Use  this  option when you are processing
                   many short documents, such as text messages.

              DocumentReaderConfig -> (structure)
                 The document reader config field applies only for  InputData-
                 Config of StartEntitiesDetectionJob.

                 Use  DocumentReaderConfig to provide specifications about how
                 you want your inference documents read. Currently it  applies
                 for  PDF documents in StartEntitiesDetectionJob custom infer-
                 ence.

                 DocumentReadAction -> (string)
                     This enum field will start with two values which will ap-
                     ply to PDFs:

                     o TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT  -  The service calls De-
                       tectDocumentText for PDF documents per page.

                     o TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT - The service calls  Analyze-
                       Document for PDF documents per page.

                 DocumentReadMode -> (string)
                     This enum field provides two values:

                     o SERVICE_DEFAULT  -  use  service  defaults for Document
                       reading. For Digital PDF it would mean using an  inter-
                       nal parser instead of Textract APIs

                     o FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION  -  Always use specified ac-
                       tion for DocumentReadAction, including Digital PDF.

                 FeatureTypes -> (list)
                     Specifies how the text in an input file  should  be  pro-
                     cessed:

                     (string)
                        A list of the types of analyses to perform. This field
                        specifies what feature types need to be extracted from
                        the document where entity recognition is expected.

                        o TABLES  -  Add TABLES to the list to return informa-
                          tion about the tables that are detected in the input
                          document.

                        o FORMS - Add FORMS to return detected form data.

          OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The output data configuration that you supplied when you created
              the PII entities detection job.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 When you use the PiiOutputDataConfig object with asynchronous
                 operations, you specify the Amazon S3 location where you want
                 to write the output data.

                 For a PII entity detection job,  the  output  file  is  plain
                 text,  not  a compressed archive. The output file name is the
                 same as the input file, with .out appended at the end.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 ID for the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key  that  Amazon
                 Comprehend  uses to encrypt the output results from an analy-
                 sis job.

          RedactionConfig -> (structure)
              Provides configuration parameters for PII entity redaction.

              This parameter is required if you  set  the  Mode  parameter  to
              ONLY_REDACTION  . In that case, you must provide a RedactionCon-
              fig definition that includes the PiiEntityTypes parameter.

              PiiEntityTypes -> (list)
                 An array of the types of PII entities that Amazon  Comprehend
                 detects in the input text for your request.

                 (string)

              MaskMode -> (string)
                 Specifies  whether  the  PII entity is redacted with the mask
                 character or the entity type.

              MaskCharacter -> (string)
                 A character that replaces each character in the redacted  PII
                 entity.

          LanguageCode -> (string)
              The language code of the input documents

          DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that gives Amazon Comprehend read
              access to your input data.

          Mode -> (string)
              Specifies whether the output provides the locations (offsets) of
              PII entities or a file in which PII entities are redacted.
