       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-events-detection-jobs
          [--filter <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          Filters  the  jobs  that  are returned. You can filter jobs on their
          name, status, or the date and time that they were submitted. You can
          only set one filter at a time.

          JobName -> (string)
              Filters on the name of the events detection job.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              Filters  the list of jobs based on job status. Returns only jobs
              with the specified status.

          SubmitTimeBefore -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was sub-
              mitted  for  processing.  Returns only jobs submitted before the
              specified time. Jobs are returned in ascending order, oldest  to
              newest.

          SubmitTimeAfter -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was sub-
              mitted for processing. Returns only  jobs  submitted  after  the
              specified time. Jobs are returned in descending order, newest to
              oldest.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          JobName=string,JobStatus=string,SubmitTimeBefore=timestamp,SubmitTimeAfter=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "JobName": "string",
            "JobStatus": "SUBMITTED"|"IN_PROGRESS"|"COMPLETED"|"FAILED"|"STOP_REQUESTED"|"STOPPED",
            "SubmitTimeBefore": timestamp,
            "SubmitTimeAfter": timestamp
          }

       --next-token (string)
          Identifies the next page of results to return.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in each page.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EventsDetectionJobPropertiesList -> (list)
          A list containing the properties of each job that is returned.

          (structure)
              Provides information about an events detection job.

              JobId -> (string)
                 The identifier assigned to the events detection job.

              JobArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the events detection job.
                 It is a unique, fully qualified identifier for  the  job.  It
                 includes  the AWS account, Region, and the job ID. The format
                 of the ARN is as follows:
                     arn:<partition>:comprehend:<region>:<ac-
                     count-id>:events-detection-job/<job-id>

                 The following is an example job ARN:
                     arn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:111122223333:events-detec-
                     tion-job/1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab

              JobName -> (string)
                 The name you assigned the events detection job.

              JobStatus -> (string)
                 The current status of the events detection job.

              Message -> (string)
                 A description of the status of the events detection job.

              SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the events detection job was submitted for pro-
                 cessing.

              EndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the events detection job completed.

              InputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The  input data configuration that you supplied when you cre-
                 ated the events detection job.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The URI must be  in
                     same region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The
                     URI can point to a single input file or  it  can  provide
                     the prefix for a collection of data files.

                     For  example, if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix ,
                     if the prefix is a single file,  Amazon  Comprehend  uses
                     that file as input. If more than one file begins with the
                     prefix, Amazon Comprehend uses all of them as input.

                 InputFormat -> (string)
                     Specifies how the text in an input file  should  be  pro-
                     cessed:

                     o ONE_DOC_PER_FILE  -  Each file is considered a separate
                       document. Use this option when you are processing large
                       documents, such as newspaper articles or scientific pa-
                       pers.

                     o ONE_DOC_PER_LINE - Each line in a file is considered  a
                       separate  document.  Use  this option when you are pro-
                       cessing many short documents, such as text messages.

                 DocumentReaderConfig -> (structure)
                     The document reader config field applies only for  Input-
                     DataConfig of StartEntitiesDetectionJob.

                     Use  DocumentReaderConfig to provide specifications about
                     how you want your inference documents read. Currently  it
                     applies  for  PDF  documents in StartEntitiesDetectionJob
                     custom inference.

                     DocumentReadAction -> (string)
                        This enum field will start with two values which  will
                        apply to PDFs:

                        o TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT  -  The  service calls
                          DetectDocumentText for PDF documents per page.

                        o TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT - The service  calls  Ana-
                          lyzeDocument for PDF documents per page.

                     DocumentReadMode -> (string)
                        This enum field provides two values:

                        o SERVICE_DEFAULT  - use service defaults for Document
                          reading. For Digital PDF it would mean using an  in-
                          ternal parser instead of Textract APIs

                        o FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION  -  Always  use specified
                          action  for  DocumentReadAction,  including  Digital
                          PDF.

                     FeatureTypes -> (list)
                        Specifies how the text in an input file should be pro-
                        cessed:

                        (string)
                            A list of the types of analyses to  perform.  This
                            field  specifies what feature types need to be ex-
                            tracted from the document where entity recognition
                            is expected.

                            o TABLES - Add TABLES to the list to return infor-
                              mation about the tables that are detected in the
                              input document.

                            o FORMS - Add FORMS to return detected form data.

              OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The output data configuration that you supplied when you cre-
                 ated the events detection job.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     When you use the OutputDataConfig object  with  asynchro-
                     nous operations, you specify the Amazon S3 location where
                     you want to write the output data. The URI must be in the
                     same region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The
                     location is used as the prefix for the actual location of
                     the output file.

                     When  the  topic  detection  job is finished, the service
                     creates an output file in a  directory  specific  to  the
                     job.  The S3Uri field contains the location of the output
                     file, called output.tar.gz . It is a  compressed  archive
                     that contains the ouput of the operation.

                 KmsKeyId -> (string)
                     ID for the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key that Ama-
                     zon Comprehend uses to encrypt the output results from an
                     analysis  job.  The  KmsKeyId can be one of the following
                     formats:

                     o KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                     o Amazon   Resource   Name   (ARN)   of   a   KMS    Key:
                       "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                     o KMS Key Alias: "alias/ExampleAlias"

                     o ARN       of       a       KMS        Key        Alias:
                       "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias"

              LanguageCode -> (string)

                 Management (IAM) role that grants Amazon Comprehend read  ac-
                 cess to your input data.

              TargetEventTypes -> (list)
                 The types of events that are detected by the job.
