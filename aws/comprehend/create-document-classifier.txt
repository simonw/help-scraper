CREATE-DOCUMENT-CLASSIFIER()                      CREATE-DOCUMENT-CLASSIFIER()



NAME
       create-document-classifier -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new document classifier that you can use to categorize docu-
       ments. To create a classifier, you provide a set of training  documents
       that  labeled with the categories that you want to use. After the clas-
       sifier is trained you can use it to categorize a set of  labeled  docu-
       ments  into  the  categories.  For  more  information,  see   how-docu-
       ment-classification .

OPTIONS
       --document-classifier-name (string)
          The name of the document classifier.

       --version-name (string)
          The version name given to  the  newly  created  classifier.  Version
          names can have a maximum of 256 characters. Alphanumeric characters,
          hyphens (-) and underscores (_) are allowed. The version  name  must
          be  unique among all models with the same classifier name in the ac-
          count/AWS Region.

       --data-access-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS  Identity  and  Management
          (IAM)  role  that grants Amazon Comprehend read access to your input
          data.

       --tags (list)
          Tags to be associated with the document classifier being created.  A
          tag  is  a key-value pair that adds as a metadata to a resource used
          by Amazon Comprehend. For example, a tag with  "Sales"  as  the  key
          might  be  added  to a resource to indicate its use by the sales de-
          partment.

          (structure)
              A key-value pair that adds as a metadata to a resource  used  by
              Amazon  Comprehend.  For  example, a tag with the key-value pair
              Department:Sales might be added to a resource  to  indicate  its
              use by a particular department.

              Key -> (string)
                 The initial part of a key-value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show
                 which  resources are used by which departments, you might use
                 Department as the key portion of the pair, with multiple pos-
                 sible values such as sales, legal, and administration.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  second part of a key-value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show
                 which  resources are used by which departments, you might use
                 Department as the initial (key) portion of the pair,  with  a
                 value of sales to indicate the sales department.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --input-data-config (structure)
          Specifies the format and location of the input data for the job.

          DataFormat -> (string)
              The format of your training data:

              o COMPREHEND_CSV  : A two-column CSV file, where labels are pro-
                vided in the first column, and documents are provided  in  the
                second.  If you use this value, you must provide the S3Uri pa-
                rameter in your request.

              o AUGMENTED_MANIFEST : A labeled dataset  that  is  produced  by
                Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. This file is in JSON lines for-
                mat. Each line is a  complete  JSON  object  that  contains  a
                training  document and its associated labels.  If you use this
                value, you must provide the  AugmentedManifests  parameter  in
                your request.

              If  you  don't  specify  a value, Amazon Comprehend uses COMPRE-
              HEND_CSV as the default.

          S3Uri -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The S3 bucket must  be  in
              the  same  region  as the API endpoint that you are calling. The
              URI can point to a single input file or it can provide the  pre-
              fix for a collection of input files.

              For  example, if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix , if the
              prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file as in-
              put.  If  more than one file begins with the prefix, Amazon Com-
              prehend uses all of them as input.

              This parameter is required if  you  set  DataFormat  to  COMPRE-
              HEND_CSV .

          TestS3Uri -> (string)
              The  Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The Amazon S3 bucket must
              be in the same AWS Region as the API endpoint that you are call-
              ing.  The URI can point to a single input file or it can provide
              the prefix for a collection of input files.

          LabelDelimiter -> (string)
              Indicates the delimiter used to separate each label for training
              a  multi-label  classifier. The default delimiter between labels
              is a pipe (|). You can use a different character as a  delimiter
              (if  it's an allowed character) by specifying it under Delimiter
              for labels. If the training documents use a delimiter other than
              the  default  or  the  delimiter you specify, the labels on that
              line will be combined to make a single unique label, such as LA-
              BELLABELLABEL.

          AugmentedManifests -> (list)
              A  list  of  augmented manifest files that provide training data
              for your custom model. An augmented manifest file is  a  labeled
              dataset that is produced by Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth.

              This  parameter  is  required  if  you  set  DataFormat  to AUG-
              MENTED_MANIFEST .

              (structure)
                 An augmented manifest file that provides  training  data  for
                 your  custom  model.  An augmented manifest file is a labeled
                 dataset that is produced by Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     The Amazon S3 location of the augmented manifest file.

                 Split -> (string)
                     The purpose of the data you've provided in the  augmented
                     manifest.  You can either train or test this data. If you
                     don't specify, the default is train.

                     TRAIN - all of the documents in the manifest will be used
                     for  training.  If no test documents are provided, Amazon
                     Comprehend will automatically reserve a  portion  of  the
                     training documents for testing.

                     TEST  - all of the documents in the manifest will be used
                     for testing.

                 AttributeNames -> (list)
                     The JSON attribute that contains the annotations for your
                     training  documents.  The  number of attribute names that
                     you specify depends on whether  your  augmented  manifest
                     file  is the output of a single labeling job or a chained
                     labeling job.

                     If your file is the output  of  a  single  labeling  job,
                     specify the LabelAttributeName key that was used when the
                     job was created in Ground Truth.

                     If your file is the output of  a  chained  labeling  job,
                     specify  the  LabelAttributeName key for one or more jobs
                     in the chain. Each LabelAttributeName  key  provides  the
                     annotations from an individual job.

                     (string)

                 AnnotationDataS3Uri -> (string)
                     The  S3  prefix to the annotation files that are referred
                     in the augmented manifest file.

                 SourceDocumentsS3Uri -> (string)
                     The S3 prefix to the source files  (PDFs)  that  are  re-
                     ferred to in the augmented manifest file.

                 DocumentType -> (string)
                     The  type  of  augmented  manifest.  PlainTextDocument or
                     SemiStructuredDocument. If you don't specify, the default
                     is PlainTextDocument.

                     o PLAIN_TEXT_DOCUMENT A document type that represents any
                       unicode text that is encoded in UTF-8.

                     o SEMI_STRUCTURED_DOCUMENT A  document  type  with  posi-
                       tional and structural context, like a PDF. For training
                       with Amazon Comprehend, only PDFs  are  supported.  For
                       inference,  Amazon  Comprehend  support  PDFs, DOCX and
                       TXT.

          }

       --output-data-config (structure)
          Enables the addition of output results configuration parameters  for
          custom classifier jobs.

          S3Uri -> (string)
              When you use the OutputDataConfig object while creating a custom
              classifier, you specify the Amazon S3 location where you want to
              write  the  confusion matrix. The URI must be in the same region
              as the API endpoint that you are calling. The location  is  used
              as the prefix for the actual location of this output file.

              When  the custom classifier job is finished, the service creates
              the output file in a directory specific to the  job.  The  S3Uri
              field  contains  the  location  of  the output file, called out-
              put.tar.gz . It is a compressed archive that contains the confu-
              sion matrix.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              ID for the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key that Amazon Com-
              prehend uses to encrypt the output results from an analysis job.
              The KmsKeyId can be one of the following formats:

              o KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

          }

       --mode (string)
          Indicates the mode in which the  classifier  will  be  trained.  The
          classifier  can be trained in multi-class mode, which identifies one
          and only one class for each document,  or  multi-label  mode,  which
          identifies  one  or  more  labels  for each document. In multi-label
          mode, multiple labels for an individual document are separated by  a
          delimiter. The default delimiter between labels is a pipe (|).

          Possible values:

          o MULTI_CLASS

          o MULTI_LABEL

       --model-kms-key-id (string)

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DocumentClassifierArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the document classi-
          fier.
