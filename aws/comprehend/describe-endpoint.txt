DESCRIBE-ENDPOINT()                                        DESCRIBE-ENDPOINT()



NAME
       describe-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the properties associated with a specific endpoint. Use this oper-
       ation to get the status of an endpoint.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-endpoint
          --endpoint-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --endpoint-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the endpoint being described.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EndpointProperties -> (structure)
          Describes information associated with the specific endpoint.

          EndpointArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the endpoint.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies  the  status of the endpoint. Because the endpoint up-
              dates and creation are asynchronous, so customers will  need  to
              wait for the endpoint to be Ready status before making inference
              requests.

          Message -> (string)
              Specifies a reason for failure in cases of Failed status.

          ModelArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the model to which the  end-
              point is attached.

          DesiredModelArn -> (string)
              ARN  of  the new model to use for updating an existing endpoint.
              This ARN is going to be different from the model  ARN  when  the
              update is in progress

          DesiredInferenceUnits -> (integer)
              The  desired  number  of inference units to be used by the model
              using  this  endpoint.  Each  inference  unit  represents  of  a
              throughput of 100 characters per second.

          CurrentInferenceUnits -> (integer)
              The  number of inference units currently used by the model using
              this endpoint.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The creation date and time of the endpoint.

          LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the endpoint was last modified.

          DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS  identity  and  Access
              Management  (IAM) role that grants Amazon Comprehend read access
              to trained custom models encrypted with a customer  managed  key
              (ModelKmsKeyId).

          DesiredDataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              Data  access  role ARN to use in case the new model is encrypted
              with a customer KMS key.
