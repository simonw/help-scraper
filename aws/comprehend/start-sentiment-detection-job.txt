OPTIONS
       --input-data-config (structure)
          Specifies the format and location of the input data for the job.

          S3Uri -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The URI must  be  in  same
              Region  as  the  API  endpoint that you are calling. The URI can
              point to a single input file or it can provide the prefix for  a
              collection of data files.

              For  example, if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix , if the
              prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file as in-
              put.  If  more than one file begins with the prefix, Amazon Com-
              prehend uses all of them as input.

          InputFormat -> (string)
              Specifies how the text in an input file should be processed:

              o ONE_DOC_PER_FILE - Each file is considered  a  separate  docu-
                ment. Use this option when you are processing large documents,
                such as newspaper articles or scientific papers.

              o ONE_DOC_PER_LINE - Each line in a file is considered  a  sepa-
                rate  document.  Use  this option when you are processing many
                short documents, such as text messages.

          DocumentReaderConfig -> (structure)
              Provides configuration parameters to override  the  default  ac-
              tions for extracting text from PDF documents and image files.

              DocumentReadAction -> (string)
                 This  field  defines  the  Amazon Textract API operation that
                 Amazon Comprehend uses to extract text from PDF files and im-
                 age files. Enter one of the following values:

                 o TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT  - The Amazon Comprehend ser-
                   vice uses the DetectDocumentText API operation.

                 o TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT - The Amazon  Comprehend  service
                   uses the AnalyzeDocument API operation.

              DocumentReadMode -> (string)
                 Determines  the  text extraction actions for PDF files. Enter
                 one of the following values:

                 o SERVICE_DEFAULT - use the  Amazon  Comprehend  service  de-
                   faults for PDF files.

                 o FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION  -  Amazon  Comprehend  uses the
                   Textract API specified by DocumentReadAction  for  all  PDF
                   files, including digital PDF files.

              FeatureTypes -> (list)
                 Specifies  the  type of Amazon Textract features to apply. If
                 you chose TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT as the read  action,  you
                 must specify one or both of the following values:

                 o TABLES  - Returns information about any tables that are de-
                   tected in the input document.

                 o FORMS - Returns information and the  data  from  any  forms
                   that are detected in the input document.

                 (string)
                     Specifies  the type of Amazon Textract features to apply.
                     If you chose TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT as  the  read  ac-
                     tion,  you must specify one or both of the following val-
                     ues:

                     o TABLES - Returns additional information about  any  ta-
                       bles that are detected in the input document.

                     o FORMS  - Returns additional information about any forms
                       that are detected in the input document.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Uri=string,InputFormat=string,DocumentReaderConfig={DocumentReadAction=string,DocumentReadMode=string,FeatureTypes=[string,string]}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Uri": "string",
            "InputFormat": "ONE_DOC_PER_FILE"|"ONE_DOC_PER_LINE",
            "DocumentReaderConfig": {
              "DocumentReadAction": "TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT"|"TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT",
              "DocumentReadMode": "SERVICE_DEFAULT"|"FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION",
              "FeatureTypes": ["TABLES"|"FORMS", ...]
            }
          }

       --output-data-config (structure)
          Specifies where to send the output files.

          S3Uri -> (string)
              When you use the OutputDataConfig object with asynchronous oper-
              ations,  you  specify  the  Amazon S3 location where you want to
              write the output data. The URI must be in the same Region as the
              API  endpoint  that you are calling. The location is used as the
              prefix for the actual location of the output file.

              When the topic detection job is finished, the service creates an
              output  file in a directory specific to the job. The S3Uri field
              contains the location of the output file, called output.tar.gz .
              It is a compressed archive that contains the ouput of the opera-
              tion.

              For a PII entity detection job, the output file is  plain  text,
              not  a  compressed  archive. The output file name is the same as
              the input file, with .out appended at the end.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              ID for the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS)  key
              that  Amazon  Comprehend uses to encrypt the output results from
              an analysis job. The KmsKeyId can be one of the  following  for-
              mats:

              o KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

              o Amazon     Resource    Name    (ARN)    of    a    KMS    Key:
                "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

              o KMS Key Alias: "alias/ExampleAlias"

              o ARN         of         a         KMS         Key        Alias:
                "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias"

          }

       --tags (list)
          Tags  to  associate  with  the  sentiment  detection job. A tag is a
          key-value pair that adds metadata to a resource used by Amazon  Com-
          prehend.  For  example, a tag with "Sales" as the key might be added
          to a resource to indicate its use by the sales department.

          (structure)
              A key-value pair that adds as a metadata to a resource  used  by
              Amazon  Comprehend.  For  example, a tag with the key-value pair
              Department:Sales might be added to a resource  to  indicate  its
              use by a particular department.

              Key -> (string)
                 The initial part of a key-value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show
                 which  resources are used by which departments, you might use
                 Department as the key portion of the pair, with multiple pos-
                 sible values such as sales, legal, and administration.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  second part of a key-value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show
                 which  resources are used by which departments, you might use
                 Department as the initial (key) portion of the pair,  with  a
                 value of sales to indicate the sales department.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To start an asynchronous sentiment analysis job

       The following start-sentiment-detection-job example starts an asynchro-
       nous sentiment analysis detection job for all files located at the  ad-
       dress  specified  by the --input-data-config tag.  The S3 bucket folder
       in  this  example   contains   SampleMovieReview1.txt,   SampleMovieRe-
       view2.txt,  and  SampleMovieReview3.txt.  When the job is complete, the
       folder, output, is placed at  the  location  specified  by  the  --out-
       put-data-config  tag.  The  folder contains the file, output.txt, which
       contains  the  prevailing  sentiments  for  each  text  file  and   the
       pre-trained  model's  confidence  score  for each prediction.  The Json
       output is printed on one line per file, but is formatted here for read-
       ability.
