OPTIONS
       --input-data-config (structure)
          Specifies the format and location of the input data for the job.

          S3Uri -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The URI must  be  in  same
              Region  as  the  API  endpoint that you are calling. The URI can
              point to a single input file or it can provide the prefix for  a
              collection of data files.

              For  example, if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix , if the
              prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file as in-
              put.  If  more than one file begins with the prefix, Amazon Com-
              prehend uses all of them as input.

          InputFormat -> (string)
              Specifies how the text in an input file should be processed:

              o ONE_DOC_PER_FILE - Each file is considered  a  separate  docu-
                ment. Use this option when you are processing large documents,
                such as newspaper articles or scientific papers.

              o ONE_DOC_PER_LINE - Each line in a file is considered  a  sepa-
                rate  document.  Use  this option when you are processing many
                short documents, such as text messages.

          DocumentReaderConfig -> (structure)
              Provides configuration parameters to override  the  default  ac-
              tions for extracting text from PDF documents and image files.

              DocumentReadAction -> (string)
                 This  field  defines  the  Amazon Textract API operation that
                 Amazon Comprehend uses to extract text from PDF files and im-
                 age files. Enter one of the following values:

                 o TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT  - The Amazon Comprehend ser-
                   vice uses the DetectDocumentText API operation.

                 o TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT - The Amazon  Comprehend  service
                   uses the AnalyzeDocument API operation.

              DocumentReadMode -> (string)
                 Determines  the  text extraction actions for PDF files. Enter
                 one of the following values:

                 o SERVICE_DEFAULT - use the  Amazon  Comprehend  service  de-
                   faults for PDF files.

                 o FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION  -  Amazon  Comprehend  uses the
                   Textract API specified by DocumentReadAction  for  all  PDF
                   files, including digital PDF files.

              FeatureTypes -> (list)
                 Specifies  the  type of Amazon Textract features to apply. If
                 you chose TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT as the read  action,  you
                 must specify one or both of the following values:

                 o TABLES  - Returns information about any tables that are de-
                   tected in the input document.

                 o FORMS - Returns information and the  data  from  any  forms
                   that are detected in the input document.

                 (string)
                     Specifies  the type of Amazon Textract features to apply.
                     If you chose TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT as  the  read  ac-
                     tion,  you must specify one or both of the following val-
                     ues:

                     o TABLES - Returns additional information about  any  ta-
                       bles that are detected in the input document.

                     o FORMS  - Returns additional information about any forms
                       that are detected in the input document.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Uri=string,InputFormat=string,DocumentReaderConfig={DocumentReadAction=string,DocumentReadMode=string,FeatureTypes=[string,string]}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Uri": "string",
            "InputFormat": "ONE_DOC_PER_FILE"|"ONE_DOC_PER_LINE",
            "DocumentReaderConfig": {
              "DocumentReadAction": "TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT"|"TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT",
              "DocumentReadMode": "SERVICE_DEFAULT"|"FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION",
              "FeatureTypes": ["TABLES"|"FORMS", ...]
            }
          }

       --output-data-config (structure)
          Specifies where to send the output files.

          S3Uri -> (string)
              When you use the OutputDataConfig object with asynchronous oper-
              ations,  you  specify  the  Amazon S3 location where you want to
              write the output data. The URI must be in the same Region as the
              API  endpoint  that you are calling. The location is used as the
              prefix for the actual location of the output file.

              When the topic detection job is finished, the service creates an
              output  file in a directory specific to the job. The S3Uri field
              contains the location of the output file, called output.tar.gz .
              It is a compressed archive that contains the ouput of the opera-
              tion.

              For a PII entity detection job, the output file is  plain  text,
              not  a  compressed  archive. The output file name is the same as
              the input file, with .out appended at the end.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              ID for the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS)  key
              that  Amazon  Comprehend uses to encrypt the output results from
              an analysis job. The KmsKeyId can be one of the  following  for-
              mats:

              o KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

              o Amazon     Resource    Name    (ARN)    of    a    KMS    Key:
                "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

              o KMS Key Alias: "alias/ExampleAlias"

              o ARN         of         a         KMS         Key        Alias:
                "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias"

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Uri=string,KmsKeyId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Uri": "string",

          }

       --data-access-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role  that  grants  Amazon
          Comprehend read access to your input data.

       --job-name (string)
          The identifier of the events detection job.

       --language-code (string)
          The language code of the input documents.

          The types of events to detect in the input documents.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          Tags to associate  with  the  events  detection  job.  A  tag  is  a
          key-value  pair that adds metadata to a resource used by Amazon Com-
          prehend. For example, a tag with "Sales" as the key might  be  added
          to a resource to indicate its use by the sales department.

          (structure)
              A  key-value  pair that adds as a metadata to a resource used by
              Amazon Comprehend. For example, a tag with  the  key-value  pair
              Department:Sales  might  be  added to a resource to indicate its
              use by a particular department.

              Key -> (string)
                 The initial part of a key-value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show
                 which resources are used by which departments, you might  use
                 Department as the key portion of the pair, with multiple pos-
                 sible values such as sales, legal, and administration.

              Value -> (string)
                 The second part of a key-value pair that forms a tag  associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show
                 which resources are used by which departments, you might  use
                 Department  as  the initial (key) portion of the pair, with a
                 value of sales to indicate the sales department.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To start an asynchronous events detection job

       The following start-events-detection-job example starts an asynchronous
       events  detection job for all files located at the address specified by
       the  --input-data-config  tag.  Possible  target  event  types  include
       BANKRUPCTY, EMPLOYMENT, CORPORATE_ACQUISITION, INVESTMENT_GENERAL, COR-
       PORATE_MERGER, IPO, RIGHTS_ISSUE,  SECONDARY_OFFERING,  SHELF_OFFERING,
       TENDER_OFFERING,  and  STOCK_SPLIT.  The S3 bucket in this example con-
       tains SampleText1.txt, SampleText2.txt, and SampleText3.txt.  When  the
       job  is  complete, the folder, output, is placed in the location speci-
       fied by the  --output-data-config  tag.  The  folder  contains  Sample-
       Text1.txt.out,  SampleText2.txt.out,  and SampleText3.txt.out. The JSON
       output is printed on one line per file, but is formatted here for read-
       ability.
