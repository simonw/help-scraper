NAME
       describe-document-classification-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the properties associated with a document classification job. Use
       this operation to get the status of a classification job.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-document-classification-job
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The identifier that Amazon Comprehend generated for the job. The op-
          eration returns this identifier in its response.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DocumentClassificationJobProperties -> (structure)
          An object that describes the properties associated with the document
          classification job.

          JobId -> (string)
              The identifier assigned to the document classification job.

          JobArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the document classification
              job. It is a unique, fully qualified identifier for the job.  It
              includes  the AWS account, Region, and the job ID. The format of
              the ARN is as follows:
                 arn:<partition>:comprehend:<region>:<account-id>:docu-
                 ment-classification-job/<job-id>

              The following is an example job ARN:
                 arn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:111122223333:document-classifi-
                 cation-job/1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab

          JobName -> (string)
              The name that you assigned to the document classification job.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the document classification  job.  If  the
              status  is  FAILED  , the Message field shows the reason for the
              failure.

          Message -> (string)
              A description of the status of the job.

          SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the document classification job was submitted  for
              processing.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the document classification job completed.

          DocumentClassifierArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  that identifies the document
              classifier.

          InputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The input data configuration that you supplied when you  created
              the document classification job.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The URI must be in same
                 region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The URI  can
                 point to a single input file or it can provide the prefix for
                 a collection of data files.

                 For example, if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix  ,  if
                 the prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file
                 as input. If more than one file begins with the prefix,  Ama-
                 zon Comprehend uses all of them as input.

              InputFormat -> (string)
                 Specifies how the text in an input file should be processed:

                 o ONE_DOC_PER_FILE - Each file is considered a separate docu-
                   ment. Use this option when you are processing  large  docu-
                   ments, such as newspaper articles or scientific papers.

                 o ONE_DOC_PER_LINE - Each line in a file is considered a sep-
                   arate document. Use this option  when  you  are  processing
                   many short documents, such as text messages.

              DocumentReaderConfig -> (structure)
                 The  document reader config field applies only for InputData-
                 Config of StartEntitiesDetectionJob.

                 Use DocumentReaderConfig to provide specifications about  how
                 you  want your inference documents read. Currently it applies
                 for PDF documents in StartEntitiesDetectionJob custom  infer-
                 ence.

                 DocumentReadAction -> (string)
                     This enum field will start with two values which will ap-
                     ply to PDFs:

                     o TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT - The service  calls  De-
                       tectDocumentText for PDF documents per page.

                     o TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT  - The service calls Analyze-
                       Document for PDF documents per page.

                 DocumentReadMode -> (string)
                     This enum field provides two values:

                     o SERVICE_DEFAULT - use  service  defaults  for  Document
                       reading.  For Digital PDF it would mean using an inter-
                       nal parser instead of Textract APIs

                     o FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION - Always use  specified  ac-
                       tion for DocumentReadAction, including Digital PDF.

                 FeatureTypes -> (list)
                     Specifies  how  the  text in an input file should be pro-
                     cessed:

                     (string)
                        A list of the types of analyses to perform. This field
                        specifies what feature types need to be extracted from
                        the document where entity recognition is expected.

                        o TABLES - Add TABLES to the list to  return  informa-
                          tion about the tables that are detected in the input
                          document.

                        o FORMS - Add FORMS to return detected form data.

          OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The output data configuration that you supplied when you created
              the document classification job.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 When  you  use  the OutputDataConfig object with asynchronous
                 operations, you specify the Amazon S3 location where you want
                 to  write the output data. The URI must be in the same region
                 as the API endpoint that you are  calling.  The  location  is
                 used  as  the  prefix  for  the actual location of the output
                 file.

                 When the topic detection job is finished, the service creates
                 an  output file in a directory specific to the job. The S3Uri
                 field contains the location of the output file,  called  out-
                 put.tar.gz  .  It  is  a compressed archive that contains the
                 ouput of the operation.

                 For a PII entity detection job,  the  output  file  is  plain
                 text,  not  a compressed archive. The output file name is the
                 same as the input file, with .out appended at the end.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 ID for the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key  that  Amazon
                 Comprehend  uses to encrypt the output results from an analy-
                 sis job. The KmsKeyId can be one of the following formats:

                 o KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                 o Amazon   Resource   Name    (ARN)    of    a    KMS    Key:
                   "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                 o KMS Key Alias: "alias/ExampleAlias"

                 o ARN        of        a        KMS        Key         Alias:
                   "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias"

          DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the AWS identity and Access
              Management (IAM) role that grants Amazon Comprehend read  access
              to your input data.

          VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
              ID for the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key that Amazon Com-
              prehend uses to encrypt data on the storage volume  attached  to
              the  ML  compute  instance(s) that process the analysis job. The
              VolumeKmsKeyId can be either of the following formats:

              o KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

              o Amazon    Resource    Name    (ARN)    of    a    KMS     Key:
                "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

          VpcConfig -> (structure)
              Configuration parameters for a  private  Virtual  Private  Cloud
              (VPC)  containing  the resources you are using for your document
              classification job. For more information, see Amazon VPC .

              SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                 The ID number for a security group on  an  instance  of  your
                 private  VPC. Security groups on your VPC function serve as a
                 virtual firewall to control inbound and outbound traffic  and
                 provides  security  for the resources that youll be accessing
                 on the VPC. This ID number is  preceded  by  "sg-",  for  in-
                 stance:  "sg-03b388029b0a285ea".  For  more  information, see
                 Security Groups for your VPC .
