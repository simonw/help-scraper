PUT-RESOURCE-POLICY()                                    PUT-RESOURCE-POLICY()



NAME
       put-resource-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Attaches  a  resource-based  policy to a custom model. You can use this
       policy to authorize an entity in another AWS account to import the cus-
       tom model, which replicates it in Amazon Comprehend in their account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-resource-policy
          --resource-arn <value>
          --resource-policy <value>
          [--policy-revision-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the custom model to attach the
          policy to.

       --resource-policy (string)
          The JSON resource-based policy to attach to your custom model.  Pro-
          vide  your  JSON  as  a UTF-8 encoded string without line breaks. To
          provide valid JSON for your policy, enclose the attribute names  and
          values in double quotes. If the JSON body is also enclosed in double
          quotes, then you must escape the double quotes that are  inside  the
          policy:
              "{\"attribute\": \"value\", \"attribute\": [\"value\"]}"

          To  avoid  escaping quotes, you can use single quotes to enclose the
          policy and double quotes to enclose the JSON names and values:
              '{"attribute": "value", "attribute": ["value"]}'

       --policy-revision-id (string)
          The revision ID that Amazon Comprehend assigned to the  policy  that
          you are updating. If you are creating a new policy that has no prior
          version, don't use this parameter. Amazon Comprehend creates the re-
          vision ID for you.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PolicyRevisionId -> (string)
          The revision ID of the policy. Each time you modify a policy, Amazon
          Comprehend  assigns a new revision ID, and it deletes the prior ver-
          sion of the policy.
