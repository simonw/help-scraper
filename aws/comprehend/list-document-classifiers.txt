LIST-DOCUMENT-CLASSIFIERS()                        LIST-DOCUMENT-CLASSIFIERS()



NAME
       list-document-classifiers -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of the document classifiers that you have created.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-document-classifiers  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: DocumentClassifierPropertiesList

SYNOPSIS
            list-document-classifiers
          [--filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          Filters the jobs that are returned. You can  filter  jobs  on  their
          name, status, or the date and time that they were submitted. You can
          only set one filter at a time.

          Status -> (string)
              Filters the list of classifiers based on status.

          DocumentClassifierName -> (string)
              The name that you assigned to the document classifier

          SubmitTimeBefore -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of classifiers based on the time that the clas-
              sifier  was  submitted  for processing. Returns only classifiers
              submitted before the specified time. Classifiers are returned in
              ascending order, oldest to newest.

          SubmitTimeAfter -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of classifiers based on the time that the clas-
              sifier was submitted for processing.  Returns  only  classifiers
              submitted  after the specified time. Classifiers are returned in
              descending order, newest to oldest.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Status=string,DocumentClassifierName=string,SubmitTimeBefore=timestamp,SubmitTimeAfter=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Status": "SUBMITTED"|"TRAINING"|"DELETING"|"STOP_REQUESTED"|"STOPPED"|"IN_ERROR"|"TRAINED",
            "DocumentClassifierName": "string",
            "SubmitTimeBefore": timestamp,
            "SubmitTimeAfter": timestamp
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DocumentClassifierPropertiesList -> (list)
          A list containing the properties of each job returned.

          (structure)
              Provides information about a document classifier.

              DocumentClassifierArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the document
                 classifier.

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 The language code for the language of the documents that  the
                 classifier was trained on.

              Status -> (string)
                 The  status  of  the  document  classifier.  If the status is
                 TRAINED the classifier is ready to  use.  If  the  status  is
                 FAILED you can see additional information about why the clas-
                 sifier wasn't trained in the Message field.

              Message -> (string)
                 Additional information about the status of the classifier.

              SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that  the  document  classifier  was  submitted  for
                 training.

              EndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that training the document classifier completed.

              TrainingStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 Indicates  the time when the training starts on documentation
                 classifiers. You are billed for  the  time  interval  between
                 this time and the value of TrainingEndTime.

              TrainingEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  that  training of the document classifier was com-
                 pleted. Indicates the time when  the  training  completes  on
                 documentation classifiers. You are billed for the time inter-
                 val between this time and the value of TrainingStartTime.

              InputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The input data configuration that you supplied when you  cre-
                 ated the document classifier for training.

                 DataFormat -> (string)
                     The format of your training data:

                     o COMPREHEND_CSV  :  A  two-column CSV file, where labels
                       are provided in the first  column,  and  documents  are
                       provided in the second. If you use this value, you must
                       provide the S3Uri parameter in your request.

                     o AUGMENTED_MANIFEST : A labeled dataset that is produced
                       by  Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. This file is in JSON
                       lines format. Each line is a complete JSON object  that
                       contains a training document and its associated labels.
                       If you use this value, you must provide the  Augmented-
                       Manifests parameter in your request.

                     If you don't specify a value, Amazon Comprehend uses COM-
                     PREHEND_CSV as the default.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The S3 bucket  must
                     be  in  the  same region as the API endpoint that you are
                     calling. The URI can point to a single input file  or  it
                     can provide the prefix for a collection of input files.

                     For  example, if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix ,
                     if the prefix is a single file,  Amazon  Comprehend  uses
                     that file as input. If more than one file begins with the
                     prefix, Amazon Comprehend uses all of them as input.

                     This parameter is required if you set DataFormat to  COM-
                     PREHEND_CSV .

                 TestS3Uri -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  S3  URI  for  the  input data. The Amazon S3
                     bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the API endpoint
                     that you are calling. The URI can point to a single input
                     file or it can provide the prefix for a collection of in-
                     put files.

                 LabelDelimiter -> (string)
                     Indicates  the  delimiter used to separate each label for
                     training a multi-label classifier. The default  delimiter
                     between  labels  is  a  pipe (|). You can use a different
                     character as a delimiter (if it's an  allowed  character)
                     by  specifying  it  under  Delimiter  for  labels. If the
                     training documents use a delimiter other than the default
                     or  the  delimiter  you  specify, the labels on that line
                     will be combined to make a single unique label,  such  as
                     LABELLABELLABEL.

                 AugmentedManifests -> (list)
                     A  list of augmented manifest files that provide training
                     data for your custom model. An augmented manifest file is
                     a  labeled  dataset  that is produced by Amazon SageMaker
                     Ground Truth.

                     This parameter is required if you set DataFormat to  AUG-
                     MENTED_MANIFEST .

                     (structure)
                        An augmented manifest file that provides training data
                        for your custom model. An augmented manifest file is a
                        labeled  dataset  that is produced by Amazon SageMaker
                        Ground Truth.

                        S3Uri -> (string)
                            The Amazon S3 location of the  augmented  manifest
                            file.

                        Split -> (string)
                            The  purpose  of  the  data you've provided in the
                            augmented manifest. You can either train  or  test
                            this  data.  If  you don't specify, the default is
                            train.

                            TRAIN - all of the documents in the manifest  will
                            be  used  for  training.  If no test documents are
                            provided, Amazon Comprehend will automatically re-
                            serve  a  portion  of  the  training documents for
                            testing.

                            TEST - all of the documents in the  manifest  will
                            be used for testing.

                        AttributeNames -> (list)
                            The  JSON  attribute that contains the annotations
                            for your training documents. The number of  attri-
                            bute  names  that  you  specify depends on whether
                            your augmented manifest file is the  output  of  a
                            single labeling job or a chained labeling job.

                            If  your  file  is the output of a single labeling
                            job, specify the LabelAttributeName key  that  was
                            used when the job was created in Ground Truth.

                            If  your  file is the output of a chained labeling
                            job, specify the LabelAttributeName key for one or
                            more  jobs  in  the chain. Each LabelAttributeName
                            key provides the annotations  from  an  individual
                            job.

                            (string)

                        AnnotationDataS3Uri -> (string)
                            The S3 prefix to the annotation files that are re-
                            ferred in the augmented manifest file.

                        SourceDocumentsS3Uri -> (string)
                            The S3 prefix to the source files (PDFs) that  are
                            referred to in the augmented manifest file.

                        DocumentType -> (string)
                            The  type of augmented manifest. PlainTextDocument
                            or SemiStructuredDocument. If you  don't  specify,
                            the default is PlainTextDocument.

                            o PLAIN_TEXT_DOCUMENT  A document type that repre-
                              sents any unicode text that is encoded in UTF-8.

                            o SEMI_STRUCTURED_DOCUMENT A  document  type  with
                              positional  and  structural context, like a PDF.
                              For training with Amazon Comprehend,  only  PDFs
                              are  supported. For inference, Amazon Comprehend
                              support PDFs, DOCX and TXT.

              OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 Provides output results configuration parameters  for  custom
                 classifier jobs.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     When you use the OutputDataConfig object while creating a
                     custom classifier, you specify  the  Amazon  S3  location
                     where  you  want  to  write the confusion matrix. The URI
                     must be in the same region as the API endpoint  that  you
                     are  calling.  The location is used as the prefix for the
                     actual location of this output file.

                     When the custom classifier job is finished,  the  service
                     creates  the  output  file in a directory specific to the
                     job. The S3Uri field contains the location of the  output
                     file,  called  output.tar.gz . It is a compressed archive
                     that contains the confusion matrix.

                 KmsKeyId -> (string)
                     ID for the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key that Ama-
                     zon Comprehend uses to encrypt the output results from an
                     analysis job. The KmsKeyId can be one  of  the  following
                     formats:

                     o KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                     o Amazon    Resource   Name   (ARN)   of   a   KMS   Key:
                       "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                     o KMS Key Alias: "alias/ExampleAlias"

                     o ARN        of        a       KMS       Key       Alias:
                       "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias"

              ClassifierMetadata -> (structure)
                 Information about the document classifier, including the num-
                 ber of documents used for training the classifier, the number
                 of documents used for test the classifier,  and  an  accuracy
                 rating.

                 NumberOfLabels -> (integer)
                     The number of labels in the input data.

                 NumberOfTrainedDocuments -> (integer)
                     The  number of documents in the input data that were used
                     to train the classifier. Typically this is 80 to 90  per-
                     cent of the input documents.

                 NumberOfTestDocuments -> (integer)
                     The  number of documents in the input data that were used
                     to test the classifier. Typically this is 10 to  20  per-
                     cent of the input documents, up to 10,000 documents.

                 EvaluationMetrics -> (structure)
                     Describes the result metrics for the test data associated
                     with an documentation classifier.

                     Accuracy -> (double)
                        The fraction of the labels that  were  correct  recog-
                        nized. It is computed by dividing the number of labels
                        in the test documents that were  correctly  recognized
                        by the total number of labels in the test documents.

                     Precision -> (double)
                        A  measure of the usefulness of the classifier results
                        in the test data. High precision means that the  clas-
                        sifier  returned  substantially  more relevant results
                        than irrelevant ones.

                     Recall -> (double)
                        A measure of how complete the classifier  results  are
                        for  the test data. High recall means that the classi-
                        fier returned most of the relevant results.

                     F1Score -> (double)
                        A measure of how accurate the classifier  results  are
                        for  the  test  data. It is derived from the Precision
                        and Recall values. The F1Score is the harmonic average
                        of  the  two  scores.  The highest score is 1, and the
                        worst score is 0.

                     MicroPrecision -> (double)
                        A measure of the usefulness of the recognizer  results
                        in the test data. High precision means that the recog-
                        nizer returned  substantially  more  relevant  results
                        than  irrelevant  ones.  Unlike  the  Precision metric
                        which comes from averaging the precision of all avail-
                        able labels, this is based on the overall score of all
                        precision scores added together.

                     MicroRecall -> (double)
                        A measure of how complete the classifier  results  are
                        for  the test data. High recall means that the classi-
                        fier returned most of the relevant  results.  Specifi-
                        cally,  this  indicates  how many of the correct cate-
                        gories in the text that the model can predict. It is a
                        percentage  of correct categories in the text that can
                        found. Instead of averaging the recall scores  of  all
                        labels  (as with Recall), micro Recall is based on the
                        overall score of all recall scores added together.

                     MicroF1Score -> (double)
                        A measure of how accurate the classifier  results  are
                        for  the  test  data. It is a combination of the Micro
                        Precision and Micro Recall values. The  Micro  F1Score
                        is  the  harmonic  mean of the two scores. The highest
                        score is 1, and the worst score is 0.

                     HammingLoss -> (double)
                        Indicates the fraction of labels that are  incorrectly
                        predicted.  Also  seen as the fraction of wrong labels
                        compared to the total number of labels. Scores  closer
                        to zero are better.
