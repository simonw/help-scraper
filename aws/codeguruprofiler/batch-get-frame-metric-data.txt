          [--frame-metrics <value>]
          [--period <value>]
          --profiling-group-name <value>

OPTIONS
       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end time of the time period for the returned time series values.
          This   is   specified  using  the  ISO  8601  format.  For  example,
          2020-06-01T13:15:02.001Z represents 1 millisecond past June 1,  2020
          1:15:02 PM UTC.

       --frame-metrics (list)
          The details of the metrics that are used to request a time series of
          values. The metric includes the name of the frame,  the  aggregation
          type  to  calculate  the  metric value for the frame, and the thread
          states to use to get the count for the metric value of the frame.

          (structure)
              The frame name, metric type, and thread states. These  are  used
              to derive the value of the metric for the frame.

              frameName -> (string)
                 Name  of the method common across the multiple occurrences of
                 a frame in an application profile.

              threadStates -> (list)
                 List of application runtime thread states  used  to  get  the
                 counts for a frame a derive a metric value.

                 (string)

              type -> (string)
                 A type of aggregation that specifies how a metric for a frame
                 is analyzed. The supported value  AggregatedRelativeTotalTime
                 is  an  aggregation of the metric value for one frame that is
                 calculated across the occurrences of all frames in a profile.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          frameName=string,threadStates=string,string,type=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "frameName": "string",
              "threadStates": ["string", ...],
              "type": "AggregatedRelativeTotalTime"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --period (string)
          The duration of the frame metrics used to  return  the  time  series
          values.  Specify using the ISO 8601 format. The maximum period dura-
          tion is one day (PT24H or P1D ).

       --profiling-group-name (string)
          The name of the profiling group associated with the the  frame  met-
          rics used to return the time series values.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The  start time of the time period for the frame metrics used to re-
          turn the time series values. This is specified using  the  ISO  8601
          format. For example, 2020-06-01T13:15:02.001Z represents 1 millisec-
          ond past June 1, 2020 1:15:02 PM UTC.

       --target-resolution (string)
          The requested resolution of time steps for the returned time  series
          of  values.  If the requested target resolution is not available due
          to data not being retained we provide a best effort result by  fall-
          ing  back to the most granular available resolution after the target
          resolution. There are 3 valid values.

          o P1D  1 day

          o PT1H  1 hour

          o PT5M  5 minutes

          Possible values:

          o PT5M

          o PT1H

          o P1D

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       endTime -> (timestamp)

                     tiveTotalTime is an aggregation of the metric  value  for
                     one  frame  that  is calculated across the occurrences of
                     all frames in a profile.
