NAME
       list-findings-reports -

DESCRIPTION
       List the available reports for a given profiling group and time range.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-findings-reports
          [--daily-reports-only | --no-daily-reports-only]
          --end-time <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          --profiling-group-name <value>
          --start-time <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --daily-reports-only | --no-daily-reports-only (boolean)
          A Boolean value indicating whether to only return reports from daily
          profiles. If set to True , only analysis data from daily profiles is
          returned.  If  set to False , analysis data is returned from smaller
          time windows (for example, one hour).

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end time of the profile to get analysis  data  about.  You  must
          specify startTime and endTime . This is specified using the ISO 8601
          format. For example, 2020-06-01T13:15:02.001Z represents 1 millisec-
          ond past June 1, 2020 1:15:02 PM UTC.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of report results returned by ListFindingsReports
          in paginated output. When this parameter  is  used,  ListFindingsRe-
          ports  only returns maxResults results in a single page along with a
          nextToken response element. The remaining results of the initial re-
          quest  can  be  seen  by sending another ListFindingsReports request
          with the returned nextToken value.

       --next-token (string)
          The nextToken value returned from  a  previous  paginated  ListFind-
          ingsReportsRequest request where maxResults was used and the results
          exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from  the
          end of the previous results that returned the nextToken value.

          NOTE:
              This  token  should  be  treated as an opaque identifier that is
              only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other
              programmatic purposes.

       --profiling-group-name (string)
          The  name  of  the profiling group from which to search for analysis
          data.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start time of the profile to get analysis data about.  You  must
          specify startTime and endTime . This is specified using the ISO 8601
          format. For example, 2020-06-01T13:15:02.001Z represents 1 millisec-
          ond past June 1, 2020 1:15:02 PM UTC.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       findingsReportSummaries -> (list)
          The list of analysis results summaries.

          (structure)
              Information  about  potential recommendations that might be cre-
              ated from the analysis of profiling data.

              id -> (string)
                 The universally unique identifier (UUID) of  the  recommenda-
                 tion report.

              profileEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The end time of the period during which the metric is flagged
                 as anomalous. This is specified using the  ISO  8601  format.
                 For  example, 2020-06-01T13:15:02.001Z represents 1 millisec-
                 ond past June 1, 2020 1:15:02 PM UTC.

              profileStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The start time of the profile the  analysis  data  is  about.
                 This  is  specified  using  the ISO 8601 format. For example,
                 2020-06-01T13:15:02.001Z represents 1 millisecond  past  June
                 1, 2020 1:15:02 PM UTC.

              profilingGroupName -> (string)
                 The  name  of the profiling group that is associated with the
                 analysis data.

              totalNumberOfFindings -> (integer)
                 The total number of different recommendations that were found
                 by the analysis.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  nextToken  value to include in a future ListFindingsReports re-
          quest. When the results  of  a  ListFindingsReports  request  exceed
          maxResults , this value can be used to retrieve the next page of re-
          sults. This value is null when there are no more results to return.
