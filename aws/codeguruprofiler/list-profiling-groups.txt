NAME
       list-profiling-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of profiling groups. The profiling groups are returned
       as                     `                      ProfilingGroupDescription
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/profiler-api/API_ProfilingGroupDescription.html`__
       objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-profiling-groups
          [--include-description | --no-include-description]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --include-description | --no-include-description (boolean)
          A Boolean value indicating whether to include a description. If true
          ,     then     a     list     of     `     ProfilingGroupDescription
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/profiler-api/API_ProfilingGroupDescription.html`__
          objects  that contain detailed information about profiling groups is
          returned. If false , then a list of profiling  group  names  is  re-
          turned.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of profiling groups results returned by ListPro-
          filingGroups in paginated output. When this parameter is used, List-
          ProfilingGroups  only  returns  maxResults  results in a single page
          along with a nextToken response element. The  remaining  results  of
          the  initial  request  can be seen by sending another ListProfiling-
          Groups request with the returned nextToken value.

       --next-token (string)
          The nextToken value returned from a previous  paginated  ListProfil-
          ingGroups request where maxResults was used and the results exceeded
          the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from  the  end  of
          the previous results that returned the nextToken value.

          NOTE:
              This  token  should  be  treated as an opaque identifier that is
              only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other
              programmatic purposes.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          The  nextToken  value to include in a future ListProfilingGroups re-
          quest. When the results  of  a  ListProfilingGroups  request  exceed
          maxResults , this value can be used to retrieve the next page of re-
          sults. This value is null when there are no more results to return.

       profilingGroupNames -> (list)
          A returned list of profiling group names. A list of the names is re-
          turned  only  if includeDescription is false , otherwise a list of `
          ProfilingGroupDescription
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/profiler-api/API_ProfilingGroupDescription.html`__
          objects is returned.

                 profilingEnabled -> (boolean)
                     A Boolean that specifies whether the profiling agent col-

                 AWSLambda , then the profiled application runs on AWS Lambda.
                 If  it is set to Default , then the profiled application runs
                 on a compute platform that is not AWS Lambda, such an  Amazon
                 EC2 instance, an on-premises server, or a different platform.
