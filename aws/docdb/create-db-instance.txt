OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          The  instance  identifier.  This  parameter is stored as a lowercase
          string.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o The first character must be a letter.

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          Example: mydbinstance

       --db-instance-class (string)
          The compute and  memory  capacity  of  the  instance;  for  example,
          db.r5.large .

       --engine (string)
          The name of the database engine to be used for this instance.

          Valid value: docdb

       --availability-zone (string)
          The Amazon EC2 Availability Zone that the instance is created in.

          Default: A random, system-chosen Availability Zone in the endpoint's
          Region.

          Example: us-east-1d

       --preferred-maintenance-window (string)
          The time range each week during which system maintenance can  occur,
          in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

          Format: ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi

          The  default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour
          block of time for each Region, occurring on  a  random  day  of  the
          week.

          Valid days: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun

          Constraints: Minimum 30-minute window.

       --auto-minor-version-upgrade  |  --no-auto-minor-version-upgrade (bool-
       ean)
          This parameter does not apply to  Amazon  DocumentDB.  Amazon  Docu-
          mentDB  does  not  perform  minor version upgrades regardless of the
          value set.

          Default: false

       --tags (list)
          The tags to be assigned to the instance. You can  assign  up  to  10
          tags to an instance.

          (structure)
              Metadata assigned to an Amazon DocumentDB resource consisting of
              a key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 The required name of the tag. The string value can be from  1
                 to  128  Unicode  characters  in length and can't be prefixed
                 with "aws: " or "rds: ". The string can contain only the  set
                 of  Unicode letters, digits, white space, '_', '.', '/', '=',
                 '+', '-' (Java regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional value of the tag. The string value can be from 1
                 to  256  Unicode  characters  in length and can't be prefixed
                 with "aws: " or "rds: ". The string can contain only the  set
                 of  Unicode letters, digits, white space, '_', '.', '/', '=',
                 '+', '-' (Java regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the cluster that the instance will belong to.

       --promotion-tier (integer)
          A value that specifies the  order  in  which  an  Amazon  DocumentDB
          replica  is  promoted to the primary instance after a failure of the
          existing primary instance.

          Default: 1

          Valid values: 0-15

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create an Amazon DocumentDB cluster instance

       The following create-db-instance example code creates the instance sam-
       ple-cluster-instance-2 in the Amazon DocumentDB cluster sample-cluster.

          aws docdb create-db-instance \
              --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster \
              --db-instance-class db.r4.xlarge \
