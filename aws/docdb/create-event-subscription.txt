CREATE-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTION()                        CREATE-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTION()



NAME
       create-event-subscription -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an Amazon DocumentDB event notification subscription. This ac-
       tion requires a topic Amazon Resource Name (ARN) created by  using  the
       Amazon  DocumentDB  console,  the Amazon SNS console, or the Amazon SNS
       API. To obtain an ARN with Amazon SNS, you must create a topic in  Ama-
       zon  SNS and subscribe to the topic. The ARN is displayed in the Amazon
       SNS console.

       You can specify the type of source (SourceType ) that you  want  to  be
       notified  of.  You can also provide a list of Amazon DocumentDB sources
       (SourceIds ) that trigger the events, and you can  provide  a  list  of
       event  categories (EventCategories ) for events that you want to be no-
       tified of. For example, you can  specify  SourceType  =  db-instance  ,
       SourceIds  =  mydbinstance1, mydbinstance2 and EventCategories = Avail-
       ability, Backup .

       If you specify both the SourceType and SourceIds (such as SourceType  =
       db-instance and SourceIdentifier = myDBInstance1 ), you are notified of
       all the db-instance events for the specified source. If you  specify  a
       SourceType  but  do not specify a SourceIdentifier , you receive notice
       of the events for that source  type  for  all  your  Amazon  DocumentDB
       sources. If you do not specify either the SourceType or the SourceIden-
       tifier , you are notified of events generated  from  all  Amazon  Docu-
       mentDB sources belonging to your customer account.

SYNOPSIS
            create-event-subscription
          --subscription-name <value>
          --sns-topic-arn <value>
          [--source-type <value>]
          [--event-categories <value>]
          [--source-ids <value>]
          [--enabled | --no-enabled]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subscription-name (string)
          The name of the subscription.

          Constraints: The name must be fewer than 255 characters.

       --sns-topic-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the SNS topic created for event
          notification. Amazon SNS creates the ARN when you create a topic and
          subscribe to it.

       --source-type (string)
          The  type  of  source that is generating the events. For example, if
          you want to be notified of events  generated  by  an  instance,  you
          would set this parameter to db-instance . If this value is not spec-
          ified, all events are returned.

          Valid values: db-instance , db-cluster , db-parameter-group , db-se-
          curity-group , db-cluster-snapshot

       --event-categories (list)
          A  list  of  event categories for a SourceType that you want to sub-
          scribe to.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --source-ids (list)
          The list of identifiers of the event sources for  which  events  are
          returned. If not specified, then all sources are included in the re-
          sponse. An identifier must begin with a letter and must contain only
          ASCII  letters,  digits,  and hyphens; it can't end with a hyphen or
          contain two consecutive hyphens.

          Constraints:

          o If SourceIds are provided, SourceType must also be provided.

          o If the source type is an instance, a DBInstanceIdentifier must  be
            provided.

          o If the source type is a security group, a DBSecurityGroupName must
            be provided.

          o If the source type is a parameter  group,  a  DBParameterGroupName
            must be provided.

          o If  the  source type is a snapshot, a DBSnapshotIdentifier must be
            provided.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --enabled | --no-enabled (boolean)
          A Boolean value; set to true to activate the  subscription,  set  to
          false to create the subscription but not active it.

       --tags (list)
          The tags to be assigned to the event subscription.

          (structure)
              Metadata assigned to an Amazon DocumentDB resource consisting of
              a key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 The required name of the tag. The string value can be from  1
                 to  128  Unicode  characters  in length and can't be prefixed
                 with "aws: " or "rds: ". The string can contain only the  set
                 of  Unicode letters, digits, white space, '_', '.', '/', '=',
                 '+', '-' (Java regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional value of the tag. The string value can be from 1
                 to  256  Unicode  characters  in length and can't be prefixed
                 with "aws: " or "rds: ". The string can contain only the  set
                 of  Unicode letters, digits, white space, '_', '.', '/', '=',
                 '+', '-' (Java regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
