DELETE-DB-CLUSTER()                                        DELETE-DB-CLUSTER()



NAME
       delete-db-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  previously  provisioned cluster. When you delete a cluster,
       all automated backups for that cluster are deleted and can't be  recov-
       ered.  Manual  DB  cluster  snapshots  of the specified cluster are not
       deleted.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-db-cluster
          --db-cluster-identifier <value>
          [--skip-final-snapshot | --no-skip-final-snapshot]
          [--final-db-snapshot-identifier <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The cluster identifier for the cluster to be deleted. This parameter
          isn't case sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must match an existing DBClusterIdentifier .

       --skip-final-snapshot | --no-skip-final-snapshot (boolean)
          Determines  whether  a  final cluster snapshot is created before the
          cluster is deleted. If true is specified,  no  cluster  snapshot  is
          created. If false is specified, a cluster snapshot is created before
          the DB cluster is deleted.

          NOTE:
              If SkipFinalSnapshot is false , you must specify a  FinalDBSnap-
              shotIdentifier parameter.

          Default: false

       --final-db-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The  cluster snapshot identifier of the new cluster snapshot created
          when SkipFinalSnapshot is set to false .

          NOTE:
              Specifying this parameter and also setting the SkipFinalShapshot
              parameter to true results in an error.

          Constraints:

          o Must be from 1 to 255 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o The first character must be a letter.

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete an Amazon DocumentDB cluster

       The following delete-db-cluster example deletes the  Amazon  DocumentDB
       cluster  sample-cluster.  No  backup  of  the  cluster is made prior to
       deleting it. NOTE: You must delete all instances  associated  with  the
       cluster before you can delete it.

          aws docdb delete-db-cluster \
              --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster \
              --skip-final-snapshot

OUTPUT
       DBCluster -> (structure)
          Detailed information about a cluster.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides the list of Amazon  EC2  Availability  Zones  that  in-
              stances in the cluster can be created in.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              Specifies  the  number of days for which automatic snapshots are
              retained.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains a user-supplied cluster identifier. This identifier  is
              the unique key that identifies a cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              Specifies  the name of the cluster parameter group for the clus-
              ter.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Specifies information on the subnet  group  that  is  associated
              with  the  cluster, including the name, description, and subnets
              in the subnet group.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this cluster.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

          EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              The earliest time to which  a  database  can  be  restored  with
              point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              Specifies  the  connection  endpoint for the primary instance of
              the cluster.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The reader endpoint for the cluster. The reader endpoint  for  a
              cluster  load  balances connections across the Amazon DocumentDB
              replicas that are available in a cluster. As clients request new
              connections  to  the reader endpoint, Amazon DocumentDB distrib-
              utes the connection requests among the Amazon DocumentDB  repli-
              cas  in  the  cluster.  This functionality can help balance your
              read workload across multiple Amazon DocumentDB replicas in your
              cluster.

              If a failover occurs, and the Amazon DocumentDB replica that you
              are connected to is promoted to be the  primary  instance,  your
              connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to
              other Amazon DocumentDB replicas in the cluster,  you  can  then
              reconnect to the reader endpoint.

          MultiAZ -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  the cluster has instances in multiple Avail-
              ability Zones.

              Specifies the weekly time range during which system  maintenance
              can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

          ReplicationSourceIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains the identifier of the source cluster if this cluster is
              a secondary cluster.

          ReadReplicaIdentifiers -> (list)
              Contains one or more identifiers of the secondary clusters  that
              are associated with this cluster.

              (string)

          DBClusterMembers -> (list)
              Provides the list of instances that make up the cluster.

              (structure)
                 Contains  information  about  an  instance  that is part of a

                     a failure of the existing primary instance.

          VpcSecurityGroups -> (list)
              Provides  a  list of virtual private cloud (VPC) security groups
              that the cluster belongs to.

              whenever the KMS key for the cluster is accessed.

          DBClusterArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the cluster.

          AssociatedRoles -> (list)
              Provides  a  list  of  the  Identity and Access Management (IAM)
              roles that are associated with the cluster. (IAM) roles that are
              associated  with  a  cluster grant permission for the cluster to
              access other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf.

              (structure)
                 Describes an Identity and Access Management (IAM)  role  that
                 is associated with a cluster.

                     following values:

                     o ACTIVE - The IAMrole ARN is associated with the cluster
                       and  can  be  used  to access other Amazon Web Services
                       services on your behalf.

                     o PENDING - The IAMrole ARN is being associated with  the
                       cluster.

                     o INVALID  - The IAMrole ARN is associated with the clus-
                       ter, but the cluster cannot assume the IAMrole  to  ac-
                       cess other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf.
