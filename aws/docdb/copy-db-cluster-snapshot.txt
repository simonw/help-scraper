COPY-DB-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()                          COPY-DB-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       copy-db-cluster-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Copies a snapshot of a cluster.

       To  copy  a  cluster  snapshot  from  a shared manual cluster snapshot,
       SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier must  be  the  Amazon  Resource  Name
       (ARN)  of  the  shared  cluster snapshot. You can only copy a shared DB
       cluster snapshot, whether encrypted or not, in the same Region.

       To cancel the copy operation after it is in progress, delete the target
       cluster  snapshot identified by TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier while
       that cluster snapshot is in the copying status.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            copy-db-cluster-snapshot
          --source-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier <value>
          --target-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier <value>
          [--kms-key-id <value>]
          [--pre-signed-url <value>]
          [--copy-tags | --no-copy-tags]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--source-region <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the cluster snapshot to copy.  This  parameter  is
          not case sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must specify a valid system snapshot in the available state.

          o If  the source snapshot is in the same Region as the copy, specify
            a valid snapshot identifier.

          o If the source snapshot is in a different  Region  than  the  copy,
            specify a valid cluster snapshot ARN.

          Example: my-cluster-snapshot1

       --target-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the new cluster snapshot to create from the source
          cluster snapshot. This parameter is not case sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o The first character must be a letter.

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          Example: my-cluster-snapshot2

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The KMS key ID for an encrypted cluster snapshot. The KMS key ID  is
          the  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN), KMS key identifier, or the KMS key
          alias for the KMS encryption key.

          If you copy an encrypted cluster snapshot from your account, you can
          specify  a value for KmsKeyId to encrypt the copy with a new KMS en-
          cryption key. If you don't specify a value for KmsKeyId ,  then  the
          copy  of  the cluster snapshot is encrypted with the same KMS key as
          the source cluster snapshot.

          If you copy an encrypted cluster snapshot that is  shared  from  an-
          other account, then you must specify a value for KmsKeyId .

          To  copy  an  encrypted  cluster  snapshot  to  another  Region, set
          KmsKeyId to the KMS key ID that you want to use to encrypt the  copy
          of  the  cluster  snapshot in the destination Region. KMS encryption
          keys are specific to the Region that they are created  in,  and  you
          can't use encryption keys from one Region in another Region.

          If  you copy an unencrypted cluster snapshot and specify a value for
          the KmsKeyId parameter, an error is returned.

       --pre-signed-url (string)
          The URL that contains a  Signature  Version  4  signed  request  for
          the``CopyDBClusterSnapshot``  API action in the Region that contains
          the source cluster snapshot to copy. You must use  the  PreSignedUrl
          parameter when copying a cluster snapshot from another Region.

          If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can
          specify SourceRegion (or --source-region for  the  CLI)  instead  of
          specifying PreSignedUrl manually. Specifying SourceRegion autogener-
          ates a pre-signed URL that is a valid request for the operation that
          can be executed in the source Region.

          The presigned URL must be a valid request for the CopyDBClusterSnap-
          shot API action that can be executed in the source Region that  con-
          tains  the  cluster snapshot to be copied. The presigned URL request
          must contain the following parameter values:

          o SourceRegion - The ID of the region that contains the snapshot  to
            be copied.

          o SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier - The identifier for the the en-
            crypted cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be  in
            the  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Region. For
            example, if you are copying an encrypted cluster snapshot from the
            us-east-1   Region,  then  your  SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier
            looks        something         like         the         following:
            arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:12345678012:sample-cluster:sample-clus-
            ter-snapshot .

          o TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier - The  identifier  for  the  new
            cluster  snapshot  to be created. This parameter isn't case sensi-
            tive.

       --copy-tags | --no-copy-tags (boolean)
          Set to true to copy all tags from the source cluster snapshot to the
          target  cluster snapshot, and otherwise false . The default is false
          .

       --tags (list)
          The tags to be assigned to the cluster snapshot.

          (structure)
              Metadata assigned to an Amazon DocumentDB resource consisting of
              a key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 The  required name of the tag. The string value can be from 1
                 to 128 Unicode characters in length  and  can't  be  prefixed
                 with  "aws: " or "rds: ". The string can contain only the set
                 of Unicode letters, digits, white space, '_', '.', '/',  '=',
                 '+', '-' (Java regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional value of the tag. The string value can be from 1
                 to 256 Unicode characters in length  and  can't  be  prefixed
                 with  "aws: " or "rds: ". The string can contain only the set
                 of Unicode letters, digits, white space, '_', '.', '/',  '=',
                 '+', '-' (Java regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --source-region (string)
          The ID of the region that contains the snapshot to be copied.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a copy of a snapshot

       The  following  copy-db-cluster-snapshot  example  makes a copy of sam-
       ple-cluster-snapshot named sample-cluster-snapshot-copy. The  copy  has
       all  the tags of the original plus a new tag with the key name CopyNum-
       ber.

          aws docdb copy-db-cluster-snapshot \
              --source-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier sample-cluster-snapshot \
              --target-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier sample-cluster-snapshot-copy \
              --copy-tags \
              --tags Key="CopyNumber",Value="1"

       This command produces no output.
