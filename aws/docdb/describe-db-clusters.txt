DESCRIBE-DB-CLUSTERS()                                  DESCRIBE-DB-CLUSTERS()



NAME
       describe-db-clusters -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about provisioned Amazon DocumentDB clusters. This
       API operation supports pagination. For certain management features such
       as  cluster and instance lifecycle management, Amazon DocumentDB lever-
       ages operational technology that is shared with Amazon RDS  and  Amazon
       Neptune. Use the filterName=engine,Values=docdb filter parameter to re-
       turn only Amazon DocumentDB clusters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-db-clusters is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: DBClusters

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  user-provided  cluster  identifier. If this parameter is speci-
          fied, information from only the specific cluster is  returned.  This
          parameter isn't case sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o If provided, must match an existing DBClusterIdentifier .

       --filters (list)
          A filter that specifies one or more clusters to describe.

          Supported filters:

          o db-cluster-id - Accepts cluster identifiers and cluster Amazon Re-
            source Names (ARNs). The results list  only  includes  information
            about the clusters identified by these ARNs.

          (structure)
              A  named  set  of  filter values, used to return a more specific
              list of results. You can use a filter to  match  a  set  of  re-
              sources by specific criteria, such as IDs.

              Wildcards are not supported in filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get detailed information about one or more Amazon  DocumentDB  clus-
       ters.

       The  following  describe-db-clusters  example  displays details for the
       Amazon DocumentDB cluster sample-cluster. By  omitting  the  --db-clus-
       ter-identifier parameter you can get information of up to 100 clusters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter  is  specified,  the response includes only records beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .

       DBClusters -> (list)
          A list of clusters.

          (structure)
              Detailed information about a cluster.

              AvailabilityZones -> (list)
                 Provides the list of Amazon EC2 Availability Zones  that  in-
                 stances in the cluster can be created in.

                 (string)

              BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
                 Specifies  the  number  of days for which automatic snapshots
                 are retained.

              DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
                 Contains a user-supplied cluster identifier. This  identifier
                 is the unique key that identifies a cluster.

              DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  name  of  the cluster parameter group for the
                 cluster.

              DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
                 Specifies information on the subnet group that is  associated
                 with  the  cluster, including the name, description, and sub-
                 nets in the subnet group.

              Status -> (string)
                 Specifies the current state of this cluster.

              PercentProgress -> (string)
                 Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

              EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
                 The earliest time to which a database can  be  restored  with
                 point-in-time restore.

              Endpoint -> (string)
                 Specifies the connection endpoint for the primary instance of
                 the cluster.

              ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
                 The reader endpoint for the cluster. The reader endpoint  for
                 a  cluster  load balances connections across the Amazon Docu-
                 mentDB replicas that are available in a cluster.  As  clients
                 request  new connections to the reader endpoint, Amazon Docu-
                 mentDB distributes the connection requests among  the  Amazon
                 DocumentDB  replicas  in  the cluster. This functionality can
                 help balance your read workload across multiple Amazon  Docu-
                 mentDB replicas in your cluster.

                 If  a failover occurs, and the Amazon DocumentDB replica that
                 you are connected to is promoted to be the primary  instance,
                 your  connection  is  dropped.  To continue sending your read
                 workload to other Amazon DocumentDB replicas in the  cluster,
                 you can then reconnect to the reader endpoint.

              MultiAZ -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  the  cluster  has  instances  in multiple
                 Availability Zones.

                 Specifies the latest time to which a database can be restored
                 with point-in-time restore.

              Port -> (integer)
                 Specifies the port that the database engine is listening on.

              MasterUsername -> (string)

              PreferredBackupWindow -> (string)
                 Specifies the daily time range during which automated backups
                 are  created  if automated backups are enabled, as determined
                 by the BackupRetentionPeriod .

              PreferredMaintenanceWindow -> (string)
                 Specifies the weekly time range during which  system  mainte-
                 nance can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

              ReplicationSourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 Contains the identifier of the source cluster if this cluster
                 is a secondary cluster.

              ReadReplicaIdentifiers -> (list)
                 Contains one or more identifiers of  the  secondary  clusters
                 that are associated with this cluster.

                 (string)

              DBClusterMembers -> (list)
                 Provides the list of instances that make up the cluster.

                     Contains  information about an instance that is part of a
                     cluster.

                     DBInstanceIdentifier -> (string)
                        Specifies the instance identifier for this  member  of
                        the cluster.

                     IsClusterWriter -> (boolean)
                        A value that is true if the cluster member is the pri-
                        mary instance for the cluster and false otherwise.

                     DBClusterParameterGroupStatus -> (string)
                        Specifies the status of the  cluster  parameter  group
                        for this member of the DB cluster.

                     PromotionTier -> (integer)
                        A  value  that  specifies the order in which an Amazon
                        DocumentDB replica is promoted to the primary instance
                        after a failure of the existing primary instance.

              VpcSecurityGroups -> (list)
                 Provides  a  list  of  virtual  private  cloud (VPC) security

                 entries whenever the KMS key for the cluster is accessed.

              DBClusterArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the cluster.

              AssociatedRoles -> (list)
                 Provides  a  list of the Identity and Access Management (IAM)
                 roles that are associated with the cluster. (IAM) roles  that
                 are  associated with a cluster grant permission for the clus-
                 ter to access other Amazon Web Services services on your  be-

                 (structure)
                     Describes  an  Identity  and Access Management (IAM) role
                     that is associated with a cluster.

                     RoleArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAMrole that  is
                        associated with the DB cluster.

                     Status -> (string)
                        Describes the state of association between the IAMrole
                        and the cluster. The Status property  returns  one  of
                        the following values:

                        o ACTIVE  -  The  IAMrole  ARN  is associated with the
                          cluster and can be used to access other  Amazon  Web
                          Services services on your behalf.

                        o PENDING  -  The IAMrole ARN is being associated with
                          the cluster.

                        o INVALID - The IAMrole ARN  is  associated  with  the
                          cluster,  but  the cluster cannot assume the IAMrole
                          to access other Amazon Web Services services on your
                          behalf.

              CloneGroupId -> (string)
                 Identifies the clone group to which the DB cluster is associ-
                 ated.

              ClusterCreateTime -> (timestamp)
                 Specifies the time when the cluster was created, in Universal
                 Coordinated Time (UTC).

              EnabledCloudwatchLogsExports -> (list)
                 A list of log types that this cluster is configured to export
                 to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

                 (string)

              DeletionProtection -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether this cluster can be deleted.  If  Deletion-
                 Protection  is  enabled, the cluster cannot be deleted unless
                 it is modified and DeletionProtection is disabled.  Deletion-
                 Protection protects clusters from being accidentally deleted.

              StorageType -> (string)
                 Storage type associated with your cluster

                 Storage type associated with your cluster
