DELETE-DB-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()                      DELETE-DB-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       delete-db-cluster-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  cluster snapshot. If the snapshot is being copied, the copy
       operation is terminated.

       NOTE:
          The cluster snapshot must be in the available state to be deleted.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-db-cluster-snapshot
          --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the cluster snapshot to delete.

          Constraints: Must be the name of an existing cluster snapshot in the
          available state.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete an Amazon DocumentDB cluster snapshot

       The  following  delete-db-cluster-snapshot  example  deletes the Amazon
       DocumentDB cluster snapshot sample-cluster-snapshot.

          aws docdb delete-db-cluster-snapshot \
              --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier sample-cluster-snapshot

       Output:
