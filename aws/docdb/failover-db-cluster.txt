FAILOVER-DB-CLUSTER()                                    FAILOVER-DB-CLUSTER()



NAME
       failover-db-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Forces a failover for a cluster.

       A failover for a cluster promotes one of the Amazon DocumentDB replicas
       (read-only instances) in the cluster to be the  primary  instance  (the
       cluster writer).

       If  the  primary  instance fails, Amazon DocumentDB automatically fails
       over to an Amazon DocumentDB replica, if one exists. You  can  force  a
       failover  when you want to simulate a failure of a primary instance for
       testing.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            failover-db-cluster
          [--db-cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--target-db-instance-identifier <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          A cluster identifier to force a failover for. This parameter is  not
          case sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing DBCluster .

       --target-db-instance-identifier (string)
          The name of the instance to promote to the primary instance.

          You  must  specify  the instance identifier for an Amazon DocumentDB
          replica in the cluster. For example, mydbcluster-replica1 .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To force an Amazon DocumentDB cluster to failover to a replica

       The  following  failover-db-cluster example causes the primary instance
       in the Amazon  DocumentDB  cluster  sample-cluster  to  failover  to  a
       replica.

          aws docdb failover-db-cluster \
              --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster

OUTPUT
       DBCluster -> (structure)
          Detailed information about a cluster.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides the list of Amazon  EC2  Availability  Zones  that  in-
              stances in the cluster can be created in.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              Specifies  the  number of days for which automatic snapshots are
              retained.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains a user-supplied cluster identifier. This identifier  is
              the unique key that identifies a cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              Specifies  the name of the cluster parameter group for the clus-
              ter.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Specifies information on the subnet  group  that  is  associated
              with  the  cluster, including the name, description, and subnets
              in the subnet group.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this cluster.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

          EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              The earliest time to which  a  database  can  be  restored  with
              point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              Specifies  the  connection  endpoint for the primary instance of
              the cluster.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The reader endpoint for the cluster. The reader endpoint  for  a
              cluster  load  balances connections across the Amazon DocumentDB
              replicas that are available in a cluster. As clients request new
              connections  to  the reader endpoint, Amazon DocumentDB distrib-
              utes the connection requests among the Amazon DocumentDB  repli-
              cas  in  the  cluster.  This functionality can help balance your
              read workload across multiple Amazon DocumentDB replicas in your
              cluster.

              If a failover occurs, and the Amazon DocumentDB replica that you
              are connected to is promoted to be the  primary  instance,  your
              connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to
              other Amazon DocumentDB replicas in the cluster,  you  can  then
              reconnect to the reader endpoint.

          MultiAZ -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  the cluster has instances in multiple Avail-
              ability Zones.

              Contains the master user name for the cluster.

          PreferredBackupWindow -> (string)
              Specifies the daily time range during  which  automated  backups

              Specifies the weekly time range during which system  maintenance
              can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

          ReplicationSourceIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains the identifier of the source cluster if this cluster is
              a secondary cluster.

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the cluster.

          AssociatedRoles -> (list)
              Provides  a  list  of  the  Identity and Access Management (IAM)
              roles that are associated with the cluster. (IAM) roles that are
              associated  with  a  cluster grant permission for the cluster to
              access other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf.

              (structure)
                 Describes an Identity and Access Management (IAM)  role  that
                 is associated with a cluster.

                     o ACTIVE - The IAMrole ARN is associated with the cluster
                       and  can  be  used  to access other Amazon Web Services
                       services on your behalf.

                     o PENDING - The IAMrole ARN is being associated with  the
                       cluster.

                     o INVALID  - The IAMrole ARN is associated with the clus-
                       ter, but the cluster cannot assume the IAMrole  to  ac-
                       cess other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf.
