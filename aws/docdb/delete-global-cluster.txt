DELETE-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()                                DELETE-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()



NAME
       delete-global-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  global cluster. The primary and secondary clusters must al-
       ready be detached or deleted before attempting to delete a global clus-
       ter.

       NOTE:
          This action only applies to Amazon DocumentDB clusters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-global-cluster
          --global-cluster-identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-cluster-identifier (string)
          The cluster identifier of the global cluster being deleted.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GlobalCluster -> (structure)
          A data type representing an Amazon DocumentDB global cluster.

          GlobalClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains a user-supplied global cluster identifier. This identi-
              fier is the unique key that identifies a global cluster.

          GlobalClusterResourceId -> (string)
              The  Amazon Web Services Region-unique, immutable identifier for
              the global database cluster. This identifier  is  found  in  AWS
              CloudTrail  log entries whenever the AWS KMS customer master key
              (CMK) for the cluster is accessed.

          GlobalClusterArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the global cluster.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this global cluster.

          Engine -> (string)
              The Amazon DocumentDB database engine used by the  global  clus-
              ter.

          EngineVersion -> (string)
              Indicates the database engine version.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              The default database name within the new global cluster.

          StorageEncrypted -> (boolean)
              The storage encryption setting for the global cluster.

          DeletionProtection -> (boolean)
              The deletion protection setting for the new global cluster.

          GlobalClusterMembers -> (list)
              The list of cluster IDs for secondary clusters within the global
              cluster. Currently limited to one item.

              (structure)
                 A data structure with information about any primary and  sec-
                 ondary  clusters  associated with an Amazon DocumentDB global
                 clusters.

                 DBClusterArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for each Amazon DocumentDB
                     cluster.

                 Readers -> (list)
                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) for each read-only sec-
                     ondary cluster associated with the Aurora global cluster.

                     (string)

                 IsWriter -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether the Amazon DocumentDB  cluster  is  the
                     primary  cluster (that is, has read-write capability) for
                     the Amazon DocumentDB global cluster with which it is as-
                     sociated.
