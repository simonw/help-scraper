DESCRIBE-PENDING-MAINTENANCE-ACTIONS()  DESCRIBE-PENDING-MAINTENANCE-ACTIONS()



NAME
       describe-pending-maintenance-actions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of resources (for example, instances) that have at least
       one pending maintenance action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-pending-maintenance-actions is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: PendingMaintenanceActions

SYNOPSIS
            describe-pending-maintenance-actions
          [--resource-identifier <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-identifier (string)
          The ARN of a resource to return pending maintenance actions for.

       --filters (list)
          A  filter  that  specifies  one  or more resources to return pending
          maintenance actions for.

          Supported filters:

          o db-cluster-id - Accepts cluster identifiers and cluster Amazon Re-
            source  Names (ARNs). The results list includes only pending main-
            tenance actions for the clusters identified by these ARNs.

          o db-instance-id - Accepts instance identifiers and  instance  ARNs.
            The results list includes only pending maintenance actions for the
            DB instances identified by these ARNs.

          (structure)
              A named set of filter values, used to  return  a  more  specific
              list  of  results.  You  can  use a filter to match a set of re-
              sources by specific criteria, such as IDs.

              Wildcards are not supported in filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

              ResourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource that has pend-
                 ing maintenance actions.

              PendingMaintenanceActionDetails -> (list)

                 actions for the resource.

                 (structure)
                     Provides  information  about a pending maintenance action
                     for a resource.

                     Action -> (string)
                        The type of pending maintenance action that is  avail-
                        able for the resource.

                     AutoAppliedAfterDate -> (timestamp)
                        The  date of the maintenance window when the action is
                        applied. The maintenance action is applied to the  re-
                        source  during its first maintenance window after this
                        date. If this date is specified, any  next-maintenance
                        opt-in requests are ignored.

                     ForcedApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                        The  date when the maintenance action is automatically
                        applied. The maintenance action is applied to the  re-
                        source on this date regardless of the maintenance win-
                        dow for the resource. If this date is  specified,  any
                        immediate opt-in requests are ignored.

                     OptInStatus -> (string)
                        Indicates the type of opt-in request that has been re-
                        ceived for the resource.

                     CurrentApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                        The effective date when the pending maintenance action
                        is applied to the resource.

                     Description -> (string)
                        A  description providing more detail about the mainte-
                        nance action.

       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter  is  specified,  the response includes only records beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .
