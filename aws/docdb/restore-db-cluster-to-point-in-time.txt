RESTORE-DB-CLUSTER-TO-POINT-IN-TIME()    RESTORE-DB-CLUSTER-TO-POINT-IN-TIME()



NAME
       restore-db-cluster-to-point-in-time -

DESCRIPTION
       Restores  a cluster to an arbitrary point in time. Users can restore to
       any point in time before LatestRestorableTime for  up  to  BackupReten-
       tionPeriod  days. The target cluster is created from the source cluster
       with the same configuration as the original cluster,  except  that  the
       new cluster is created with the default security group.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       --vpc-security-group-ids (list)
          A list of VPC security groups that the new cluster belongs to.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          The tags to be assigned to the restored cluster.

          (structure)
              Metadata assigned to an Amazon DocumentDB resource consisting of
              a key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 The  required name of the tag. The string value can be from 1
                 to 128 Unicode characters in length  and  can't  be  prefixed
                 with  "aws: " or "rds: ". The string can contain only the set
                 of Unicode letters, digits, white space, '_', '.', '/',  '=',
                 '+', '-' (Java regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional value of the tag. The string value can be from 1
                 to 256 Unicode characters in length  and  can't  be  prefixed
                 with  "aws: " or "rds: ". The string can contain only the set
                 of Unicode letters, digits, white space, '_', '.', '/',  '=',
                 '+', '-' (Java regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The  KMS  key  identifier to use when restoring an encrypted cluster
          from an encrypted cluster.

          The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS
          encryption key. If you are restoring a cluster with the same account
          that owns the KMS encryption key used to encrypt  the  new  cluster,
          then  you  can  use the KMS key alias instead of the ARN for the KMS
          encryption key.

          You can restore to a new cluster and encrypt the new cluster with an
          KMS  key  that  is  different  from  the KMS key used to encrypt the
          source cluster. The new DB cluster is encrypted  with  the  KMS  key
          identified by the KmsKeyId parameter.

          If  you  do not specify a value for the KmsKeyId parameter, then the
          following occurs:

          o If the cluster is encrypted, then  the  restored  cluster  is  en-
            crypted  using  the  KMS  key  that was used to encrypt the source
            cluster.

          o If the cluster is not encrypted, then the restored cluster is  not
            encrypted.

          If  DBClusterIdentifier  refers  to a cluster that is not encrypted,
          then the restore request is rejected.

       --enable-cloudwatch-logs-exports (list)
          A list of log types that must be enabled  for  exporting  to  Amazon
          CloudWatch Logs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          Specifies whether this cluster can be deleted. If DeletionProtection
          is enabled, the cluster cannot be deleted unless it is modified  and
          DeletionProtection is disabled. DeletionProtection protects clusters
          from being accidentally deleted.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To restore an Amazon DocumentDB cluster to a point-in-time from a  man-
       ual snapshot

       The following restore-db-cluster-to-point-in-time example uses the sam-
       ple-cluster-snapshot to create a new Amazon  DocumentDB  cluster,  sam-
       ple-cluster-pit, using the latest restorable time.

OUTPUT
       DBCluster -> (structure)
          Detailed information about a cluster.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides the list of Amazon  EC2  Availability  Zones  that  in-
              stances in the cluster can be created in.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              Specifies  the  number of days for which automatic snapshots are
              retained.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains a user-supplied cluster identifier. This identifier  is
              the unique key that identifies a cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              Specifies  the name of the cluster parameter group for the clus-
              ter.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Specifies information on the subnet  group  that  is  associated
              with  the  cluster, including the name, description, and subnets
              in the subnet group.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this cluster.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

          EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              The earliest time to which  a  database  can  be  restored  with
              point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              Specifies  the  connection  endpoint for the primary instance of
              the cluster.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The reader endpoint for the cluster. The reader endpoint  for  a
              cluster  load  balances connections across the Amazon DocumentDB
              replicas that are available in a cluster. As clients request new
              connections  to  the reader endpoint, Amazon DocumentDB distrib-
              utes the connection requests among the Amazon DocumentDB  repli-
              cas  in  the  cluster.  This functionality can help balance your
              read workload across multiple Amazon DocumentDB replicas in your
              cluster.

              If a failover occurs, and the Amazon DocumentDB replica that you
              are connected to is promoted to be the  primary  instance,  your
              connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to
              other Amazon DocumentDB replicas in the cluster,  you  can  then
              reconnect to the reader endpoint.

          MultiAZ -> (boolean)

              Contains the master user name for the cluster.

          PreferredBackupWindow -> (string)
              Specifies the daily time range during  which  automated  backups
              are  created  if automated backups are enabled, as determined by
              the BackupRetentionPeriod .

              Specifies the weekly time range during which system  maintenance
              can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

          ReplicationSourceIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains the identifier of the source cluster if this cluster is
              a secondary cluster.

          ReadReplicaIdentifiers -> (list)
              Contains one or more identifiers of the secondary clusters  that
              are associated with this cluster.

              (string)

          DBClusterMembers -> (list)
              Provides the list of instances that make up the cluster.

              (structure)

                     A value that specifies the order in which an Amazon Docu-
                     mentDB replica is promoted to the primary instance  after
                     a failure of the existing primary instance.

          VpcSecurityGroups -> (list)
              Provides  a  list of virtual private cloud (VPC) security groups
              that the cluster belongs to.

              key for the cluster is accessed.

          DBClusterArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the cluster.

          AssociatedRoles -> (list)
              Provides  a  list  of  the  Identity and Access Management (IAM)
              roles that are associated with the cluster. (IAM) roles that are
              associated  with  a  cluster grant permission for the cluster to
              access other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf.

              (structure)
                 Describes an Identity and Access Management (IAM)  role  that
                 is associated with a cluster.

                 RoleArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAMrole that is as-
                     sociated with the DB cluster.

                     Describes the state of association  between  the  IAMrole
                     and  the  cluster. The Status property returns one of the
                     following values:

                     o ACTIVE - The IAMrole ARN is associated with the cluster
                       and  can  be  used  to access other Amazon Web Services
                       services on your behalf.

                     o PENDING - The IAMrole ARN is being associated with  the
                       cluster.

                     o INVALID  - The IAMrole ARN is associated with the clus-
                       ter, but the cluster cannot assume the IAMrole  to  ac-
                       cess other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf.
