NAME
       apply-pending-maintenance-action -

DESCRIPTION
       Applies  a pending maintenance action to a resource (for example, to an
       Amazon DocumentDB instance).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            apply-pending-maintenance-action
          --resource-identifier <value>
          --apply-action <value>
          --opt-in-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-identifier (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  resource  that  the  pending
          maintenance action applies to.

       --apply-action (string)
          The pending maintenance action to apply to this resource.

          Valid values: system-update , db-upgrade

       --opt-in-type (string)
          A  value  that  specifies  the  type  of opt-in request or undoes an
          opt-in request. An opt-in request of type immediate can't be undone.

          Valid values:

          o immediate - Apply the maintenance action immediately.

          o next-maintenance - Apply the maintenance action  during  the  next
            maintenance window for the resource.

          o undo-opt-in  -  Cancel  any  existing  next-maintenance opt-in re-
            quests.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  have pending maintenance actions take place during the next mainte-
       nance window

       The following apply-pending-maintenance-action example causes all  sys-
       tem-update  actions  to  be performed during the next scheduled mainte-
       nance window.

          aws docdb apply-pending-maintenance-action \
          --resource-identifier arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster:sample-cluster \
          --apply-action system-update \
          --opt-in-type next-maintenance

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see Applying Amazon  DocumentDB  Updates  in  the
       Amazon DocumentDB Developer Guide.

              maintenance actions.

          PendingMaintenanceActionDetails -> (list)
              A list that provides details about the pending  maintenance  ac-
              tions for the resource.

              (structure)
                 Provides information about a pending maintenance action for a
                 resource.

                 Action -> (string)
                     The type of pending maintenance action that is  available
                     for the resource.

                 AutoAppliedAfterDate -> (timestamp)
                     The date of the maintenance window when the action is ap-
                     plied. The maintenance action is applied to the  resource
                     during  its  first maintenance window after this date. If
                     this date is specified, any next-maintenance  opt-in  re-
                     quests are ignored.

                 ForcedApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                     The date when the maintenance action is automatically ap-
                     plied. The maintenance action is applied to the  resource
                     on this date regardless of the maintenance window for the
                     resource. If this date is specified, any immediate opt-in
                     requests are ignored.

                 OptInStatus -> (string)
                     Indicates  the  type  of opt-in request that has been re-

                 CurrentApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                     The effective date when the pending maintenance action is
                     applied to the resource.

                 Description -> (string)
                     A description providing more detail about the maintenance
                     action.
