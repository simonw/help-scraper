OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  cluster identifier for the cluster that is being modified. This
          parameter is not case sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing DBCluster .

       --new-db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The new cluster identifier for the cluster when renaming a  cluster.
          This value is stored as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o The first character must be a letter.

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          Example: my-cluster2

       --apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately (boolean)
          A  value  that specifies whether the changes in this request and any
          pending changes are asynchronously applied as soon as possible,  re-
          gardless  of the PreferredMaintenanceWindow setting for the cluster.
          If this parameter is set to false , changes to the cluster  are  ap-
          plied during the next maintenance window.

          The  ApplyImmediately parameter affects only the NewDBClusterIdenti-
          fier and MasterUserPassword values. If you set this parameter  value
          to false , the changes to the NewDBClusterIdentifier and MasterUser-
          Password values are applied during the next maintenance window.  All
          other  changes  are  applied immediately, regardless of the value of
          the ApplyImmediately parameter.

          Default: false

       --backup-retention-period (integer)
          The number of days for which automated  backups  are  retained.  You
          must specify a minimum value of 1.

          Default: 1

          Constraints:

          o Must be a value from 1 to 35.

          Default: The same port as the original cluster.

       --master-user-password (string)
          The password for the master database user. This password can contain
          any printable ASCII character except forward slash (/), double quote
          ("), or the "at" symbol (@).

          Constraints: Must contain from 8 to 100 characters.

       --preferred-backup-window (string)
          The daily time range during which automated backups are  created  if
          automated  backups  are enabled, using the BackupRetentionPeriod pa-
          rameter.

          Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

          Format: ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi

          The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an  8-hour
          block  of  time  for each Amazon Web Services Region, occurring on a
          random day of the week.

          Valid days: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun

          exported (or not exported) to CloudWatch Logs.

          EnableLogTypes -> (list)
              The list of log types to enable.

              (string)

          DisableLogTypes -> (list)
              The list of log types to disable.

       --engine-version (string)
          The  version  number of the database engine to which you want to up-
          grade. Modifying engine version is not  supported  on  Amazon  Docu-
          mentDB.

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          Specifies whether this cluster can be deleted. If DeletionProtection
          is enabled, the cluster cannot be deleted unless it is modified  and
          DeletionProtection is disabled. DeletionProtection protects clusters
          from being accidentally deleted.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To modify an Amazon DocumentDB cluster

       The  following modify-db-cluster example modifies the Amazon DocumentDB
       cluster sample-cluster by making the  retention  period  for  automatic
       backups 7 days, and changing the preferred windows for both backups and
       maintenance. All changes are applied at the next maintenance window.

OUTPUT
       DBCluster -> (structure)
          Detailed information about a cluster.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides  the  list  of  Amazon  EC2 Availability Zones that in-
              stances in the cluster can be created in.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              Specifies the number of days for which automatic  snapshots  are
              retained.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains  a user-supplied cluster identifier. This identifier is
              the unique key that identifies a cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              Specifies the name of the cluster parameter group for the  clus-
              ter.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Specifies  information  on  the  subnet group that is associated
              with the cluster, including the name, description,  and  subnets
              in the subnet group.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this cluster.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

          EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              The  earliest  time  to  which  a  database can be restored with
              point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              Specifies the connection endpoint for the  primary  instance  of
              the cluster.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The  reader  endpoint for the cluster. The reader endpoint for a
              cluster load balances connections across the  Amazon  DocumentDB
              replicas that are available in a cluster. As clients request new
              connections to the reader endpoint, Amazon  DocumentDB  distrib-
              utes  the connection requests among the Amazon DocumentDB repli-
              cas in the cluster. This functionality  can  help  balance  your
              read workload across multiple Amazon DocumentDB replicas in your
              cluster.

              If a failover occurs, and the Amazon DocumentDB replica that you
              are  connected  to  is promoted to be the primary instance, your
              connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to
              other  Amazon  DocumentDB  replicas in the cluster, you can then
              reconnect to the reader endpoint.

          MultiAZ -> (boolean)

              Contains the master user name for the cluster.

          PreferredBackupWindow -> (string)
              Specifies  the  daily  time range during which automated backups
              are created if automated backups are enabled, as  determined  by
              the BackupRetentionPeriod .

          PreferredMaintenanceWindow -> (string)
              Specifies  the weekly time range during which system maintenance
              can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

          ReplicationSourceIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains the identifier of the source cluster if this cluster is
              a secondary cluster.

          ReadReplicaIdentifiers -> (list)
              Contains  one or more identifiers of the secondary clusters that
              are associated with this cluster.

              (string)

          DBClusterMembers -> (list)
              Provides the list of instances that make up the cluster.

              (structure)
                 Contains information about an instance  that  is  part  of  a
                 cluster.

                 DBInstanceIdentifier -> (string)
                     Specifies  the instance identifier for this member of the
                     cluster.

                 IsClusterWriter -> (boolean)
                     A value that is true if the cluster member is the primary
                     instance for the cluster and false otherwise.

                 DBClusterParameterGroupStatus -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  status of the cluster parameter group for
                     this member of the DB cluster.

                 PromotionTier -> (integer)
                     A value that specifies the order in which an Amazon Docu-
                     mentDB  replica is promoted to the primary instance after
                     a failure of the existing primary instance.

          VpcSecurityGroups -> (list)
              Provides a list of virtual private cloud (VPC)  security  groups
              that the cluster belongs to.

              (structure)
                 Used  as  a  response  element for queries on virtual private
                 cloud (VPC) security group membership.

              Provides a list of the  Identity  and  Access  Management  (IAM)
              roles that are associated with the cluster. (IAM) roles that are
              associated with a cluster grant permission for  the  cluster  to
              access other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf.

              (structure)
                 Describes  an  Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that
                 is associated with a cluster.

                 RoleArn -> (string)
