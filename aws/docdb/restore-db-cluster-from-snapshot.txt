RESTORE-DB-CLUSTER-FROM-SNAPSHOT()          RESTORE-DB-CLUSTER-FROM-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       restore-db-cluster-from-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new cluster from a snapshot or cluster snapshot.

       If  a  snapshot  is  specified,  the target cluster is created from the
       source DB snapshot with a default configuration  and  default  security
       group.

       If  a cluster snapshot is specified, the target cluster is created from
       the source cluster restore point with the  same  configuration  as  the
       original source DB cluster, except that the new cluster is created with
       the default security group.

OPTIONS
       --availability-zones (list)
          Provides the list of Amazon EC2 Availability Zones that instances in
          the restored DB cluster can be created in.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The name of the cluster to create from the snapshot or cluster snap-
          shot. This parameter isn't case sensitive.

          Constraints:

       --snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier for the snapshot or cluster snapshot to restore from.

          You can use either the name or the Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  to
          specify  a  cluster  snapshot.  However, you can use only the ARN to
          specify a snapshot.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing snapshot.

       --engine (string)
          The database engine to use for the new cluster.

          Constraint: Must be compatible with the engine of the source.

       --engine-version (string)
          The version of the database engine to use for the new cluster.

       --port (integer)
          The port number on which the new cluster accepts connections.

          Constraints: Must be a value from 1150 to 65535 .

          Default: The same port as the original cluster.

       --db-subnet-group-name (string)

          Constraints: If provided, must match the name of an existing  DBSub-
          netGroup .

          Example: mySubnetgroup

       --vpc-security-group-ids (list)
          A  list  of virtual private cloud (VPC) security groups that the new
          cluster will belong to.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          The tags to be assigned to the restored cluster.

          (structure)
              Metadata assigned to an Amazon DocumentDB resource consisting of
              a key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 The  required name of the tag. The string value can be from 1
                 to 128 Unicode characters in length  and  can't  be  prefixed
                 with  "aws: " or "rds: ". The string can contain only the set
                 of Unicode letters, digits, white space, '_', '.', '/',  '=',
                 '+', '-' (Java regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional value of the tag. The string value can be from 1
                 to 256 Unicode characters in length  and  can't  be  prefixed
                 with  "aws: " or "rds: ". The string can contain only the set
                 of Unicode letters, digits, white space, '_', '.', '/',  '=',
                 '+', '-' (Java regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The  KMS  key  identifier to use when restoring an encrypted cluster
          from a DB snapshot or cluster snapshot.

          The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS
          encryption  key. If you are restoring a cluster with the same Amazon
          Web Services account that owns the KMS encryption key  used  to  en-
          crypt the new cluster, then you can use the KMS key alias instead of
          the ARN for the KMS encryption key.

          If you do not specify a value for the KmsKeyId parameter,  then  the
          following occurs:

          o If  the  snapshot or cluster snapshot in SnapshotIdentifier is en-
            crypted, then the restored cluster is encrypted using the KMS  key
            that was used to encrypt the snapshot or the cluster snapshot.

          o If  the  snapshot or the cluster snapshot in SnapshotIdentifier is
            not encrypted, then the restored DB cluster is not encrypted.

       --enable-cloudwatch-logs-exports (list)
          A list of log types that must be enabled  for  exporting  to  Amazon
          CloudWatch Logs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          Specifies whether this cluster can be deleted. If DeletionProtection
          is enabled, the cluster cannot be deleted unless it is modified  and
          DeletionProtection is disabled. DeletionProtection protects clusters
          from being accidentally deleted.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI

OUTPUT
       DBCluster -> (structure)
          Detailed information about a cluster.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides the list of Amazon  EC2  Availability  Zones  that  in-
              stances in the cluster can be created in.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              Specifies  the  number of days for which automatic snapshots are
              retained.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains a user-supplied cluster identifier. This identifier  is
              the unique key that identifies a cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              Specifies  the name of the cluster parameter group for the clus-
              ter.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Specifies information on the subnet  group  that  is  associated
              with  the  cluster, including the name, description, and subnets
              in the subnet group.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this cluster.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

          EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              The earliest time to which  a  database  can  be  restored  with
              point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              Specifies  the  connection  endpoint for the primary instance of
              the cluster.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The reader endpoint for the cluster. The reader endpoint  for  a
              cluster  load  balances connections across the Amazon DocumentDB
              replicas that are available in a cluster. As clients request new
              connections  to  the reader endpoint, Amazon DocumentDB distrib-
              utes the connection requests among the Amazon DocumentDB  repli-
              cas  in  the  cluster.  This functionality can help balance your
              read workload across multiple Amazon DocumentDB replicas in your
              cluster.

              If a failover occurs, and the Amazon DocumentDB replica that you
              are connected to is promoted to be the  primary  instance,  your
              connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to
              other Amazon DocumentDB replicas in the cluster,  you  can  then
              reconnect to the reader endpoint.

          MultiAZ -> (boolean)

              Specifies  the  latest  time to which a database can be restored
              with point-in-time restore.

          Port -> (integer)
              Specifies the port that the database engine is listening on.

          MasterUsername -> (string)
              Contains the master user name for the cluster.

          PreferredBackupWindow -> (string)
              Specifies the daily time range during  which  automated  backups
              are  created  if automated backups are enabled, as determined by
              the BackupRetentionPeriod .

          PreferredMaintenanceWindow -> (string)
              Specifies the weekly time range during which system  maintenance
              can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

          ReplicationSourceIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains the identifier of the source cluster if this cluster is
              a secondary cluster.

          ReadReplicaIdentifiers -> (list)
              Contains one or more identifiers of the secondary clusters  that
              are associated with this cluster.

              (string)

          DBClusterMembers -> (list)
              Provides the list of instances that make up the cluster.

              (structure)
                 Contains  information  about  an  instance  that is part of a
                 cluster.

                 DBInstanceIdentifier -> (string)
                     Specifies the instance identifier for this member of  the
                     cluster.

                 IsClusterWriter -> (boolean)
                     A value that is true if the cluster member is the primary
                     instance for the cluster and false otherwise.

                 DBClusterParameterGroupStatus -> (string)
                     Specifies the status of the cluster parameter  group  for
                     this member of the DB cluster.

                 PromotionTier -> (integer)
                     A value that specifies the order in which an Amazon Docu-
                     mentDB replica is promoted to the primary instance  after
                     a failure of the existing primary instance.

          VpcSecurityGroups -> (list)
              Provides  a  list of virtual private cloud (VPC) security groups
              that the cluster belongs to.

              (structure)
                 Used as a response element for  queries  on  virtual  private
                 cloud (VPC) security group membership.

              Provides  a  list  of  the  Identity and Access Management (IAM)
              roles that are associated with the cluster. (IAM) roles that are
              associated  with  a  cluster grant permission for the cluster to
              access other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf.

              (structure)
                 Describes an Identity and Access Management (IAM)  role  that
                 is associated with a cluster.

                 RoleArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAMrole that is as-
                     sociated with the DB cluster.

                 Status -> (string)
                     Describes the state of association  between  the  IAMrole
                     and  the  cluster. The Status property returns one of the
                     following values:

                     o ACTIVE - The IAMrole ARN is associated with the cluster
                       and  can  be  used  to access other Amazon Web Services
                       services on your behalf.

                     o PENDING - The IAMrole ARN is being associated with  the
                       cluster.

                     o INVALID  - The IAMrole ARN is associated with the clus-
                       ter, but the cluster cannot assume the IAMrole  to  ac-
                       cess other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf.

          CloneGroupId -> (string)
              Identifies  the  clone  group to which the DB cluster is associ-
              ated.

          ClusterCreateTime -> (timestamp)
              Specifies the time when the cluster was  created,  in  Universal
              Coordinated Time (UTC).

          EnabledCloudwatchLogsExports -> (list)
              A list of log types that this cluster is configured to export to
              Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

              (string)

          DeletionProtection -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether this cluster can be deleted.  If  DeletionPro-
              tection  is  enabled, the cluster cannot be deleted unless it is
              modified and DeletionProtection is disabled.  DeletionProtection
              protects clusters from being accidentally deleted.
