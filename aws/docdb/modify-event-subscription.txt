          --subscription-name <value>
          [--sns-topic-arn <value>]
          [--source-type <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subscription-name (string)
          The name of the Amazon DocumentDB event notification subscription.

       --sns-topic-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the SNS topic created for event
          notification. The ARN is created by Amazon SNS  when  you  create  a
          topic and subscribe to it.

       --source-type (string)
          The  type  of  source that is generating the events. For example, if
          you want to be notified of events generated by an instance, set this
          parameter  to  db-instance  .  If  this  value is not specified, all
          events are returned.

          Valid values: db-instance , db-parameter-group , db-security-group

       --event-categories (list)
          A list of event categories for a SourceType that you  want  to  sub-
          scribe to.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --enabled | --no-enabled (boolean)
          A Boolean value; set to true to activate the subscription.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
