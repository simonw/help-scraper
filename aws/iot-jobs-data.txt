NAME
       iot-jobs-data -

DESCRIPTION
       IoT  Jobs  is a service that allows you to define a set of jobs  remote
       operations that are sent to and executed on one or  more  devices  con-
       nected  to  Amazon Web Services IoT Core. For example, you can define a
       job that instructs a set of devices to download and install application
       or  firmware  updates,  reboot,  rotate certificates, or perform remote
       troubleshooting operations.

       Find the endpoint address for actions in the IoT  jobs  data  plane  by
       running this CLI command:
          aws iot describe-endpoint --endpoint-type iot:Jobs

       The  service  name  used  by Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4 to
       sign requests is: iot-jobs-data .

       To create a job, you make a job document which is a description of  the
       remote  operations  to  be performed, and you specify a list of targets
       that should perform the  operations.  The  targets  can  be  individual
       things, thing groups or both.

       IoT Jobs sends a message to inform the targets that a job is available.
       The target starts the execution of the job by downloading the job docu-
       ment,  performing  the  operations  it  specifies,  and  reporting  its
       progress to Amazon Web Services IoT Core.  The  Jobs  service  provides
       commands  to  track  the progress of a job on a specific target and for
       all the targets of the job
