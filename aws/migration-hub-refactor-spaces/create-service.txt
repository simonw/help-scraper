CREATE-SERVICE()                                              CREATE-SERVICE()



NAME
       create-service -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  Amazon Web Services Migration Hub Refactor Spaces service.
       The account owner of the service is always the environment  owner,  re-
       gardless  of which account in the environment creates the service. Ser-
       vices have either a URL endpoint in a virtual private cloud (VPC), or a
       Lambda function endpoint.

       WARNING:
          If  an Amazon Web Services resourceis launched in a service VPC, and
          you want it to be accessible to all of an environments services with
          VPCs  and  routes,  apply the RefactorSpacesSecurityGroup to the re-
          source. Alternatively, to add more cross-account constraints,  apply
          your own security group.

OPTIONS
       --application-identifier (string)
          The ID of the application which the service is created.

       --client-token (string)

          idempotency of the request.

       --description (string)
          The description of the service.

       --endpoint-type (string)
          The type of endpoint to use for the service. The type can be  a  URL
          in a VPC or an Lambda function.

          Possible values:

          o LAMBDA

          o URL

       --environment-identifier (string)
          The ID of the environment in which the service is created.

       --lambda-endpoint (structure)
          The configuration for the Lambda endpoint type.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lambda endpoint.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Arn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Arn": "string"
          }

       --name (string)
          The name of the service.

       --tags (map)
          The  tags to assign to the service. A tag is a label that you assign
          to an Amazon Web Services resource. Each tag consists of a key-value
          pair..

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --url-endpoint (structure)
          The configuration for the URL endpoint type.

          HealthUrl -> (string)
              The  health  check URL of the URL endpoint type. If the URL is a
              public endpoint, the HealthUrl must also be a  public  endpoint.
              If  the URL is a private endpoint inside a virtual private cloud
              (VPC), the health URL must also be a private endpoint,  and  the
              host must be the same as the URL.

          Url -> (string)
              The   URL   to   route   traffic   to.   The   URL  must  be  an
              rfc3986-formatted URL . If the host is a domain name,  the  name
              must  be  resolvable  over the public internet. If the scheme is
              https , the top level domain of the host must be listed  in  the
              IANA root zone database .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          HealthUrl=string,Url=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "HealthUrl": "string",
            "Url": "string"
          }

       --vpc-id (string)
          The ID of the VPC.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
