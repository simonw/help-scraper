CREATE-ROUTE()                                                  CREATE-ROUTE()



NAME
       create-route -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an Amazon Web Services Migration Hub Refactor Spaces route. The
       account owner of the service resource is always the environment  owner,
       regardless  of which account creates the route. Routes target a service
       in the application. If an application does not have  any  routes,  then
       the first route must be created as a DEFAULT  RouteType .

       When  you  create  a  route,  Refactor Spaces configures the Amazon API
       Gateway to send traffic to the target service as follows:

       o If the service has a URL endpoint, and the  endpoint  resolves  to  a
         private  IP  address,  Refactor  Spaces  routes traffic using the API
         Gateway VPC link.

       o If the service has a URL endpoint, and the  endpoint  resolves  to  a
         public IP address, Refactor Spaces routes traffic over the public in-
         ternet.

       o If the service has an Lambda function endpoint, then Refactor  Spaces
         uses the API Gateway Lambda integration.

       A  health  check is performed on the service when the route is created.
       If the health check fails, the route transitions to  FAILED  ,  and  no
       traffic is sent to the service.

       For  Lambda  functions,  the  Lambda  function state is checked. If the
       function is not active, the function configuration is updated  so  that
       Lambda  resources are provisioned. If the Lambda state is Failed , then
       the   route   creation   fails.   For   more   information,   see   the
       GetFunctionConfiguration's  State  response parameter in the Lambda De-
       veloper Guide .

       For public URLs, a connection is opened to the public endpoint. If  the
       URL  is not reachable, the health check fails. For private URLs, a tar-
       get group is created and the target group health check is run.

       The HealthCheckProtocol , HealthCheckPort , and HealthCheckPath are the
       same  protocol,  port,  and path specified in the URL or health URL, if
       used. All other settings use the default values, as described in Health
       checks for your target groups . The health check is considered success-
       ful if at least one target within the target  group  transitions  to  a
       healthy state.

SYNOPSIS
            create-route
          --application-identifier <value>
          [--client-token <value>]
          --environment-identifier <value>
          --route-type <value>
          --service-identifier <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--uri-path-route <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-identifier (string)
          The ID of the application within which the route is being created.

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request.

       --environment-identifier (string)
          The ID of the environment in which the route is created.

       --route-type (string)
          The route type of the route. DEFAULT indicates that all traffic that
          does  not match another route is forwarded to the default route. Ap-
          plications must have a default route before any other routes can  be
          created. URI_PATH indicates a route that is based on a URI path.

          Possible values:

          o DEFAULT

          o URI_PATH

       --service-identifier (string)
          The  ID  of  the service in which the route is created. Traffic that
          matches this route is forwarded to this service.

       --tags (map)
          The tags to assign to the route. A tag is a label that you assign to
          an  Amazon  Web  Services resource. Each tag consists of a key-value
          pair..

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --uri-path-route (structure)
          The configuration for the URI path route type.

          ActivationState -> (string)
              Indicates whether traffic is forwarded to  this  routes  service
              after the route is created.

          IncludeChildPaths -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether  to  match  all  subpaths of the given source
              path. If this value is false , requests must  match  the  source
              path exactly before they are forwarded to this route's service.

          Methods -> (list)
              A  list of HTTP methods to match. An empty list matches all val-
              ues. If a method is  present,  only  HTTP  requests  using  that
              method are forwarded to this routes service.

              (string)

          SourcePath -> (string)
              The  path  to  use to match traffic. Paths must start with / and
              are relative to the base of the application.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ActivationState=string,IncludeChildPaths=boolean,Methods=string,string,SourcePath=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ActivationState": "ACTIVE",
            "IncludeChildPaths": true|false,
            "Methods": ["DELETE"|"GET"|"HEAD"|"OPTIONS"|"PATCH"|"POST"|"PUT", ...],
            "SourcePath": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
