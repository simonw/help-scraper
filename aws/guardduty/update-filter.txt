       Shorthand Syntax:

          Criterion={KeyName1={Eq=[string,string],Neq=[string,string],Gt=integer,Gte=integer,Lt=integer,Lte=integer,Equals=[string,string],NotEquals=[string,string],GreaterThan=long,GreaterThanOrEqual=long,LessThan=long,LessThanOrEqual=long},KeyName2={Eq=[string,string],Neq=[string,string],Gt=integer,Gte=integer,Lt=integer,Lte=integer,Equals=[string,string],NotEquals=[string,string],GreaterThan=long,GreaterThanOrEqual=long,LessThan=long,LessThanOrEqual=long}}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Criterion": {"string": {
                  "Eq": ["string", ...],
                  "Neq": ["string", ...],
                  "Gt": integer,
                  "Gte": integer,
                  "Lt": integer,
                  "Lte": integer,
                  "Equals": ["string", ...],
                  "NotEquals": ["string", ...],
                  "GreaterThan": long,
                  "GreaterThanOrEqual": long,
                  "LessThan": long,
                  "LessThanOrEqual": long
                }
              ...}
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Name -> (string)
          The name of the filter.
