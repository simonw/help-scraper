NAME
       get-findings -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes Amazon GuardDuty findings specified by finding IDs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-findings
          --detector-id <value>
          --finding-ids <value>
          [--sort-criteria <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --detector-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the detector that specifies the GuardDuty service whose
          findings you want to retrieve.

       --finding-ids (list)
          The IDs of the findings that you want to retrieve.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --sort-criteria (structure)
          Represents the criteria used for sorting findings.

          AttributeName -> (string)
              Represents the finding attribute  (for  example,  accountId)  to
              sort findings by.

          OrderBy -> (string)
              The order by which the sorted findings are to be displayed.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AttributeName=string,OrderBy=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AttributeName": "string",
            "OrderBy": "ASC"|"DESC"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To retrieve the details of a specific finding

       The following get-findings example retrieves the full JSON finding  de-
       tails of the specified finding.
