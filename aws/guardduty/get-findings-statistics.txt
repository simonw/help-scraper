       Shorthand Syntax:

          Criterion={KeyName1={Eq=[string,string],Neq=[string,string],Gt=integer,Gte=integer,Lt=integer,Lte=integer,Equals=[string,string],NotEquals=[string,string],GreaterThan=long,GreaterThanOrEqual=long,LessThan=long,LessThanOrEqual=long},KeyName2={Eq=[string,string],Neq=[string,string],Gt=integer,Gte=integer,Lt=integer,Lte=integer,Equals=[string,string],NotEquals=[string,string],GreaterThan=long,GreaterThanOrEqual=long,LessThan=long,LessThanOrEqual=long}}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Criterion": {"string": {
                  "Eq": ["string", ...],
                  "Neq": ["string", ...],
                  "Gt": integer,
                  "Gte": integer,
                  "Lt": integer,
                  "Lte": integer,
                  "Equals": ["string", ...],
                  "NotEquals": ["string", ...],
                  "GreaterThan": long,
                  "GreaterThanOrEqual": long,
                  "LessThan": long,
                  "LessThanOrEqual": long
                }
              ...}
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FindingStatistics -> (structure)

          CountBySeverity -> (map)
              Represents a map of severity to count statistics for  a  set  of
              findings.

              key -> (string)
