CREATE-MEMBERS()                                              CREATE-MEMBERS()



NAME
       create-members -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  member  accounts of the current Amazon Web Services account by
       specifying a list of Amazon Web Services account IDs. This  step  is  a
       prerequisite  for managing the associated member accounts either by in-
       vitation or through an organization.

       When using Create Members as an organizations  delegated  administrator
       this  action  will  enable GuardDuty in the added member accounts, with
       the exception of  the  organization  delegated  administrator  account,
       which must enable GuardDuty prior to being added as a member.

       If  you  are adding accounts by invitation use this action after Guard-
       Duty has been enabled in potential member accounts and before  using  `
       Invite                                                          Members

OPTIONS
       --detector-id (string)
          The unique ID of the detector of the GuardDuty account that you want
          to associate member accounts with.

       --account-details (list)
          A list of account ID and email address pairs of  the  accounts  that
          you want to associate with the GuardDuty administrator account.

          (structure)
              Contains information about the account.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The member account ID.

              Email -> (string)
                 The email address of the member account.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AccountId=string,Email=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "AccountId": "string",
              "Email": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
