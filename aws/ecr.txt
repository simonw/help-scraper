DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Elastic  Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a managed container
       image registry service. Customers can use the familiar Docker  CLI,  or
       their  preferred  client,  to push, pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR
       provides a secure, scalable, and reliable registry for your  Docker  or
       Open  Container  Initiative  (OCI)  images. Amazon ECR supports private
       repositories with resource-based permissions using IAM so that specific
       users or Amazon EC2 instances can access repositories and images.

       Amazon ECR has service endpoints in each supported Region. For more in-
       formation, see Amazon ECR endpoints in the Amazon Web Services  General
       Reference .
