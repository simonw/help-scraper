       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-host
          --host-arn <value>
          [--provider-endpoint <value>]
          [--vpc-configuration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --host-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the host to be updated.

       --provider-endpoint (string)
          The URL or endpoint of the host to be updated.

       --vpc-configuration (structure)
          The  VPC configuration of the host to be updated. A VPC must be con-
          figured and the infrastructure to be represented by  the  host  must
          already be connected to the VPC.

          VpcId -> (string)
              The  ID  of the Amazon VPC connected to the infrastructure where
              your provider type is installed.

          SubnetIds -> (list)
              The ID of the subnet or subnets associated with the  Amazon  VPC
              connected  to the infrastructure where your provider type is in-
              stalled.

              (string)

          SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              The ID of the security group or security groups associated  with
              the  Amazon  VPC  connected  to  the  infrastructure  where your
              provider type is installed.

              (string)

          TlsCertificate -> (string)
              The value of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate  as-
              sociated with the infrastructure where your provider type is in-
              stalled.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          VpcId=string,SubnetIds=string,string,SecurityGroupIds=string,string,TlsCertificate=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "VpcId": "string",
            "SubnetIds": ["string", ...],
            "SecurityGroupIds": ["string", ...],
            "TlsCertificate": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
