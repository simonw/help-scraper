LIST-HOSTS()                                                      LIST-HOSTS()



NAME
       list-hosts -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the hosts associated with your account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-hosts
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  results to return in a single call. To re-
          trieve the remaining results, make another call  with  the  returned
          nextToken value.

       --next-token (string)
          The  token that was returned from the previous ListHosts call, which
          can be used to return the next set of hosts in the list.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list hosts

       The following list-hosts example retrieves a list of all hosts in  your
       account.

          aws codestar-connections list-hosts

       Output:

          {
              "Hosts": [
                  {
                      "Name": "My-Host",
                      "HostArn": "arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-east-1:123456789012:host/My-Host-28aef605",
                      "ProviderType": "GitHubEnterpriseServer",
                      "ProviderEndpoint": "https://my-instance.test.dev",
                      "Status": "AVAILABLE"
                  }
              ]
          }

       sole User Guide.

OUTPUT
       Hosts -> (list)
          A list of hosts and the details for each host, such as status,  end-
          point, and provider type.

          (structure)
              A   resource   that   represents   the  infrastructure  where  a
              third-party provider is installed. The host  is  used  when  you
              create  connections  to  an installed third-party provider type,
              such as GitHub Enterprise Server. You create one  host  for  all
              connections to that provider.

              NOTE:
                 A  host created through the CLI or the SDK is in PENDING sta-
                 tus by default. You can make its status AVAILABLE by  setting
                 up the host in the console.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the host.

              HostArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the host.

              ProviderType -> (string)
                 The name of the installed provider to be associated with your
                 connection. The host resource represents  the  infrastructure
                 where  your  provider  type  is installed. The valid provider
                 type is GitHub Enterprise Server.

              ProviderEndpoint -> (string)
                 The endpoint of the infrastructure where your  provider  type
                 is installed.

              VpcConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The VPC configuration provisioned for the host.

                 VpcId -> (string)
                     The  ID of the Amazon VPC connected to the infrastructure
                     where your provider type is installed.

                 SubnetIds -> (list)
                     The ID of the subnet or subnets associated with the  Ama-
                     zon  VPC  connected  to  the  infrastructure  where  your
                     provider type is installed.

                     (string)

                 SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                     The ID of the security group or security  groups  associ-
                     ated  with the Amazon VPC connected to the infrastructure
                     where your provider type is installed.

                     (string)

                 TlsCertificate -> (string)
                     The value of the Transport Layer Security (TLS)  certifi-
                     cate   associated  with  the  infrastructure  where  your
                     provider type is installed.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the host, such as PENDING, AVAILABLE,  VPC_CON-
                 FIG_DELETING,     VPC_CONFIG_INITIALIZING,    and    VPC_CON-
                 FIG_FAILED_INITIALIZATION.

              StatusMessage -> (string)
                 The status description for the host.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that can be used in the next ListHosts  call.  To  view  all
          items  in the list, continue to call this operation with each subse-
          quent token until no more nextToken values are returned.
