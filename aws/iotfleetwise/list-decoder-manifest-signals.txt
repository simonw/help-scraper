NAME
       list-decoder-manifest-signals -

DESCRIPTION
       A list of information about signal decoders specified in a decoder man-
       ifest.

       NOTE:
          This API operation uses pagination. Specify the nextToken  parameter
          in the request to return more results.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-decoder-manifest-signals  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: signalDecoders

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the decoder manifest to list information about.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       signalDecoders -> (list)
          Information about a list of signals to decode.

          (structure)
              Information about a signal decoder.

              fullyQualifiedName -> (string)
                 The fully qualified name of a signal decoder as defined in  a
                 vehicle model.

              type -> (string)
                 The network protocol for the vehicle. For example, CAN_SIGNAL
                 specifies a protocol that defines how  data  is  communicated
                 between electronic control units (ECUs). OBD_SIGNAL specifies
                 a protocol that defines how self-diagnostic data is  communi-
                 cated between ECUs.

              interfaceId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of  a  network interface that specifies what network
                 protocol a vehicle follows.

              canSignal -> (structure)
                 Information about signal decoder using  the  Controller  Area
                 Network (CAN) protocol.

                 messageId -> (integer)
                     The ID of the message.

                 isBigEndian -> (boolean)
                     Whether the byte ordering of a CAN message is big-endian.

                 isSigned -> (boolean)
                     Whether the message data is specified as a signed value.

                 startBit -> (integer)
                     Indicates  the  beginning  of the CAN signal. This should
                     always be the least significant bit (LSB).

                     This value might be different from the  value  in  a  DBC
                     file.  For  little  endian  signals, startBit is the same
                     value as in the DBC file. For big endian signals in a DBC
                     file,  the  start  bit is the most significant bit (MSB).
                     You will have to calculate the LSB instead and pass it as
                     the startBit .

                 offset -> (double)
                     The  offset  used to calculate the signal value. Combined
                     with factor, the calculation is value = raw_value *  fac-
                     tor + offset .

                 factor -> (double)
                     A multiplier used to decode the CAN message.

                 length -> (integer)
                     How many bytes of data are in the message.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the signal.

              obdSignal -> (structure)

                 pidResponseLength -> (integer)
                     The length of the requested data.

                 serviceMode -> (integer)
                     The mode of operation (diagnostic service) in a message.

                 pid -> (integer)
                     The diagnostic code used to request data from  a  vehicle
                     for this signal.

                 scaling -> (double)

                 offset -> (double)
                     The  offset  used to calculate the signal value. Combined
                     with scaling, the calculation  is  value  =  raw_value  *
                     scaling + offset .

                 startByte -> (integer)
                     Indicates the beginning of the message.

                 byteLength -> (integer)

              messageSignal -> (structure)
                 The  decoding  information  for a specific message which sup-
                 ports higher order data types.

                 topicName -> (string)
                     The topic name for the message signal. It corresponds  to

                 structuredMessage -> (tagged union structure)
                     The  structured message for the message signal. It can be
                     defined with either a primitiveMessageDefinition , struc-
                     turedMessageListDefinition  , or structuredMessageDefini-
