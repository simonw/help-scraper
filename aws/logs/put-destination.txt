PUT-DESTINATION()                                            PUT-DESTINATION()



NAME
       put-destination -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates or updates a destination. This operation is used only to create
       destinations for cross-account subscriptions.

       A destination encapsulates a physical resource (such as an Amazon Kine-
       sis  stream)  and enables you to subscribe to a real-time stream of log
       events for a different account, ingested using PutLogEvents .

       Through an access policy, a destination controls what is written to it.
       By default, PutDestination does not set any access policy with the des-
       tination,   which   means   a   cross-account    user    cannot    call
       PutSubscriptionFilter  against  this  destination.  To enable this, the
       destination owner must call PutDestinationPolicy after PutDestination .

       To perform a PutDestination operation, you must also have the iam:Pass-
       Role permission.

SYNOPSIS
            put-destination
          --destination-name <value>
          --target-arn <value>
          --role-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --destination-name (string)
          A name for the destination.

       --target-arn (string)
          The ARN of an Amazon Kinesis stream to which to deliver matching log
          events.

       --role-arn (string)
          The ARN of an IAM role that grants CloudWatch  Logs  permissions  to
          call  the  Amazon  Kinesis  PutRecord  operation  on the destination
          stream.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       destination -> (structure)
          The destination.

          destinationName -> (string)

          targetArn -> (string)

          roleArn -> (string)
              A role for impersonation, used when delivering log events to the
              target.

          accessPolicy -> (string)
              An IAM policy document that governs which  Amazon  Web  Services

              tion.
