DESCRIBE-QUERY-DEFINITIONS()                      DESCRIBE-QUERY-DEFINITIONS()



NAME
       describe-query-definitions -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  returns a paginated list of your saved CloudWatch Logs
       Insights query definitions.

       You can use the queryDefinitionNamePrefix parameter to  limit  the  re-
       sults  to  only the query definitions that have names that start with a
       certain string.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-query-definitions
          [--query-definition-name-prefix <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --query-definition-name-prefix (string)
          Use this parameter to filter your results to only the query  defini-
          tions that have names that start with the prefix you specify.

       --max-results (integer)
          Limits  the  number  of  returned query definitions to the specified
          number.

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return. The token expires af-
          ter 24 hours.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       queryDefinitions -> (list)
          The list of query definitions that match your request.

          (structure)
              This  structure  contains  details about a saved CloudWatch Logs
              Insights query definition.

              queryDefinitionId -> (string)
                 The unique ID of the query definition.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the query definition.

              queryString -> (string)
                 The query string to use for this definition. For more  infor-
                 mation, see CloudWatch Logs Insights Query Syntax .

              lastModified -> (long)
                 The  date  that  the query definition was most recently modi-
                 fied.

              logGroupNames -> (list)
                 If this query definition contains a list of log  groups  that
                 it is limited to, that list appears here.

                 (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return. The token expires af-
          ter 24 hours.
