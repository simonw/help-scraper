GET-LOG-RECORD()                                              GET-LOG-RECORD()



NAME
       get-log-record -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  all  of  the  fields  and  values of a single log event. All
       fields are retrieved, even if the original query that produced the  lo-
       gRecordPointer  retrieved  only a subset of fields. Fields are returned
       as field name/field value pairs.

       The full unparsed log event is returned within @message .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-log-record
          --log-record-pointer <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --log-record-pointer (string)
          The pointer corresponding to the log event record you  want  to  re-
          trieve.  You  get this from the response of a GetQueryResults opera-
          tion. In that response, the value of the @ptr field for a log  event
          is  the  value  to use as logRecordPointer to retrieve that complete
          log event record.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       logRecord -> (map)
          The requested log event, as a JSON string.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
