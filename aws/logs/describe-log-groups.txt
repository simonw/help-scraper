DESCRIBE-LOG-GROUPS()                                    DESCRIBE-LOG-GROUPS()



NAME
       describe-log-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  specified  log  groups. You can list all your log groups or
       filter the results by prefix. The results are ASCII-sorted by log group
       name.

       CloudWatch  Logs doesnt support IAM policies that control access to the
       DescribeLogGroups action by using the
       ``
       aws:ResourceTag/key-name `` condition key. Other  CloudWatch  Logs  ac-
       tions do support the use of the
       ``
       aws:ResourceTag/key-name  ``  condition key to control access. For more
       information about using tags to control access, see Controlling  access
       to Amazon Web Services resources using tags .

              describe-log-groups is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
              may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data  set  of  re-
              sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate
              argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument  on
              a  paginated  response,  the  --query argument must extract data
              from the results of the following query expressions: logGroups

SYNOPSIS
            describe-log-groups
          [--log-group-name-prefix <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --log-group-name-prefix (string)
          The prefix to match.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command describes a log group named my-logs:

          aws logs describe-log-groups --log-group-name-prefix my-logs

       Output:

          {
              "logGroups": [
                  {
                      "storedBytes": 0,
                      "metricFilterCount": 0,
                      "creationTime": 1433189500783,
                      "logGroupName": "my-logs",
                      "retentionInDays": 5,
                      "arn": "arn:aws:logs:us-west-2:0123456789012:log-group:my-logs:*"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       logGroups -> (list)
          The log groups.

          If the retentionInDays value if not included for a log  group,  then
          that log group is set to have its events never expire.

          (structure)
              Represents a log group.

              logGroupName -> (string)
                 The name of the log group.

              creationTime -> (long)
                 The  creation  time of the log group, expressed as the number
                 of milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.

              retentionInDays -> (integer)
                 The number of days to retain the log events in the  specified
                 log  group.  Possible values are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90,
                 120, 150, 180, 365, 400, 545, 731, 1827, and 3653.

                 To set a log group to  never  have  log  events  expire,  use
                 DeleteRetentionPolicy .

              metricFilterCount -> (integer)
                 The number of metric filters.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the log group.

              storedBytes -> (long)
                 The number of bytes stored.

              kmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the CMK to use when en-
                 crypting log data.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return. The token expires af-
          ter 24 hours.
