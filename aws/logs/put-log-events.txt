PUT-LOG-EVENTS()                                              PUT-LOG-EVENTS()



NAME
       put-log-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Uploads a batch of log events to the specified log stream.

       You  must  include the sequence token obtained from the response of the
       previous call. An upload in a newly created log stream does not require
       a  sequence token. You can also get the sequence token in the expected-
       SequenceToken field from InvalidSequenceTokenException .  If  you  call
       PutLogEvents twice within a narrow time period using the same value for
       sequenceToken , both calls might be successful  or  one  might  be  re-
       jected.

       The batch of events must satisfy the following constraints:

       o The maximum batch size is 1,048,576 bytes. This size is calculated as
         the sum of all event messages in UTF-8, plus 26 bytes  for  each  log
         event.

       o None  of  the log events in the batch can be more than 2 hours in the
         future.

       o None of the log events in the batch can be  older  than  14  days  or
         older than the retention period of the log group.

       o The  log  events in the batch must be in chronological order by their
         timestamp. The timestamp is the time the event occurred, expressed as
         the number of milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. (In Amazon
         Web Services Tools for PowerShell and the Amazon Web Services SDK for
         .NET, the timestamp is specified in .NET format: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.
         For example, 2017-09-15T13:45:30.)

       o A batch of log events in a single request cannot span  more  than  24
         hours. Otherwise, the operation fails.

       o The maximum number of log events in a batch is 10,000.

       o There  is a quota of 5 requests per second per log stream. Additional
         requests are throttled. This quota can't be changed.

       If a call to  PutLogEvents  returns  "UnrecognizedClientException"  the
       most  likely  cause  is an invalid Amazon Web Services access key ID or
       secret key.

SYNOPSIS
            put-log-events
          --log-group-name <value>
          --log-stream-name <value>
          --log-events <value>
          [--sequence-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --log-group-name (string)
          The name of the log group.

       --log-stream-name (string)
          The name of the log stream.

       --log-events (list)
          The log events.

          (structure)
              Represents a log event, which is a record of activity  that  was
              recorded by the application or resource being monitored.

              timestamp -> (long)
                 The  time the event occurred, expressed as the number of mil-
                 liseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.

              message -> (string)
                 The raw event message.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          timestamp=long,message=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "timestamp": long,
              "message": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --sequence-token (string)
          The sequence token obtained from the response of the previous PutLo-
          gEvents  call.  An upload in a newly created log stream does not re-
          quire a sequence token. You can also get the  sequence  token  using
          DescribeLogStreams  . If you call PutLogEvents twice within a narrow
          time period using the same value  for  sequenceToken  ,  both  calls
          might be successful or one might be rejected.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command puts log events to a log stream named 20150601 in
       the log group my-logs:

          aws logs put-log-events --log-group-name my-logs --log-stream-name 20150601 --log-events file://events

       Output:

          {
              "nextSequenceToken": "49542672486831074009579604567656788214806863282469607346"
          }

       The above example reads a JSON array of events from a file named events
       in the current directory:

          [
            {
              "timestamp": 1433190184356,
              "message": "Example Event 1"
            },
            {
              "timestamp": 1433190184358,
              "message": "Example Event 2"
            },
            {
              "timestamp": 1433190184360,
              "message": "Example Event 3"
            }
          ]

       Each subsequent call requires the next sequence token provided  by  the
       previous call to be specified with the sequence token option:

          aws logs put-log-events --log-group-name my-logs --log-stream-name 20150601 --log-events file://events2 --sequence-token "49542672486831074009579604567656788214806863282469607346"

       Output:

          {
              "nextSequenceToken": "49542672486831074009579604567900991230369019956308219826"
          }

OUTPUT
       nextSequenceToken -> (string)
          The next sequence token.

       rejectedLogEventsInfo -> (structure)
          The rejected events.

          tooNewLogEventStartIndex -> (integer)
              The log events that are too new.

          tooOldLogEventEndIndex -> (integer)
              The log events that are too old.

          expiredLogEventEndIndex -> (integer)
              The expired log events.
