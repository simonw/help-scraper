DESCRIBE-LOG-STREAMS()                                  DESCRIBE-LOG-STREAMS()



NAME
       describe-log-streams -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the log streams for the specified log group. You can list all the
       log streams or filter the results by prefix. You can also  control  how
       the results are ordered.

       This operation has a limit of five transactions per second, after which
       transactions are throttled.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-log-streams is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: logStreams

SYNOPSIS
            describe-log-streams
          --log-group-name <value>
          [--log-stream-name-prefix <value>]
          [--order-by <value>]
          [--descending | --no-descending]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --log-group-name (string)
          The name of the log group.

       --log-stream-name-prefix (string)
          The prefix to match.

          If orderBy is LastEventTime , you cannot specify this parameter.

       --order-by (string)
          If  the  value  is  LogStreamName  ,  the results are ordered by log
          stream name. If the value is LastEventTime , the results are ordered
          by the event time. The default value is LogStreamName .

          If  you  order  the  results  by  event time, you cannot specify the
          logStreamNamePrefix parameter.
              lastEventTimestamp represents the time of the  most  recent  log
              event  in  the log stream in CloudWatch Logs. This number is ex-
              pressed as the number of milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00
              UTC.  lastEventTimestamp  updates on an eventual consistency ba-
              sis. It typically updates in less than an hour  from  ingestion,
              but in rare situations might take longer.

          Possible values:

          o LogStreamName

          o LastEventTime

       --descending | --no-descending (boolean)
          If  the  value is true, results are returned in descending order. If
          the value is to false, results are returned in ascending order.  The
          default value is false.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command shows all log streams starting  with  the  prefix
       2015 in the log group my-logs:

          aws logs describe-log-streams --log-group-name my-logs --log-stream-name-prefix 2015

       Output:

          {
              "logStreams": [
                  {
                      "creationTime": 1433189871774,
                      "arn": "arn:aws:logs:us-west-2:0123456789012:log-group:my-logs:log-stream:20150531",
                      "logStreamName": "20150531",
                      "storedBytes": 0
                  },
                  {
                      "creationTime": 1433189873898,
                      "arn": "arn:aws:logs:us-west-2:0123456789012:log-group:my-logs:log-stream:20150601",
                      "logStreamName": "20150601",
                      "storedBytes": 0
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       logStreams -> (list)
          The log streams.

          (structure)
              Represents  a log stream, which is a sequence of log events from
              a single emitter of logs.

              logStreamName -> (string)
                 The name of the log stream.

              creationTime -> (long)
                 The creation time of the stream, expressed as the  number  of
                 milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.

              firstEventTimestamp -> (long)
                 The  time of the first event, expressed as the number of mil-
                 liseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.

              lastEventTimestamp -> (long)
                 The time of the most recent log event in the  log  stream  in
                 CloudWatch  Logs.  This  number is expressed as the number of
                 milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.  The  lastEvent-
                 Time value updates on an eventual consistency basis. It typi-
                 cally updates in less than an hour  from  ingestion,  but  in
                 rare situations might take longer.

              lastIngestionTime -> (long)
                 The  ingestion  time, expressed as the number of milliseconds
                 after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.

              uploadSequenceToken -> (string)
                 The sequence token.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the log stream.

              storedBytes -> (long)
                 The number of bytes stored.
                     Important: On June 17, 2019, this  parameter  was  depre-
                     cated  for  log  streams, and is always reported as zero.
                     This change applies only to log streams. The  storedBytes
                     parameter for log groups is not affected.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return. The token expires af-
          ter 24 hours.
