NAME
       describe-metric-filters -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the specified metric filters. You can list all of the metric fil-
       ters or filter the results by log name, prefix, metric name, or  metric
       namespace. The results are ASCII-sorted by filter name.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-metric-filters  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: metricFilters

OPTIONS
       --log-group-name (string)
          The name of the log group.

       --filter-name-prefix (string)
          The prefix to match. CloudWatch Logs uses the  value  you  set  here
          only if you also include the logGroupName parameter in your request.

       --metric-name (string)
          Filters  results  to  include  only  those with the specified metric
          name. If you include this parameter in your request, you  must  also
          include the metricNamespace parameter.

       --metric-namespace (string)
          Filters results to include only those in the specified namespace. If
          you include this parameter in your request, you  must  also  include
          the metricName parameter.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       metricFilters -> (list)
          The metric filters.

          (structure)
              Metric  filters express how CloudWatch Logs would extract metric
              observations from ingested log events and  transform  them  into
              metric data in a CloudWatch metric.

              filterName -> (string)
                 The name of the metric filter.

              filterPattern -> (string)
                 A  symbolic  description of how CloudWatch Logs should inter-
                 pret the data in each log event. For example, a log event can
                 contain timestamps, IP addresses, strings, and so on. You use
                 the filter pattern to specify what to look  for  in  the  log
                 event message.

              metricTransformations -> (list)
                 The metric transformations.

                 (structure)
                     Indicates  how to transform ingested log events to metric
                     data in a CloudWatch metric.

                     metricName -> (string)
                        The name of the CloudWatch metric.

                     metricNamespace -> (string)
                        A custom namespace to contain your  metric  in  Cloud-
                        Watch.  Use  namespaces to group together metrics that
                        are similar. For more information, see Namespaces .

                     metricValue -> (string)
                        The value to publish to the CloudWatch metric  when  a
                        filter pattern matches a log event.

                     defaultValue -> (double)
                        (Optional)  The  value  to  emit when a filter pattern
                        does not match a log event. This value can be null.

                     dimensions -> (map)
                        The fields to use as dimensions for  the  metric.  One
                        metric filter can include as many as three dimensions.

                        WARNING:
                            Metrics  extracted  from log events are charged as
                            custom  metrics.  To   prevent   unexpected   high
                            charges,  do  not  specify high-cardinality fields
                            such as IPAddress or requestID as dimensions. Each
                            different  value  found for a dimension is treated
                            as a separate metric and accrues charges as a sep-
                            arate custom metric.

                            To  help  prevent  accidental high charges, Amazon
                            disables a metric filter if it generates 1000 dif-
                            ferent  name/value  pairs  for the dimensions that
                            you have specified  within  a  certain  amount  of
                            time.

                            You  can  also set up a billing alarm to alert you
                            if your charges are higher than expected. For more
                            information, see Creating a Billing Alarm to Moni-
                            tor Your Estimated Amazon Web Services Charges .

                        value -> (string)

                     unit -> (string)
                        The unit to assign to the metric. If  you  omit  this,
                        the unit is set as None .

              creationTime -> (long)
                 The creation time of the metric filter, expressed as the num-
                 ber of milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.
