DESCRIBE-METRIC-FILTERS()                            DESCRIBE-METRIC-FILTERS()



NAME
       describe-metric-filters -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the specified metric filters. You can list all of the metric fil-
       ters or filter the results by log name, prefix, metric name, or  metric
       namespace. The results are ASCII-sorted by filter name.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-metric-filters  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: metricFilters

SYNOPSIS
            describe-metric-filters
          [--log-group-name <value>]
          [--filter-name-prefix <value>]
          [--metric-name <value>]
          [--metric-namespace <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --log-group-name (string)
          The name of the log group.

       --filter-name-prefix (string)
          The prefix to match. CloudWatch Logs uses the  value  you  set  here
          only if you also include the logGroupName parameter in your request.

       --metric-name (string)
          Filters  results  to  include  only  those with the specified metric
          name. If you include this parameter in your request, you  must  also
          include the metricNamespace parameter.

       --metric-namespace (string)
          Filters results to include only those in the specified namespace. If
          you include this parameter in your request, you  must  also  include
          the metricName parameter.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       metricFilters -> (list)
          The metric filters.

          (structure)
              Metric  filters express how CloudWatch Logs would extract metric
              observations from ingested log events and  transform  them  into
              metric data in a CloudWatch metric.

              filterName -> (string)
                 The name of the metric filter.

              filterPattern -> (string)
                 A  symbolic  description of how CloudWatch Logs should inter-
                 pret the data in each log event. For example, a log event can
                 contain timestamps, IP addresses, strings, and so on. You use
                 the filter pattern to specify what to look  for  in  the  log
                 event message.

              metricTransformations -> (list)
                 The metric transformations.

                 (structure)
                     Indicates  how to transform ingested log events to metric
                     data in a CloudWatch metric.

                     metricName -> (string)
                        The name of the CloudWatch metric.

                     metricNamespace -> (string)
                        A custom namespace to contain your  metric  in  Cloud-
                        Watch.  Use  namespaces to group together metrics that
                        are similar. For more information, see Namespaces .

                     metricValue -> (string)
                        The value to publish to the CloudWatch metric  when  a
                        filter pattern matches a log event.

                     defaultValue -> (double)
                        (Optional)  The  value  to  emit when a filter pattern
                        does not match a log event. This value can be null.

                     dimensions -> (map)
                        The fields to use as dimensions for  the  metric.  One
                        metric filter can include as many as three dimensions.

                        WARNING:
                            Metrics  extracted  from log events are charged as
                            custom  metrics.  To   prevent   unexpected   high
                            charges,  do  not  specify high-cardinality fields
                            such as IPAddress or requestID as dimensions. Each
                            different  value  found for a dimension is treated
                            as a separate metric and accrues charges as a sep-
                            arate custom metric.

                            To  help  prevent  accidental high charges, Amazon
                            disables a metric filter if it generates 1000 dif-
                            ferent  name/value  pairs  for the dimensions that
                            you have specified  within  a  certain  amount  of
                            time.

                            You  can  also set up a billing alarm to alert you
                            if your charges are higher than expected. For more
                            information, see Creating a Billing Alarm to Moni-
                            tor Your Estimated Amazon Web Services Charges .

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (string)

                     unit -> (string)
                        The unit to assign to the metric. If  you  omit  this,
                        the unit is set as None .

              creationTime -> (long)
                 The creation time of the metric filter, expressed as the num-
                 ber of milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.

              logGroupName -> (string)
                 The name of the log group.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return. The token expires af-
          ter 24 hours.
