PUT-QUERY-DEFINITION()                                  PUT-QUERY-DEFINITION()



NAME
       put-query-definition -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates or updates a query definition for CloudWatch Logs Insights. For
       more information, see Analyzing Log Data with CloudWatch Logs  Insights
       .

       To update a query definition, specify its queryDefinitionId in your re-
       quest. The values of name , queryString , and logGroupNames are changed
       to  the  values  that  you specify in your update operation. No current
       values are retained from the current query definition. For example,  if
       you update a current query definition that includes log groups, and you
       don't specify the logGroupNames parameter in your update operation, the
       query definition changes to contain no log groups.

       You must have the logs:PutQueryDefinition permission to be able to per-
       form this operation.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-query-definition
          --name <value>
          [--query-definition-id <value>]
          [--log-group-names <value>]
          --query-string <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A name for the query definition. If you are saving a  lot  of  query
          definitions,  we recommend that you name them so that you can easily
          find the ones you want by using the first part of the name as a fil-
          ter     in     the     queryDefinitionNamePrefix     parameter    of
          DescribeQueryDefinitions .

       --query-definition-id (string)
          If you are updating a query definition, use this parameter to  spec-
          ify  the ID of the query definition that you want to update. You can
          use DescribeQueryDefinitions to retrieve the IDs of your saved query
          definitions.

          If  you are creating a query definition, do not specify this parame-
          ter. CloudWatch generates a unique ID for the new  query  definition
          and include it in the response to this operation.

       --log-group-names (list)
          Use  this  parameter  to include specific log groups as part of your
          query definition.

          If you are updating a query definition and you omit this  parameter,
          then the updated definition will contain no log groups.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --query-string (string)
          The  query  string to use for this definition. For more information,
          see CloudWatch Logs Insights Query Syntax .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       queryDefinitionId -> (string)
          The ID of the query definition.
