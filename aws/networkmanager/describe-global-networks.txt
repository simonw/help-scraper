DESCRIBE-GLOBAL-NETWORKS()                          DESCRIBE-GLOBAL-NETWORKS()



NAME
       describe-global-networks -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  one or more global networks. By default, all global networks
       are described. To describe the objects in your global network, you must
       use the appropriate Get* action. For example, to list the transit gate-
       ways in your global network, use  GetTransitGatewayRegistrations .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-global-networks is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: GlobalNetworks

SYNOPSIS
            describe-global-networks
          [--global-network-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-network-ids (list)
          The IDs of one or more global networks. The maximum is 10.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe your global networks

       The  following  describe-global-networks  example describes all of your
       global networks in your account.

          aws networkmanager describe-global-networks \
              --region us-west-2

       Output:

          {
              "GlobalNetworks": [
                  {
                      "GlobalNetworkId": "global-network-01231231231231231",
                      "GlobalNetworkArn": "arn:aws:networkmanager::123456789012:global-network/global-network-01231231231231231",
                      "Description": "Company 1 global network",
                      "CreatedAt": 1575553525.0,
                      "State": "AVAILABLE"
                  }
              ]
          }

          (structure)
              Describes a global network. This is  a  single  private  network

              GlobalNetworkArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the global network.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the global network.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the global network was created.

              State -> (string)
                 The state of the global network.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags for the global network.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The tag key.

                        Constraints: Maximum length of 128 characters.

                     Value -> (string)
