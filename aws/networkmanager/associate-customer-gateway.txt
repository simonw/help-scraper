ASSOCIATE-CUSTOMER-GATEWAY()                      ASSOCIATE-CUSTOMER-GATEWAY()



NAME
       associate-customer-gateway -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  a  customer  gateway  with  a device and optionally, with a
       link. If you specify a link, it must be associated with  the  specified
       device.

       You  can  only  associate customer gateways that are connected to a VPN
       attachment on a transit gateway or  core  network  registered  in  your
       global  network.  When  you register a transit gateway or core network,
       customer gateways that are connected to the transit gateway  are  auto-
       matically  included  in  the  global network. To list customer gateways
       that are connected to a transit gateway, use the DescribeVpnConnections
       EC2 API and filter by transit-gateway-id .

       You  cannot  associate a customer gateway with more than one device and
       link.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            associate-customer-gateway
          --customer-gateway-arn <value>
          --global-network-id <value>
          --device-id <value>
          [--link-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --customer-gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the customer gateway.

       --global-network-id (string)
          The ID of the global network.

       --device-id (string)
          The ID of the device.

       --link-id (string)
          The ID of the link.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To associate a customer gateway

       The following associate-customer-gateway  example  associates  customer
       gateway  cgw-11223344556677889 in the specified global network with de-
       vice device-07f6fd08867abc123.

          aws networkmanager associate-customer-gateway \
              --customer-gateway-arn arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:customer-gateway/cgw-11223344556677889  \
              --global-network-id global-network-01231231231231231 \
              --device-id device-07f6fd08867abc123 \
              --region us-west-2

       Output:

          {
              "CustomerGatewayAssociation": {
                  "CustomerGatewayArn": "arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:customer-gateway/cgw-11223344556677889",
                  "GlobalNetworkId": "global-network-01231231231231231",
                  "DeviceId": "device-07f6fd08867abc123",
                  "State": "PENDING"
              }
          }
