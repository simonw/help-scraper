OPTIONS
       --global-network-id (string)
          The ID of the global network.

       --source (structure)
          The source from which traffic originates.

          TransitGatewayAttachmentArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the transit gateway attachment.

          IpAddress -> (string)
              The IP address.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TransitGatewayAttachmentArn=string,IpAddress=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TransitGatewayAttachmentArn": "string",
            "IpAddress": "string"
          }

       --destination (structure)
          The destination.

          TransitGatewayAttachmentArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the transit gateway attachment.

          IpAddress -> (string)
              The IP address.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TransitGatewayAttachmentArn=string,IpAddress=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TransitGatewayAttachmentArn": "string",
            "IpAddress": "string"
          }

       --include-return-path | --no-include-return-path (boolean)
          Indicates whether to analyze the return path. The default is false .

       --use-middleboxes | --no-use-middleboxes (boolean)
          Indicates whether to include the location of middlebox appliances in
          the route analysis. The default is false .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
