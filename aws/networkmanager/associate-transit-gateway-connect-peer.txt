ASSOCIATE-TRANSIT-GATEWAY-CONNECT-PEERASSOCIATE-TRANSIT-GATEWAY-CONNECT-PEER()



NAME
       associate-transit-gateway-connect-peer -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  a  transit  gateway Connect peer with a device, and option-
       ally, with a link. If you specify a link, it must  be  associated  with
       the specified device.

       You  can  only  associate  transit gateway Connect peers that have been
       created on a transit gateway that's registered in your global network.

       You cannot associate a transit gateway Connect peer with more than  one
       device and link.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            associate-transit-gateway-connect-peer
          --global-network-id <value>
          --transit-gateway-connect-peer-arn <value>
          --device-id <value>
          [--link-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-network-id (string)
          The ID of the global network.

       --transit-gateway-connect-peer-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Connect peer.

       --device-id (string)
          The ID of the device.

       --link-id (string)
          The ID of the link.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TransitGatewayConnectPeerAssociation -> (structure)

              peer.

          GlobalNetworkId -> (string)
              The ID of the global network.

          DeviceId -> (string)
              The ID of the device.

          LinkId -> (string)
