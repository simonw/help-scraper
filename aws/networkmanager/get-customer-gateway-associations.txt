NAME
       get-customer-gateway-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the association information for customer gateways that are associ-
       ated with devices and links in your global network.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-customer-gateway-associations is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: CustomerGatewayAssociations

SYNOPSIS
            get-customer-gateway-associations
          --global-network-id <value>
          [--customer-gateway-arns <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-network-id (string)
          The ID of the global network.

       --customer-gateway-arns (list)
          One or more customer gateway Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). The maxi-
          mum is 10.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get your customer gateway associations

       The following get-customer-gateway-associations example gets  the  cus-
       tomer gateway associations for the specified global network.

          aws networkmanager get-customer-gateway-associations \
              --global-network-id global-network-01231231231231231 \
              --region us-west-2

       Output:

          {
              "CustomerGatewayAssociations": [
                  {
                      "CustomerGatewayArn": "arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:customer-gateway/cgw-11223344556677889",
                      "GlobalNetworkId": "global-network-01231231231231231",
                      "DeviceId": "device-07f6fd08867abc123",
                      "State": "AVAILABLE"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       CustomerGatewayAssociations -> (list)
          The customer gateway associations.

          (structure)
              Describes  the association between a customer gateway, a device,
              and a link.

              DeviceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the device.

              LinkId -> (string)
                 The ID of the link.

              State -> (string)
                 The association state.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next page of results.
