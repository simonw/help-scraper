NAME
       get-network-resource-relationships -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the  network resource relationships for the specified global net-
       work.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-network-resource-relationships is a paginated  operation.  Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: Relationships

SYNOPSIS
            get-network-resource-relationships
          --global-network-id <value>
          [--core-network-id <value>]
          [--registered-gateway-arn <value>]
          [--aws-region <value>]
          [--account-id <value>]
          [--resource-type <value>]
          [--resource-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-network-id (string)
          The ID of the global network.

       --core-network-id (string)
          The ID of a core network.

       --registered-gateway-arn (string)
          The ARN of the registered gateway.

       --aws-region (string)
          The Amazon Web Services Region.

       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID.

       --resource-type (string)
          The resource type.

          The following are the supported resource types for Direct Connect:

          o dxcon

          o dx-gateway

          o dx-vif

          The following are the supported resource types for Network Manager:

          o connection

          o device

          o link

          o site

          The following are the supported resource types for Amazon VPC:

          o customer-gateway

          o transit-gateway

          o transit-gateway-attachment

          o transit-gateway-connect-peer

          o transit-gateway-route-table

          o vpn-connection

       --resource-arn (string)
          The ARN of the gateway.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              Describes a resource relationship.

              From -> (string)
                 The ARN of the resource.
