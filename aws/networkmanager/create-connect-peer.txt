CREATE-CONNECT-PEER()                                    CREATE-CONNECT-PEER()



NAME
       create-connect-peer -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  core network connect peer for a specified core network con-
       nect attachment between a core network and an appliance. The  peer  ad-
       dress  and  transit  gateway address must be the same IP address family
       (IPv4 or IPv6).

OPTIONS
       --connect-attachment-id (string)
          The ID of the connection attachment.

       --core-network-address (string)
          A Connect peer core network address.

       --peer-address (string)
          The Connect peer address.

       --bgp-options (structure)
          The Connect peer BGP options.

          PeerAsn -> (long)
              The Peer ASN of the BGP.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          PeerAsn=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "PeerAsn": long
          }

       --inside-cidr-blocks (list)
          The inside IP addresses used for BGP peering.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          The tags associated with the peer request.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag key.

                 Constraints: Maximum length of 128 characters.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag value.

                 Constraints: Maximum length of 256 characters.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-token (string)
          The client token associated with the request.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
