NAME
       get-transit-gateway-registrations -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about the transit gateway registrations in a specified
       global network.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-transit-gateway-registrations is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: TransitGatewayRegistrations

SYNOPSIS
            get-transit-gateway-registrations
          --global-network-id <value>
          [--transit-gateway-arns <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-network-id (string)
          The ID of the global network.

       --transit-gateway-arns (list)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Names (ARNs) of one or more transit gateways.
          The maximum is 10.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get your transit gateway registrations

       The  following get-transit-gateway-registrations example gets the tran-
       sit gateways that are registered to the specified global network.

          aws networkmanager get-transit-gateway-registrations \
              --global-network-id global-network-01231231231231231 \
              --region us-west-2

       Output:

          {
              "TransitGatewayRegistrations": [
                  {
                      "GlobalNetworkId": "global-network-01231231231231231",
                      "TransitGatewayArn": "arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:transit-gateway/tgw-123abc05e04123abc",
                      "State": {
                          "Code": "AVAILABLE"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       TransitGatewayRegistrations -> (list)
          The transit gateway registrations.

          (structure)
              Describes the registration of a transit gateway to a global net-
              work.

              GlobalNetworkId -> (string)
                 The ID of the global network.

              TransitGatewayArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the transit gateway.

              State -> (structure)
                 The state of the transit gateway registration.

                 Code -> (string)
                     The code for the state reason.

                 Message -> (string)
                     The message for the state reason.
