MODIFY-ID-FORMAT()                                          MODIFY-ID-FORMAT()



NAME
       modify-id-format -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  the  ID format for the specified resource on a per-Region ba-
       sis. You can specify that resources should receive longer IDs (17-char-
       acter IDs) when they are created.

       This request can only be used to modify longer ID settings for resource
       types that are within the opt-in period. Resources currently  in  their
       opt-in  period  include:  bundle | conversion-task | customer-gateway |
       dhcp-options | elastic-ip-allocation  |  elastic-ip-association  |  ex-
       port-task  |  flow-log  | image | import-task | internet-gateway | net-
       work-acl | network-acl-association | network-interface | network-inter-
       face-attachment | prefix-list | route-table | route-table-association |
       security-group  |  subnet  |  subnet-cidr-block-association  |  vpc   |
       vpc-cidr-block-association  |  vpc-endpoint  | vpc-peering-connection |
       vpn-connection | vpn-gateway .

       This setting applies to the IAM user who makes the request; it does not
       apply  to  the  entire  Amazon Web Services account. By default, an IAM
       user defaults to the same settings as the root user.  If  you're  using
       this  action  as the root user, then these settings apply to the entire
       account, unless an IAM user explicitly  overrides  these  settings  for
       themselves.  For more information, see Resource IDs in the Amazon Elas-
       tic Compute Cloud User Guide .

       Resources created with longer IDs are visible  to  all  IAM  roles  and
       users, regardless of these settings and provided that they have permis-
       sion to use the relevant Describe command for the resource type.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-id-format
          --resource <value>
          --use-long-ids | --no-use-long-ids
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource (string)
          The type of resource: bundle | conversion-task | customer-gateway  |
          dhcp-options  | elastic-ip-allocation | elastic-ip-association | ex-
          port-task | flow-log | image | import-task | internet-gateway | net-
          work-acl | network-acl-association | network-interface | network-in-
          terface-attachment | prefix-list | route-table | route-table-associ-
          ation  |  security-group  | subnet | subnet-cidr-block-association |
          vpc | vpc-cidr-block-association | vpc-endpoint  |  vpc-peering-con-
          nection | vpn-connection | vpn-gateway .

          Alternatively,  use  the  all-current option to include all resource
          types that are currently within their opt-in period for longer IDs.

       --use-long-ids | --no-use-long-ids (boolean)
          Indicate whether the resource should use  longer  IDs  (17-character
          IDs).

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To enable the longer ID format for a resource

       The following modify-id-format example enables the longer ID format for
       the instance resource type.

          aws ec2 modify-id-format \
              --resource instance \
              --use-long-ids

       To disable the longer ID format for a resource

       The following modify-id-format example disables the  longer  ID  format
       for the instance resource type.

          aws ec2 modify-id-format \
              --resource instance \
              --no-use-long-ids

       The following modify-id-format example enables the longer ID format for
       all supported resource types that are within their opt-in period.

          aws ec2 modify-id-format \
              --resource all-current \
              --use-long-ids

OUTPUT
       None
