REVOKE-SECURITY-GROUP-INGRESS()                REVOKE-SECURITY-GROUP-INGRESS()



NAME
       revoke-security-group-ingress -

       NOTE:
          To  specify  multiple rules in a single command use the --ip-permis-
          sions option

DESCRIPTION
       Removes the specified inbound (ingress) rules from a security group.

       You can specify rules using either rule  IDs  or  security  group  rule
       properties.  If  you  use  rule properties, the values that you specify
       (for example, ports) must match the  existing  rule's  values  exactly.
       Each  rule  has  a protocol, from and to ports, and source (CIDR range,
       security group, or prefix list). For the TCP  and  UDP  protocols,  you
       must  also specify the destination port or range of ports. For the ICMP
       protocol, you must also specify the ICMP type and code. If the security
       group  rule  has a description, you do not need to specify the descrip-
       tion to revoke the rule.

       [EC2-Classic, default VPC] If the values you specify do not  match  the
       existing  rule's values, no error is returned, and the output describes
       the security group rules that were not revoked.

       Amazon Web Services recommends that you describe the security group  to
       verify that the rules were removed.

       Rule  changes  are propagated to instances within the security group as
       quickly as possible. However, a small delay might occur.

       NOTE:
          We are retiring EC2-Classic on August 15, 2022.  We  recommend  that
          you  migrate  from  EC2-Classic  to a VPC. For more information, see
          Migrate from EC2-Classic to a VPC  in  the  Amazon  Elastic  Compute
          Cloud User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --group-id (string)
          The  ID  of the security group. You must specify either the security
          group ID or the security group name in  the  request.  For  security
          groups in a nondefault VPC, you must specify the security group ID.

       --group-name (string)
          [EC2-Classic,  default VPC] The name of the security group. You must
          specify either the security group ID or the security group  name  in
          the request.

       --ip-permissions (list)
          The  sets  of  IP  permissions.  You can't specify a source security
          group and a CIDR IP address range in the same set of permissions.

              FromPort -> (integer)
                 The start of port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or  an
                 ICMP/ICMPv6   type  number.  A  value  of  -1  indicates  all
                 ICMP/ICMPv6 types. If you specify all ICMP/ICMPv6 types,  you
                 must specify all codes.

              IpProtocol -> (string)
                 The  IP  protocol name (tcp , udp , icmp , icmpv6 ) or number
                 (see Protocol Numbers ).

                 [VPC only] Use -1 to specify all protocols. When  authorizing
                 security  group  rules,  specifying  -1  or a protocol number
                 other than tcp , udp , icmp , or icmpv6 allows traffic on all
                 ports,  regardless  of  any port range you specify. For tcp ,
                 udp , and icmp , you must specify a port range. For icmpv6  ,
                 the port range is optional; if you omit the port range, traf-
                 fic for all types and codes is allowed.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --security-group-rule-ids (list)
          The IDs of the security group rules.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --protocol (string)
          The IP protocol: tcp | udp | icmp

          (VPC only) Use all to specify all protocols.

          If  this  argument is provided without also providing the port argu-
          ment, then it will be applied to all ports for the specified  proto-
          col.

       --port (string)
          For  TCP  or UDP: The range of ports to allow. A single integer or a
          range (min-max ).

          For ICMP: A single integer or a range (type-code ) representing  the
          ICMP  type  number and the ICMP code number respectively. A value of
          -1 indicates all ICMP codes for all ICMP types. A value of  -1  just
          for type indicates all ICMP codes for the specified ICMP type.

       --cidr (string)
          The CIDR IP range.

       --source-group (string)
          The name or ID of the source security group.

       --group-owner (string)
          The  AWS  account  ID that owns the source security group. Cannot be
          used when specifying a CIDR IP address.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To remove a rule from a security group

       The following revoke-security-group-ingress example removes TCP port 22
       access for the 203.0.113.0/24 address range from the specified security
       group for a default VPC.

          aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress \
              --group-name mySecurityGroup
              --protocol tcp \
              --port 22 \
              --cidr 203.0.113.0/24

       This command produces no output if it succeeds.

       For more information, see Security groups in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

       Example 2: To remove a rule using the IP permissions set

       The following revoke-security-group-ingress example uses the ip-permis-
       sions  parameter to remove an inbound rule that allows the ICMP message
       Destination Unreachable: Fragmentation Needed and  Don't  Fragment  was
       Set (Type 3, Code 4).

          aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress \
              --group-id sg-026c12253ce15eff7 \
              --ip-permissions IpProtocol=icmp,FromPort=3,ToPort=4,IpRanges=[{CidrIp=0.0.0.0/0}]

       This command produces no output if it succeeds.

       For more information, see Security groups in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

OUTPUT
       Return -> (boolean)
          Returns true if the request succeeds; otherwise, returns an error.

       UnknownIpPermissions -> (list)
          The  inbound  rules that were unknown to the service. In some cases,
          unknownIpPermissionSet might be in a different format from  the  re-
          quest parameter.

          (structure)
              Describes a set of permissions for a security group rule.

              FromPort -> (integer)
                 The  start of port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an
                 ICMP/ICMPv6  type  number.  A  value  of  -1  indicates   all
                 ICMP/ICMPv6  types. If you specify all ICMP/ICMPv6 types, you
                 must specify all codes.

              IpProtocol -> (string)
                 The IP protocol name (tcp , udp , icmp , icmpv6 )  or  number
                 (see Protocol Numbers ).

                 [VPC  only] Use -1 to specify all protocols. When authorizing
                 security group rules, specifying  -1  or  a  protocol  number
                 other than tcp , udp , icmp , or icmpv6 allows traffic on all
                 ports, regardless of any port range you specify.  For  tcp  ,
                 udp  , and icmp , you must specify a port range. For icmpv6 ,
                 the port range is optional; if you omit the port range, traf-
                 fic for all types and codes is allowed.

                        fault VPC only. For a security group in  a  nondefault
                        VPC, use the security group ID.

                        For  a  referenced security group in another VPC, this
                        value is not returned if the referenced security group
