NAME
       describe-image-attribute -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified attribute of the specified AMI. You can specify
       only one attribute at a time.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-image-attribute
          --attribute <value>
          --image-id <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --attribute (string)
          The AMI attribute.
              Note : The blockDeviceMapping  attribute  is  deprecated.  Using
              this  attribute returns the Client.AuthFailure error. To get in-
              formation about the block device mappings for an  AMI,  use  the
              DescribeImages action.

          Possible values:

          o description

          o kernel

          o ramdisk

          o launchPermission

          o productCodes

          o blockDeviceMapping

          o sriovNetSupport

          o bootMode

       --image-id (string)
          The ID of the AMI.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe the launch permissions for an AMI

       This example describes the launch permissions for the specified AMI.

       Command:

          aws ec2 describe-image-attribute --image-id ami-5731123e --attribute launchPermission

       Output:

          {
              "LaunchPermissions": [
                  {
                      "UserId": "123456789012"
                  }
              ],
              "ImageId": "ami-5731123e",
          }

       To describe the product codes for an AMI

       This  example  describes  the product codes for the specified AMI. Note
       that this AMI has no product codes.

       Command:

          aws ec2 describe-image-attribute --image-id ami-5731123e --attribute productCodes

       Output:

          {
              "ProductCodes": [],
              "ImageId": "ami-5731123e",
          }

OUTPUT
       BlockDeviceMappings -> (list)
          The block device mapping entries.

          (structure)
              Describes a block device mapping, which defines the EBS  volumes
              and instance store volumes to attach to an instance at launch.

              DeviceName -> (string)
                 The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

              VirtualName -> (string)
                 The virtual device name (ephemeral N). Instance store volumes
                 are numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2  avail-
                 able   instance   store  volumes  can  specify  mappings  for
                 ephemeral0 and ephemeral1 . The number of available  instance
                 store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect
                 to the instance, you must mount the volume.

                 NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enumerated  and
                 assigned  a  device name. Including them in your block device
                 mapping has no effect.

                 Constraints: For M3  instances,  you  must  specify  instance
                 store  volumes  in the block device mapping for the instance.
                 When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance  store
                 volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.

              Ebs -> (structure)
                 Parameters  used to automatically set up EBS volumes when the
                 instance is launched.

                 DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted  on  instance
                     termination.  For more information, see Preserving Amazon
                     EBS volumes on instance termination  in  the  Amazon  EC2
                     User Guide .

                 Iops -> (integer)
                     The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3 ,
                     io1 , and io2 volumes, this represents the number of IOPS
                     that  are  provisioned  for  the volume. For gp2 volumes,
                     this represents the baseline performance  of  the  volume
                     and  the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits
                     for bursting.

                     The following are the supported values  for  each  volume
                     type:

                     o gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS

                     o io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                     o io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                     For  io1  and  io2 volumes, we guarantee 64,000 IOPS only
                     for Instances built on the Nitro System . Other  instance
                     families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

                     This  parameter  is required for io1 and io2 volumes. The
                     default for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS. This parameter  is
                     not supported for gp2 , st1 , sc1 , or standard volumes.

                 SnapshotId -> (string)
                     The ID of the snapshot.

                 VolumeSize -> (integer)
                     The  size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify either
                     a snapshot ID or a volume size. If you  specify  a  snap-
                     shot, the default is the snapshot size. You can specify a
                     volume size that is equal to or larger than the  snapshot
                     size.

                     The  following  are  the supported volumes sizes for each
                     volume type:

                     o gp2 and gp3 :1-16,384

                     o io1 and io2 : 4-16,384

                     o st1 and sc1 : 125-16,384

                     o standard : 1-1,024

                 VolumeType -> (string)
                     The volume type. For more  information,  see  Amazon  EBS
                     volume types in the Amazon EC2 User Guide . If the volume
                     type is io1 or io2 , you must specify the IOPS  that  the
                     volume supports.

                 KmsKeyId -> (string)
                     Identifier  (key ID, key alias, ID ARN, or alias ARN) for
                     a customer managed CMK under which the EBS volume is  en-
                     crypted.

                     This  parameter  is  only supported on BlockDeviceMapping
                     objects called by RunInstances , RequestSpotFleet  ,  and
                     RequestSpotInstances .

                 Throughput -> (integer)
                     The throughput that the volume supports, in MiB/s.

                     This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes.

                     Valid Range: Minimum value of 125. Maximum value of 1000.

                 OutpostArn -> (string)
                     The ARN of the Outpost on which the snapshot is stored.

                 Encrypted -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  whether  the encryption state of an EBS volume
                     is changed while being restored from a backing  snapshot.
                     The  effect  of  setting the encryption state to true de-
                     pends on the volume origin  (new  or  from  a  snapshot),
                     starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryp-
                     tion by default is enabled.  For  more  information,  see
                     Amazon EBS encryption in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

                     In  no  case  can you remove encryption from an encrypted
                     volume.

                     Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances  that
                     support  Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see
                     Supported instance types .

                     This parameter is not returned by  DescribeImageAttribute
                     .

              NoDevice -> (string)
                 To  omit the device from the block device mapping, specify an
                 empty string. When this property is specified, the device  is
                 removed  from  the block device mapping regardless of the as-
                 signed value.

       ImageId -> (string)
