       --description (string)
          A description for the network interface.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --groups (list)
          The IDs of one or more security groups.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --ipv6-address-count (integer)
          The  number of IPv6 addresses to assign to a network interface. Ama-
          zon EC2 automatically selects the IPv6  addresses  from  the  subnet
          range.  You  can't  use  this option if specifying specific IPv6 ad-
          dresses. If your subnet has the  AssignIpv6AddressOnCreation  attri-
          bute set to true , you can specify 0 to override this setting.

       --ipv6-addresses (list)
          One  or  more specific IPv6 addresses from the IPv6 CIDR block range
          of your subnet. You can't use this option  if  you're  specifying  a
          number of IPv6 addresses.

          (structure)
              Describes an IPv6 address.

              Ipv6Address -> (string)
                 The IPv6 address.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Ipv6Address=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Ipv6Address": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --private-ip-address (string)
          The  primary  private  IPv4 address of the network interface. If you
          don't specify an IPv4 address, Amazon EC2 selects one for  you  from
          the subnet's IPv4 CIDR range. If you specify an IP address, you can-
          not indicate any IP addresses  specified  in  privateIpAddresses  as
          primary (only one IP address can be designated as primary).

       --private-ip-addresses (list)
          One or more private IPv4 addresses.

          (structure)
              Describes  a secondary private IPv4 address for a network inter-
              face.

              Primary -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the private IPv4  address  is  the  primary
                 private IPv4 address. Only one IPv4 address can be designated
                 as primary.

              PrivateIpAddress -> (string)
                 The private IPv4 addresses.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Primary": true|false,
              "PrivateIpAddress": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --secondary-private-ip-address-count (integer)
          The number of secondary private IPv4 addresses to assign to  a  net-
          work  interface.  When  you  specify  a number of secondary IPv4 ad-
          dresses, Amazon EC2 selects these IP addresses within  the  subnet's
          IPv4 CIDR range. You can't specify this option and specify more than
          one private IP address using privateIpAddresses .

          The number of IP addresses you can assign  to  a  network  interface
          varies  by instance type. For more information, see IP Addresses Per
          ENI Per Instance Type in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide
          .

       --ipv4-prefixes (list)

              Describes the IPv4 prefix option for a network interface.

              Ipv4Prefix -> (string)
                 The IPv4 prefix. For information, see Assigning  prefixes  to
                 Amazon  EC2  network interfaces in the Amazon Elastic Compute
                 Cloud User Guide .

          ]

       --ipv4-prefix-count (integer)
          The number of IPv4 prefixes that Amazon Web  Services  automatically
          assigns  to the network interface. You cannot use this option if you
          use the Ipv4 Prefixes option.

       --ipv6-prefixes (list)
          One or more IPv6 prefixes assigned to  the  network  interface.  You
          cannot use this option if you use the Ipv6PrefixCount option.

            }
            ...
          ]

       --ipv6-prefix-count (integer)
          The  number  of IPv6 prefixes that Amazon Web Services automatically
          assigns to the network interface. You cannot use this option if  you
          use the Ipv6Prefixes option.

       --interface-type (string)
          The type of network interface. The default is interface .

          The only supported values are efa and trunk .

                 The Valid Values lists all the resource  types  that  can  be
                 tagged.  However,  the  action you're using might not support
                 tagging all of these resource types. If you try to tag a  re-
                 source  type that is unsupported for the action you're using,
                 you'll get an error.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 Describes the IPv6 prefix.

                 Ipv6Prefix -> (string)
                     The IPv6 prefix.

          RequesterId -> (string)
              The alias or Amazon Web Services account ID of the principal  or

              The status of the network interface.

          SubnetId -> (string)
              The ID of the subnet.

          TagSet -> (list)
              Any tags assigned to the network interface.

              (structure)
                 Describes a tag.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the tag.

                     Constraints: Tag keys are  case-sensitive  and  accept  a
                     maximum  of  127  Unicode  characters. May not begin with
                     aws: .

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of the tag.

              bound traffic from the internet is dropped and you cannot assign
              an elastic IP address to the network interface. The network  in-
              terface  is  reachable  from peered VPCs and resources connected
              through a transit gateway, including on-premises networks.

          Ipv6Native -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether this is an IPv6 only network interface.
