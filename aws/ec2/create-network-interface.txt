NAME
       create-network-interface -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a network interface in the specified subnet.

       The number of IP addresses you can assign to a network interface varies
       by instance type.

       For more information about network interfaces, see Elastic network  in-
       terfaces in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

          You  can't specify IPv6 prefixes if you've specified one of the fol-
          lowing: a count of IPv6 prefixes,  specific  IPv6  addresses,  or  a
          count of IPv6 addresses.

          (structure)
              Describes the IPv4 prefix option for a network interface.

              Ipv6Prefix -> (string)
                 The IPv6 prefix.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Ipv6Prefix=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Ipv6Prefix": "string"

          or a count of IPv6 addresses.

       --interface-type (string)
          The type of network interface. The default is interface .

          If you specify efa-only , do not assign any IP addresses to the net-
          work  interface.  EFA-only  network interfaces do not support IP ad-
          dresses.

          The only supported values are interface , efa , efa-only , and trunk
          .

          Possible values:

          o efa

          o efa-only

          o branch

       --tag-specifications (list)
          The tags to apply to the new network interface.

          (structure)
              The  tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being cre-
              ated. When you specify a tag, you must specify the resource type
              to tag, otherwise the request will fail.

              NOTE:
                 The  Valid  Values  lists  all the resource types that can be
                 tagged. However, the action you're using  might  not  support
                 tagging  all of these resource types. If you try to tag a re-
                 source type that is unsupported for the action you're  using,
                 you'll get an error.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to tag on creation.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags to apply to the resource.

                 (structure)

       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request. For more information, see Ensuring idem-
          potency .

       --enable-primary-ipv6 | --no-enable-primary-ipv6 (boolean)
          If youre creating a network interface in a dual-stack  or  IPv6-only
          subnet,  you  have the option to assign a primary IPv6 IP address. A
          primary IPv6 address is an IPv6 GUA address associated with  an  ENI
          that you have enabled to use a primary IPv6 address. Use this option
          if the instance that this ENI will be attached to relies on its IPv6
          address  not changing. Amazon Web Services will automatically assign
          an IPv6 address associated with the ENI attached to your instance to
          be  the primary IPv6 address. Once you enable an IPv6 GUA address to
          be a primary IPv6, you cannot disable it. When you  enable  an  IPv6
          GUA  address  to  be a primary IPv6, the first IPv6 GUA will be made
          the primary IPv6 address until the instance  is  terminated  or  the
          network  interface  is detached. If you have multiple IPv6 addresses
          associated with an ENI attached to your instance and  you  enable  a
          primary IPv6 address, the first IPv6 GUA address associated with the
          ENI becomes the primary IPv6 address.

       --connection-tracking-specification (structure)
          A connection tracking specification for the network interface.

          TcpEstablishedTimeout -> (integer)
              Timeout (in seconds) for idle TCP connections in an  established
              state.  Min:  60 seconds. Max: 432000 seconds (5 days). Default:
              432000 seconds. Recommended: Less than 432000 seconds.

          UdpStreamTimeout -> (integer)
              Timeout (in seconds) for idle UDP flows  classified  as  streams
              which have seen more than one request-response transaction. Min:
              60 seconds. Max: 180 seconds (3 minutes). Default: 180 seconds.

          UdpTimeout -> (integer)
              Timeout (in seconds) for idle UDP flows that have  seen  traffic
              only in a single direction or a single request-response transac-
              tion. Min: 30 seconds. Max: 60 seconds. Default: 30 seconds.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TcpEstablishedTimeout=integer,UdpStreamTimeout=integer,UdpTimeout=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TcpEstablishedTimeout": integer,
            "UdpStreamTimeout": integer,
            "UdpTimeout": integer
          }

       --subnet-id (string)
          The ID of the subnet to associate with the network interface.

       --description (string)
          A description for the network interface.

       --private-ip-address (string)
          The primary private IPv4 address of the network  interface.  If  you
          don't  specify  an IPv4 address, Amazon EC2 selects one for you from
          the subnet's IPv4 CIDR range. If you specify an IP address, you can-
          not  indicate  any  IP  addresses specified in privateIpAddresses as
          primary (only one IP address can be designated as primary).

       --groups (list)
          The IDs of one or more security groups.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --private-ip-addresses (list)
          The private IPv4 addresses.

              face.

              Primary -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  the  private  IPv4 address is the primary
                 private IPv4 address. Only one IPv4 address can be designated
                 as primary.

       --secondary-private-ip-address-count (integer)
          The  number  of secondary private IPv4 addresses to assign to a net-
          work interface. When you specify a  number  of  secondary  IPv4  ad-
          dresses,  Amazon  EC2 selects these IP addresses within the subnet's
          IPv4 CIDR range. You can't specify this option and specify more than
          one private IP address using privateIpAddresses .

          You can't specify a count of private IPv4 addresses if you've speci-
          fied one of the following: specific private IPv4 addresses, specific
          IPv4 prefixes, or a count of IPv4 prefixes.

       --ipv6-addresses (list)
          The IPv6 addresses from the IPv6 CIDR block range of your subnet.

          You  can't  specify  IPv6  addresses  using this parameter if you've
          specified one of the following: a count of IPv6 addresses,  specific
          IPv6 prefixes, or a count of IPv6 prefixes.

          (structure)

              Ipv6Address -> (string)
                 The IPv6 address.

              IsPrimaryIpv6 -> (boolean)
                 Determines  if  an IPv6 address associated with a network in-
                 terface is the primary IPv6 address. When you enable an  IPv6
                 GUA  address to be a primary IPv6, the first IPv6 GUA will be
                 made the primary IPv6 address until the  instance  is  termi-
                 nated or the network interface is detached. For more informa-
                 tion, see RunInstances .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Ipv6Address=string,IsPrimaryIpv6=boolean ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Ipv6Address": "string",
              "IsPrimaryIpv6": true|false
            }
            ...
          ]

       --ipv6-address-count (integer)
          The number of IPv6 addresses to assign to a network interface.  Ama-
          zon  EC2  automatically  selects  the IPv6 addresses from the subnet
          range.

          You can't specify a count of IPv6 addresses using this parameter  if
          you've specified one of the following: specific IPv6 addresses, spe-
          cific IPv6 prefixes, or a count of IPv6 prefixes.

          If your subnet has the  AssignIpv6AddressOnCreation  attribute  set,
          you  can  override  that setting by specifying 0 as the IPv6 address
          count.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To specify an IPv4 address for a network interface

       The following create-network-interface example creates a network inter-
       face for the specified subnet with the specified primary IPv4 address.

              Any tags assigned to the network interface.

              (structure)
                 Describes a tag.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the tag.

                     Constraints: Tag keys are  case-sensitive  and  accept  a
                     maximum  of  127  Unicode  characters. May not begin with
                     aws: .
