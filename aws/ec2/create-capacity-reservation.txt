CREATE-CAPACITY-RESERVATION()                    CREATE-CAPACITY-RESERVATION()



NAME
       create-capacity-reservation -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new Capacity Reservation with the specified attributes.

       Capacity  Reservations  enable  you to reserve capacity for your Amazon
       EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for  any  duration.  This
       gives  you the flexibility to selectively add capacity reservations and
       still get the Regional RI discounts for that usage. By creating  Capac-
       ity  Reservations, you ensure that you always have access to Amazon EC2
       capacity when you need it, for as long as you need it. For more  infor-
       mation, see Capacity Reservations in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

       Your  request to create a Capacity Reservation could fail if Amazon EC2
       does not have sufficient capacity to fulfill the request. If  your  re-
       quest fails due to Amazon EC2 capacity constraints, either try again at
       a later time, try in  a  different  Availability  Zone,  or  request  a
       smaller  capacity  reservation.  If your application is flexible across
       instance types and sizes, try to create  a  Capacity  Reservation  with
       different instance attributes.

       Your  request  could  also  fail if the requested quantity exceeds your
       On-Demand Instance limit for the selected instance type.  If  your  re-
       quest  fails due to limit constraints, increase your On-Demand Instance
       limit for the required instance type and try again. For  more  informa-
       tion about increasing your instance limits, see Amazon EC2 Service Quo-
       tas in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request. For more information, see Ensure Idempo-
          tency .

       --instance-type (string)
          The instance type for which to reserve capacity. For  more  informa-
          tion, see Instance types in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

       --instance-platform (string)
          The type of operating system for which to reserve capacity.

          Possible values:

          o Linux/UNIX

          o Red Hat Enterprise Linux

          o RHEL with HA

          o RHEL with HA and SQL Server Standard

          o RHEL with HA and SQL Server Enterprise

       --availability-zone (string)
          The Availability Zone in which to create the Capacity Reservation.

       --availability-zone-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the  Availability  Zone in which to create the Capacity
          Reservation.

       --tenancy (string)
          Indicates the tenancy of the Capacity Reservation. A Capacity Reser-
          vation can have one of the following tenancy settings:

          o default  - The Capacity Reservation is created on hardware that is
            shared with other Amazon Web Services accounts.

          o dedicated - The Capacity Reservation is created  on  single-tenant
            hardware  that  is  dedicated  to a single Amazon Web Services ac-
            count.

          Possible values:

          o default

          o dedicated

       --instance-count (integer)
          The number of instances for which to reserve capacity.

          Valid range: 1 - 1000

       --ebs-optimized | --no-ebs-optimized (boolean)
          Indicates whether the Capacity  Reservation  supports  EBS-optimized
          instances. This optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon
          EBS and an optimized configuration stack to provide optimal I/O per-
          formance. This optimization isn't available with all instance types.
          Additional usage charges apply when  using  an  EBS-  optimized  in-
          stance.

       --ephemeral-storage | --no-ephemeral-storage (boolean)
          Deprecated.

       --end-date (timestamp)
          The  date and time at which the Capacity Reservation expires. When a
          Capacity Reservation expires, the reserved capacity is released  and
          you  can  no  longer launch instances into it. The Capacity Reserva-
          tion's state changes to expired when it reaches  its  end  date  and
          time.

          You  must  provide an EndDate value if EndDateType is limited . Omit
          EndDate if EndDateType is unlimited .

          If the EndDateType is limited , the  Capacity  Reservation  is  can-
          celled  within  an hour from the specified time. For example, if you
          specify 5/31/2019, 13:30:55, the Capacity Reservation is  guaranteed
          to end between 13:30:55 and 14:30:55 on 5/31/2019.

       --end-date-type (string)
          Indicates the way in which the Capacity Reservation ends. A Capacity
          Reservation can have one of the following end types:

          o unlimited - The Capacity Reservation remains active until you  ex-
            plicitly  cancel  it. Do not provide an EndDate if the EndDateType
            is unlimited .

          o limited - The Capacity  Reservation  expires  automatically  at  a
            specified  date and time. You must provide an EndDate value if the
            EndDateType value is limited .

          Possible values:

          o unlimited

          o limited

       --instance-match-criteria (string)
          Indicates the type of instance launches that the  Capacity  Reserva-
          tion accepts. The options include:

          o open  -  The  Capacity  Reservation  automatically matches all in-
            stances that have matching attributes  (instance  type,  platform,
            and  Availability  Zone).  Instances that have matching attributes
            run in the Capacity Reservation automatically  without  specifying
            any additional parameters.

          o targeted  -  The  Capacity Reservation only accepts instances that
            have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and  Availabil-
            ity  Zone),  and  explicitly target the Capacity Reservation. This
            ensures that only permitted instances can use the reserved  capac-
            ity.

          Default: open

          Possible values:

          o open

          o targeted

       --tag-specifications (list)
          The tags to apply to the Capacity Reservation during launch.

          (structure)
              The  tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being cre-
              ated.

                 The Valid Values lists all the resource  types  that  can  be
                 tagged.  However,  the  action you're using might not support
                 tagging all of these resource types. If you try to tag a  re-
                 source  type that is unsupported for the action you're using,
                 you'll get an error.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to tag on creation.

              Tags -> (list)

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept  a
                        maximum  of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and  accept
                        a maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --outpost-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost on which to create the
          Capacity Reservation.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To create a Capacity Reservation

       The following create-capacity-reservation example  creates  a  capacity
       reservation  in  the  eu-west-1a  Availability Zone, into which you can
       launch three t2.medium instances running a Linux/Unix operating system.
       By  default,  the  capacity  reservation  is created with open instance
       matching criteria and no support for ephemeral storage, and it  remains
       active until you manually cancel it.

          aws ec2 create-capacity-reservation \
              --availability-zone eu-west-1a \
              --instance-type t2.medium \
              --instance-platform Linux/UNIX \
              --instance-count 3

       Output:

          {
              "CapacityReservation": {
                  "CapacityReservationId": "cr-1234abcd56EXAMPLE ",
                  "EndDateType": "unlimited",
                  "AvailabilityZone": "eu-west-1a",
                  "InstanceMatchCriteria": "open",
                  "EphemeralStorage": false,
                  "CreateDate": "2019-08-16T09:27:35.000Z",
                  "AvailableInstanceCount": 3,
                  "InstancePlatform": "Linux/UNIX",
                  "TotalInstanceCount": 3,
                  "State": "active",
                  "Tenancy": "default",
                  "EbsOptimized": false,
                  "InstanceType": "t2.medium"
              }
          }

       Example  2: To create a Capacity Reservation that automatically ends at
       a specified date/time

       The following create-capacity-reservation example  creates  a  capacity
       reservation  in  the  eu-west-1a  Availability Zone, into which you can
       launch three m5.large instances running a Linux/Unix operating  system.
       This capacity reservation automatically ends on 08/31/2019 at 23:59:59.

          aws ec2 create-capacity-reservation \
              --availability-zone eu-west-1a \
              --instance-type m5.large \
              --instance-platform Linux/UNIX \
              --instance-count 3 \
              --end-date-type limited \
              --end-date 2019-08-31T23:59:59Z

       Output:

          {
              "CapacityReservation": {
                  "CapacityReservationId": "cr-1234abcd56EXAMPLE ",
                  "EndDateType": "limited",
                  "AvailabilityZone": "eu-west-1a",
                  "EndDate": "2019-08-31T23:59:59.000Z",
                  "InstanceMatchCriteria": "open",

                  "CreateDate": "2019-08-16T10:15:53.000Z",
                  "AvailableInstanceCount": 3,
                  "InstancePlatform": "Linux/UNIX",
                  "TotalInstanceCount": 3,
                  "State": "active",
                  "Tenancy": "default",
                  "EbsOptimized": false,
                  "InstanceType": "m5.large"
              }
          }

       Example  3: To create a Capacity Reservation that accepts only targeted
       instance launches

       The following create-capacity-reservation example  creates  a  capacity
       reservation that accepts only targeted instance launches.

          aws ec2 create-capacity-reservation \
              --availability-zone eu-west-1a \
              --instance-type m5.large \
              --instance-platform Linux/UNIX \
              --instance-count 3 \
              --instance-match-criteria targeted

       Output:

          {
              "CapacityReservation": {
                  "CapacityReservationId": "cr-1234abcd56EXAMPLE ",
                  "EndDateType": "unlimited",
                  "AvailabilityZone": "eu-west-1a",

OUTPUT
       CapacityReservation -> (structure)
          Information about the Capacity Reservation.

          CapacityReservationId -> (string)
              The ID of the Capacity Reservation.

          OwnerId -> (string)
              The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the Capacity
              Reservation.

          CapacityReservationArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Capacity Reservation.

          AvailabilityZoneId -> (string)
              The Availability Zone ID of the Capacity Reservation.

          InstanceType -> (string)
              The type of instance for which the Capacity Reservation reserves
              capacity.

          InstancePlatform -> (string)
              The type of operating system for which the Capacity  Reservation
              reserves capacity.

          AvailabilityZone -> (string)
              The Availability Zone in which the capacity is reserved.

          Tenancy -> (string)
              Indicates  the  tenancy  of the Capacity Reservation. A Capacity
              Reservation can have one of the following tenancy settings:

              o default - The Capacity Reservation is created on hardware that
                is shared with other Amazon Web Services accounts.

              o dedicated - The Capacity Reservation is created on single-ten-
                ant hardware that is dedicated to a single Amazon Web Services
                account.

          TotalInstanceCount -> (integer)
              The total number of instances for which the Capacity Reservation
              reserves capacity.

          AvailableInstanceCount -> (integer)
              The remaining capacity. Indicates the number of  instances  that
              can be launched in the Capacity Reservation.

          EbsOptimized -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether  the  Capacity Reservation supports EBS-opti-
              mized instances. This optimization provides dedicated throughput
              to  Amazon  EBS  and an optimized configuration stack to provide
              optimal I/O performance. This optimization isn't available  with
              all instance types. Additional usage charges apply when using an
              EBS- optimized instance.

          EphemeralStorage -> (boolean)
              Deprecated.

          State -> (string)
              The current state of the Capacity Reservation. A Capacity Reser-
              vation can be in one of the following states:

              o active  -  The Capacity Reservation is active and the capacity
                is available for your use.

              o expired - The Capacity Reservation  expired  automatically  at
                the  date and time specified in your request. The reserved ca-
                pacity is no longer available for your use.

              o cancelled - The Capacity Reservation was  cancelled.  The  re-
                served capacity is no longer available for your use.

              o pending  - The Capacity Reservation request was successful but
                the capacity provisioning is still pending.

              o failed - The Capacity Reservation request has  failed.  A  re-
                quest  might  fail due to invalid request parameters, capacity
                constraints, or instance limit  constraints.  Failed  requests
                are retained for 60 minutes.

          StartDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation was started.

          EndDate -> (timestamp)
              The  date  and  time  at which the Capacity Reservation expires.
              When a Capacity Reservation expires, the  reserved  capacity  is
              released and you can no longer launch instances into it. The Ca-
              pacity Reservation's state changes to expired  when  it  reaches
              its end date and time.

          EndDateType -> (string)
              Indicates  the way in which the Capacity Reservation ends. A Ca-
              pacity Reservation can have one of the following end types:

              o unlimited - The Capacity Reservation remains active until  you
                explicitly cancel it.

              o limited  - The Capacity Reservation expires automatically at a
                specified date and time.

          InstanceMatchCriteria -> (string)
              Indicates the type of instance launches that the Capacity Reser-
              vation accepts. The options include:

              o open  -  The  Capacity  Reservation accepts all instances that
                have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and  Avail-
                ability  Zone). Instances that have matching attributes launch
                into the Capacity Reservation automatically without specifying
                any additional parameters.

              o targeted  -  The  Capacity  Reservation only accepts instances
                that have matching attributes (instance  type,  platform,  and
                Availability  Zone), and explicitly target the Capacity Reser-
                vation. This ensures that only permitted instances can use the
                reserved capacity.

          CreateDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation was created.

          Tags -> (list)
              Any tags assigned to the Capacity Reservation.

              (structure)
                 Describes a tag.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the tag.

                     Constraints:  Tag  keys  are  case-sensitive and accept a
                     maximum of 127 Unicode characters.  May  not  begin  with
                     aws: .

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of the tag.

                     Constraints:  Tag  values are case-sensitive and accept a
                     maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

          OutpostArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost on which  the  Ca-
              pacity Reservation was created.

          CapacityReservationFleetId -> (string)
              The  ID  of the Capacity Reservation Fleet to which the Capacity
              Reservation belongs. Only valid for Capacity  Reservations  that
              were created by a Capacity Reservation Fleet.

          PlacementGroupArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster placement group in
              which the Capacity Reservation was created.  For  more  informa-
              tion,  see Capacity Reservations for cluster placement groups in
              the Amazon EC2 User Guide .
