CREATE-DEFAULT-SUBNET()                                CREATE-DEFAULT-SUBNET()



NAME
       create-default-subnet -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a default subnet with a size /20 IPv4 CIDR block in the speci-
       fied Availability Zone in your default VPC. You can have only  one  de-
       fault  subnet per Availability Zone. For more information, see Creating
       a default subnet in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-default-subnet
          --availability-zone <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--ipv6-native | --no-ipv6-native]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --availability-zone (string)
          The Availability Zone in which to create the default subnet.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --ipv6-native | --no-ipv6-native (boolean)
          Indicates whether to create an IPv6 only subnet. If you already have
          a default subnet for this Availability Zone, you must delete it  be-
          fore you can create an IPv6 only subnet.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 nets, an instance DNS name must be based on the instance IPv4
                 address.  For IPv6 only subnets, an instance DNS name must be
