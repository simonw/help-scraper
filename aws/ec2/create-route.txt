CREATE-ROUTE()                                                  CREATE-ROUTE()



NAME
       create-route -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a route in a route table within a VPC.

       You must specify one of the following targets: internet gateway or vir-
       tual private gateway, NAT instance, NAT gateway,  VPC  peering  connec-
       tion, network interface, egress-only internet gateway, or transit gate-
       way.

       When determining how to route traffic, we use the route with  the  most
       specific  match.  For example, traffic is destined for the IPv4 address
       192.0.2.3 , and the route table includes the following two IPv4 routes:

       o 192.0.2.0/24 (goes to some target A)

       o 192.0.2.0/28 (goes to some target B)

       Both routes apply to the traffic destined for 192.0.2.3 . However,  the
       second route in the list covers a smaller number of IP addresses and is
       therefore more specific, so we use that route  to  determine  where  to
       target the traffic.

       For more information about route tables, see Route tables in the Amazon
       Virtual Private Cloud User Guide .

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --destination-cidr-block (string)
          The IPv4 CIDR address block used for the destination match.  Routing
          decisions are based on the most specific match. We modify the speci-
          fied CIDR block to its canonical form; for example, if  you  specify
          100.68.0.18/18 , we modify it to 100.68.0.0/18 .

       --destination-ipv6-cidr-block (string)
          The  IPv6  CIDR  block used for the destination match. Routing deci-
          sions are based on the most specific match.

       --destination-prefix-list-id (string)
          The ID of a prefix list used for the destination match.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --vpc-endpoint-id (string)
          The  ID  of a VPC endpoint. Supported for Gateway Load Balancer end-
          points only.

       --egress-only-internet-gateway-id (string)
          [IPv6 traffic only] The ID of an egress-only internet gateway.

       --gateway-id (string)
          The ID of an internet gateway or virtual private gateway attached to
          your VPC.

       --instance-id (string)
          The  ID  of  a  NAT instance in your VPC. The operation fails if you
          specify an instance ID unless exactly one network interface  is  at-
          tached.

       --nat-gateway-id (string)
          [IPv4 traffic only] The ID of a NAT gateway.

       --transit-gateway-id (string)
          The ID of a transit gateway.

       --local-gateway-id (string)
          The ID of the local gateway.

       --carrier-gateway-id (string)
          The ID of the carrier gateway.

          You can only use this option when the VPC contains a subnet which is
          associated with a Wavelength Zone.

       --network-interface-id (string)
          The ID of a network interface.

       --route-table-id (string)
          The ID of the route table for the route.

       --vpc-peering-connection-id (string)
          The ID of a VPC peering connection.

       --core-network-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the core network.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a route

       This  example  creates a route for the specified route table. The route
       matches all IPv4 traffic (0.0.0.0/0) and routes it to the specified In-
       ternet gateway. If the command succeeds, no output is returned.

       Command:

          aws ec2 create-route --route-table-id rtb-22574640 --destination-cidr-block 0.0.0.0/0 --gateway-id igw-c0a643a9

       This  example  command creates a route in route table rtb-g8ff4ea2. The
       route matches traffic for the IPv4 CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16 and routes it
       to  VPC peering connection, pcx-111aaa22. This route enables traffic to
       be directed to the peer VPC in the VPC peering connection. If the  com-
       mand succeeds, no output is returned.

       Command:

          aws ec2 create-route --route-table-id rtb-g8ff4ea2 --destination-cidr-block 10.0.0.0/16 --vpc-peering-connection-id pcx-1a2b3c4d

       This  example creates a route in the specified route table that matches
       all IPv6 traffic (::/0) and routes it to the specified egress-only  In-
       ternet gateway.

       Command:

          aws ec2 create-route --route-table-id rtb-dce620b8 --destination-ipv6-cidr-block ::/0 --egress-only-internet-gateway-id eigw-01eadbd45ecd7943f

OUTPUT
       Return -> (boolean)
          Returns  true  if the request succeeds; otherwise, it returns an er-
          ror.
