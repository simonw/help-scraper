REGISTER-IMAGE()                                              REGISTER-IMAGE()



NAME
       register-image -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers  an  AMI. When you're creating an AMI, this is the final step
       you must complete before you can launch an instance from the  AMI.  For
       more information about creating AMIs, see Creating your own AMIs in the
       Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

       NOTE:
          For Amazon EBS-backed instances,  CreateImage creates and  registers
          the  AMI  in a single request, so you don't have to register the AMI
          yourself.

       If needed, you can deregister an AMI at any time. Any modifications you
       make  to an AMI backed by an instance store volume invalidates its reg-
       istration. If you make changes to an image, deregister the previous im-
       age and register the new image.
          Register a snapshot of a root device volume

       You can use RegisterImage to create an Amazon EBS-backed Linux AMI from
       a snapshot of a root device volume. You specify the  snapshot  using  a
       block  device mapping. You can't set the encryption state of the volume
       using the block device mapping. If the snapshot is  encrypted,  or  en-
       cryption by default is enabled, the root volume of an instance launched
       from the AMI is encrypted.

       For more information, see Create a Linux AMI from a  snapshot  and  Use
       encryption  with  Amazon  EBS-backed AMIs in the Amazon Elastic Compute
       Cloud User Guide .
          Amazon Web Services Marketplace product codes

       If any snapshots have Amazon Web Services  Marketplace  product  codes,
       they are copied to the new AMI.

       Windows  and some Linux distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux
       (RHEL) and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server  (SLES),  use  the  Amazon  EC2
       billing  product code associated with an AMI to verify the subscription
       status for package updates. To create a new AMI for  operating  systems
       that require a billing product code, instead of registering the AMI, do
       the following to preserve the billing product code association:

       o Launch an instance from an existing AMI  with  that  billing  product
         code.

       o Customize the instance.

       o Create an AMI from the instance using  CreateImage .

       If  you  purchase a Reserved Instance to apply to an On-Demand Instance
       that was launched from an AMI with a billing product  code,  make  sure
       that  the  Reserved  Instance has the matching billing product code. If
       you purchase a Reserved Instance without the matching  billing  product
       code,  the  Reserved  Instance will not be applied to the On-Demand In-
       stance. For information about how to obtain the  platform  details  and
       billing  information  of  an  AMI, see Understanding AMI billing in the
       Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --image-location (string)
          The full path to your AMI manifest in Amazon S3 storage. The  speci-
          fied  bucket  must have the aws-exec-read canned access control list
          (ACL) to ensure that it can be accessed by Amazon EC2. For more  in-
          formation,  see Canned ACLs in the Amazon S3 Service Developer Guide
          .

       --architecture (string)
          The architecture of the AMI.

          Default:  For  Amazon  EBS-backed  AMIs,   i386   .   For   instance
          store-backed AMIs, the architecture specified in the manifest file.

          Possible values:

          o i386

          o x86_64

          o arm64

          o x86_64_mac

       --block-device-mappings (list)
          The block device mapping entries.

          If  you  specify  an Amazon EBS volume using the ID of an Amazon EBS
          snapshot, you can't specify the encryption state of the volume.

          If you create an AMI on an Outpost, then all backing snapshots  must
          be  on the same Outpost or in the Region of that Outpost. AMIs on an
          Outpost that include local snapshots can be used to launch instances
          on  the  same  Outpost  only. For more information, Amazon EBS local
          snapshots on Outposts in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide
          .

          (structure)
              Describes  a block device mapping, which defines the EBS volumes
              and instance store volumes to attach to an instance at launch.

              DeviceName -> (string)
                 The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

              VirtualName -> (string)
                 The virtual device name (ephemeral N). Instance store volumes
                 are  numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2 avail-
                 able  instance  store  volumes  can  specify   mappings   for
                 ephemeral0  and ephemeral1 . The number of available instance
                 store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect
                 to the instance, you must mount the volume.

                 NVMe  instance store volumes are automatically enumerated and
                 assigned a device name. Including them in your  block  device
                 mapping has no effect.

                 Constraints:  For  M3  instances,  you  must specify instance
                 store volumes in the block device mapping for  the  instance.
                 When  you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance store
                 volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.

              Ebs -> (structure)
                 Parameters used to automatically set up EBS volumes when  the
                 instance is launched.

                 DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  whether  the EBS volume is deleted on instance
                     termination. For more information, see Preserving  Amazon
                     EBS  volumes  on  instance  termination in the Amazon EC2
                     User Guide .

                 Iops -> (integer)
                     The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3 ,
                     io1 , and io2 volumes, this represents the number of IOPS
                     that are provisioned for the  volume.  For  gp2  volumes,
                     this  represents  the  baseline performance of the volume
                     and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O  credits
                     for bursting.

                     The  following  are  the supported values for each volume
                     type:

                     o gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS

                     o io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                     o io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                     For io1 and io2 volumes, we guarantee  64,000  IOPS  only
                     for  Instances built on the Nitro System . Other instance
                     families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

                     This parameter is required for io1 and io2  volumes.  The
                     default  for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS. This parameter is
                     not supported for gp2 , st1 , sc1 , or standard volumes.

                 SnapshotId -> (string)
                     The ID of the snapshot.

                 VolumeSize -> (integer)
                     The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify  either
                     a  snapshot  ID  or a volume size. If you specify a snap-
                     shot, the default is the snapshot size. You can specify a
                     volume  size that is equal to or larger than the snapshot
                     size.

                     The following are the supported volumes  sizes  for  each
                     volume type:

                     o gp2 and gp3 :1-16,384

                     o io1 and io2 : 4-16,384

                     o st1 and sc1 : 125-16,384

                     o standard : 1-1,024

                 VolumeType -> (string)
                     The  volume  type.  For  more information, see Amazon EBS
                     volume types in the Amazon EC2 User Guide . If the volume
                     type  is  io1 or io2 , you must specify the IOPS that the
                     volume supports.

                 KmsKeyId -> (string)
                     Identifier (key ID, key alias, ID ARN, or alias ARN)  for
                     a  customer managed CMK under which the EBS volume is en-
                     crypted.

                     This parameter is only  supported  on  BlockDeviceMapping
                     objects  called  by RunInstances , RequestSpotFleet , and
                     RequestSpotInstances .

                 Throughput -> (integer)
                     The throughput that the volume supports, in MiB/s.

                     This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes.

                     Valid Range: Minimum value of 125. Maximum value of 1000.

                 OutpostArn -> (string)
                     The ARN of the Outpost on which the snapshot is stored.

                     This parameter is only  supported  on  BlockDeviceMapping
                     objects called by CreateImage .

                 Encrypted -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  whether  the encryption state of an EBS volume
                     is changed while being restored from a backing  snapshot.
                     The  effect  of  setting the encryption state to true de-
                     pends on the volume origin  (new  or  from  a  snapshot),
                     starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryp-
                     tion by default is enabled.  For  more  information,  see
                     Amazon EBS encryption in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

                     In  no  case  can you remove encryption from an encrypted
                     volume.

                     Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances  that
                     support  Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see
                     Supported instance types .

                     This parameter is not returned by  DescribeImageAttribute
                     .

              NoDevice -> (string)
                 To  omit the device from the block device mapping, specify an
                 empty string. When this property is specified, the device  is
                 removed  from  the block device mapping regardless of the as-
                 signed value.

       --description (string)
          A description for your AMI.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-

       --ena-support | --no-ena-support (boolean)
          Set  to  true to enable enhanced networking with ENA for the AMI and
          any instances that you launch from the AMI.

          This option is supported only for HVM AMIs. Specifying  this  option
          with a PV AMI can make instances launched from the AMI unreachable.

       --kernel-id (string)
          The ID of the kernel.

       --name (string)
          A name for your AMI.

          Constraints: 3-128 alphanumeric characters, parentheses (()), square
          brackets ([]), spaces ( ), periods (.),  slashes  (/),  dashes  (-),
          single quotes ('), at-signs (@), or underscores(_)

       --billing-products (list)
          The  billing product codes. Your account must be authorized to spec-
          ify billing product codes. Otherwise, you can  use  the  Amazon  Web
          Services Marketplace to bill for the use of an AMI.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --ramdisk-id (string)
          The ID of the RAM disk.

       --root-device-name (string)
          The device name of the root device volume (for example, /dev/sda1 ).

       --sriov-net-support (string)
          Set  to  simple  to  enable enhanced networking with the Intel 82599
          Virtual Function interface for the AMI and any  instances  that  you
          launch from the AMI.

          There is no way to disable sriovNetSupport at this time.

          This  option  is supported only for HVM AMIs. Specifying this option
          with a PV AMI can make instances launched from the AMI unreachable.

       --virtualization-type (string)
          The type of virtualization (hvm | paravirtual ).

          Default: paravirtual

       --boot-mode (string)
          The boot mode of the AMI. For more information, see  Boot  modes  in
          the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o legacy-bios

          o uefi

       --tpm-support (string)
          Set  to  v2.0  to  enable Trusted Platform Module (TPM) support. For
          more information, see NitroTPM in the Amazon Elastic  Compute  Cloud
          User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o v2.0

       --uefi-data (string)
          Base64  representation  of  the non-volatile UEFI variable store. To
          retrieve the UEFI data, use the GetInstanceUefiData command. You can
          inspect  and  modify the UEFI data by using the python-uefivars tool
          on GitHub. For more information, see UEFI Secure Boot in the  Amazon
          Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To register an AMI using a manifest file

       The following register-image example registers an AMI using the  speci-
       fied manifest file in Amazon S3.

          aws ec2 register-image \
              --name my-image \
              --image-location my-s3-bucket/myimage/image.manifest.xml

       Output:

          {
              "ImageId": "ami-1234567890EXAMPLE"
          }

       For more information, see Amazon Machine Images (AMI) in the Amazon EC2
       User Guide.

       Example 2: To register an AMI using a snapshot of a root device

       The following register-image example registers an AMI using the  speci-
       fied  snapshot of an EBS root volume as device /dev/xvda. The block de-
       vice mapping also includes an  empty  100  GiB  EBS  volume  as  device
       /dev/xvdf.

          aws ec2 register-image \
              --name my-image \
              --root-device-name /dev/xvda \
              --block-device-mappings DeviceName=/dev/xvda,Ebs={SnapshotId=snap-0db2cf683925d191f} DeviceName=/dev/xvdf,Ebs={VolumeSize=100}

       Output:

          {
              "ImageId": "ami-1a2b3c4d5eEXAMPLE"
          }

       For more information, see Amazon Machine Images (AMI) in the Amazon EC2
       User Guide.
