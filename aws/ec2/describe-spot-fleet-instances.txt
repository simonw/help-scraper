NAME
       describe-spot-fleet-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the running instances for the specified Spot Fleet.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-spot-fleet-instances  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: ActiveInstances

SYNOPSIS
            describe-spot-fleet-instances
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --spot-fleet-request-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --spot-fleet-request-id (string)
          The ID of the Spot Fleet request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe the Spot Instances associated with a Spot fleet

       This example command lists the Spot instances associated with the spec-
       ified Spot fleet.

       Command:

          aws ec2 describe-spot-fleet-instances --spot-fleet-request-id sfr-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
            "ActiveInstances": [
                {
                    "InstanceId": "i-1234567890abcdef0",
                    "InstanceType": "m3.medium",
                    "SpotInstanceRequestId": "sir-08b93456"
                },
                ...
            ],
            "SpotFleetRequestId": "sfr-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE"
          }

OUTPUT
       ActiveInstances -> (list)
          The running instances. This list is refreshed periodically and might
          be out of date.

          (structure)
              Describes a running instance in a Spot Fleet.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the instance.

              InstanceType -> (string)
                 The instance type.

              SpotInstanceRequestId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Spot Instance request.

              InstanceHealth -> (string)
                 The health status of the instance. If the  status  of  either
                 the  instance  status check or the system status check is im-
                 paired , the health status of the  instance  is  unhealthy  .
                 Otherwise, the health status is healthy .

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token  required to retrieve the next set of results. This value
          is null when there are no more results to return.

       SpotFleetRequestId -> (string)
          The ID of the Spot Fleet request.
