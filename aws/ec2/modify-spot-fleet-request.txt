NAME
       modify-spot-fleet-request -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies the specified Spot Fleet request.

       You can only modify a Spot Fleet request of type maintain .

       While  the Spot Fleet request is being modified, it is in the modifying
       state.

       To scale up your Spot Fleet, increase its  target  capacity.  The  Spot
       Fleet  launches  the additional Spot Instances according to the alloca-
       tion strategy for the Spot Fleet request. If the allocation strategy is
       lowestPrice , the Spot Fleet launches instances using the Spot Instance
       pool with the lowest price. If the allocation strategy is diversified ,
       the  Spot  Fleet  distributes  the  instances  across the Spot Instance
       pools. If the allocation strategy is  capacityOptimized  ,  Spot  Fleet
       launches  instances  from Spot Instance pools with optimal capacity for
       the number of instances that are launching.

       To scale down your Spot Fleet, decrease its target capacity. First, the
       Spot  Fleet cancels any open requests that exceed the new target capac-
       ity. You can request that the Spot Fleet terminate Spot Instances until
       the size of the fleet no longer exceeds the new target capacity. If the
       allocation strategy is lowestPrice , the Spot Fleet terminates the  in-
       stances  with the highest price per unit. If the allocation strategy is
       capacityOptimized , the Spot Fleet terminates the instances in the Spot
       Instance pools that have the least available Spot Instance capacity. If
       the allocation strategy is diversified , the Spot Fleet terminates  in-
       stances  across the Spot Instance pools. Alternatively, you can request
       that the Spot Fleet keep the fleet at its current size, but not replace
       any Spot Instances that are interrupted or that you terminate manually.

       If you are finished with your Spot Fleet for now, but will use it again
       later, you can set the target capacity to 0.

OPTIONS
       --excess-capacity-termination-policy (string)
          Indicates whether running Spot Instances should be terminated if the
          target  capacity  of  the  Spot Fleet request is decreased below the
          current size of the Spot Fleet.

          Possible values:

          o noTermination

          o default

       --launch-template-configs (list)
          The launch template and overrides. You can only use  this  parameter
          if  you specified a launch template (LaunchTemplateConfigs ) in your
          Spot Fleet request. If you specified  LaunchSpecifications  in  your
          Spot Fleet request, then omit this parameter.

          (structure)
              Describes a launch template and overrides.

              LaunchTemplateSpecification -> (structure)
                 The launch template.

                 LaunchTemplateId -> (string)
                     The  ID  of  the launch template. If you specify the tem-
                     plate ID, you can't specify the template name.

                 LaunchTemplateName -> (string)
                     The name of the launch template. If you specify the  tem-
                     plate name, you can't specify the template ID.

                 Version -> (string)
                     The launch template version number, $Latest , or $Default
                     . You must specify a value, otherwise the request fails.

                     If the value is $Latest , Amazon EC2 uses the latest ver-
                     sion of the launch template.

                     If  the  value  is $Default , Amazon EC2 uses the default
                     version of the launch template.

              Overrides -> (list)
                 Any parameters that you specify override the same  parameters
                 in the launch template.

                 (structure)
                     Describes overrides for a launch template.

                     InstanceType -> (string)
                        The instance type.

                     SpotPrice -> (string)
                        The  maximum  price per unit hour that you are willing
                        to pay for a Spot Instance.

                     SubnetId -> (string)
                        The ID of the subnet in which to launch the instances.

                     AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                        The Availability Zone  in  which  to  launch  the  in-
                        stances.

                     WeightedCapacity -> (double)
                        The number of units provided by the specified instance
                        type.

                     Priority -> (double)
                        The priority for the  launch  template  override.  The
                        highest priority is launched first.

                        If  OnDemandAllocationStrategy is set to prioritized ,
                        Spot Fleet uses priority  to  determine  which  launch
                        template override to use first in fulfilling On-Demand
                        capacity.

                        If the Spot AllocationStrategy is set to capacityOpti-
                        mizedPrioritized  ,  Spot  Fleet  uses  priority  on a
                        best-effort basis to determine which  launch  template
                        override to use in fulfilling Spot capacity, but opti-
                        mizes for capacity first.

                        Valid values are whole numbers starting  at  0  .  The
                        lower  the number, the higher the priority. If no num-
                        ber is set, the launch template override has the  low-
                        est  priority.  You can set the same priority for dif-
                        ferent launch template overrides.

                     InstanceRequirements -> (structure)
                        The instance requirements. When you  specify  instance
                        requirements,  Amazon EC2 will identify instance types
                        with the provided  requirements,  and  then  use  your
                        On-Demand and Spot allocation strategies to launch in-
                        stances from these instance types, in the same way  as
                        when you specify a list of instance types.

                        NOTE:
                            If  you  specify  InstanceRequirements , you can't
                            specify InstanceTypes .

                        VCpuCount -> (structure)
                            The minimum and maximum number of vCPUs.

                            Min -> (integer)
                               The minimum number of vCPUs. If the value is  0
                               , there is no minimum limit.

                            Max -> (integer)
                               The  maximum number of vCPUs. If this parameter
                               is not specified, there is no maximum limit.

                        MemoryMiB -> (structure)
                            The minimum and maximum amount of memory, in MiB.

                            Min -> (integer)
                               The minimum amount of memory, in MiB.  If  this
                               parameter is not specified, there is no minimum
                               limit.

                            Max -> (integer)
                               The maximum amount of memory, in MiB.  If  this
                               parameter is not specified, there is no maximum
                               limit.

                        CpuManufacturers -> (list)
                            The CPU manufacturers to include.

                            o For instance types with Intel CPUs, specify  in-
                              tel .

                            o For instance types with AMD CPUs, specify amd .

                            o For  instance  types  with  Amazon  Web Services
                              CPUs, specify amazon-web-services .

                            NOTE:
                               Don't confuse the CPU manufacturer with the CPU
                               architecture. Instances will be launched with a
                               compatible CPU architecture based on the Amazon
                               Machine  Image  (AMI)  that you specify in your
                               launch template.

                            Default: Any manufacturer

                            (string)

                        MemoryGiBPerVCpu -> (structure)
                            The minimum and maximum amount of memory per vCPU,
                            in GiB.

                            Default: No minimum or maximum limits

                            Min -> (double)
                               The  minimum amount of memory per vCPU, in GiB.
                               If this parameter is not specified, there is no
                               minimum limit.

                            Max -> (double)
                               The  maximum amount of memory per vCPU, in GiB.
                               If this parameter is not specified, there is no
                               maximum limit.

                        ExcludedInstanceTypes -> (list)
                            The instance types to exclude. You can use strings
                            with one or more wild cards, represented by an as-
                            terisk (* ), to exclude an instance type, size, or
                            generation. The following are examples: m5.8xlarge
                            , c5*.* , m5a.* , r* , *3* .

                            For  example,  if you specify c5* ,Amazon EC2 will
                            exclude the entire C5 instance family,  which  in-
                            cludes  all  C5a  and  C5n  instance types. If you
                            specify m5a.* , Amazon EC2 will  exclude  all  the
                            M5a  instance  types,  but  not  the  M5n instance
                            types.

                            Default: No excluded instance types

                            (string)

                        InstanceGenerations -> (list)
                            Indicates whether current or  previous  generation
                            instance  types  are included. The current genera-
                            tion instance types are recommended for use.  Cur-
                            rent  generation  instance types are typically the
                            latest two to three generations in  each  instance
                            family.  For  more information, see Instance types
                            in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

                            For current  generation  instance  types,  specify
                            current .

                            For  previous  generation  instance types, specify
                            previous .

                            Default: Current and previous generation  instance
                            types

                            (string)

                        SpotMaxPricePercentageOverLowestPrice -> (integer)
                            The price protection threshold for Spot Instances.
                            This is the maximum youll pay for a Spot Instance,
                            expressed as a percentage above the cheapest M, C,
                            or R instance type with your specified attributes.
                            When  Amazon  EC2 selects instance types with your
                            attributes,  it  excludes  instance  types  priced
                            above your threshold.

                            The parameter accepts an integer, which Amazon EC2
                            interprets as a percentage.

                            To turn  off  price  protection,  specify  a  high
                            value, such as 999999 .

                            This    parameter    is    not    supported    for
                            GetSpotPlacementScores                         and
                            GetInstanceTypesFromInstanceRequirements .

                            NOTE:
                               If  you  set  TargetCapacityUnitType to vcpu or
                               memory-mib , the price protection threshold  is
                               applied  based  on  the  per-vCPU or per-memory
                               price instead of the per-instance price.

                            Default: 100

                        OnDemandMaxPricePercentageOverLowestPrice -> (integer)
                            The price protection threshold for  On-Demand  In-
                            stances.  This  is  the  maximum  youll pay for an
                            On-Demand  Instance,  expressed  as  a  percentage
                            above  the  cheapest M, C, or R instance type with
                            your specified attributes. When Amazon EC2 selects
                            instance  types  with your attributes, it excludes
                            instance types priced above your threshold.

                            The parameter accepts an integer, which Amazon EC2
                            interprets as a percentage.

                            To  turn  off  price  protection,  specify  a high
                            value, such as 999999 .

                            This    parameter    is    not    supported    for
                            GetSpotPlacementScores                         and
                            GetInstanceTypesFromInstanceRequirements .

                            NOTE:
                               If you set TargetCapacityUnitType  to  vcpu  or
                               memory-mib  , the price protection threshold is
                               applied based on  the  per-vCPU  or  per-memory
                               price instead of the per-instance price.

                            Default: 20

                        BareMetal -> (string)

                            Default: excluded

                        BurstablePerformance -> (string)
                            Indicates whether burstable performance T instance
                            types are included,  excluded,  or  required.  For

       --spot-fleet-request-id (string)
          The ID of the Spot Fleet request.

       --target-capacity (integer)
          The size of the fleet.

       --on-demand-target-capacity (integer)
          The number of On-Demand Instances in the fleet.

       --context (string)
          Reserved.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To modify a Spot fleet request

       This example command updates the target capacity of the specified  Spot
       fleet request.

       Command:

          aws ec2 modify-spot-fleet-request --target-capacity 20 --spot-fleet-request-id sfr-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "Return": true
          }

       This  example  command  decreases  the target capacity of the specified
       Spot fleet request without terminating any Spot Instances as a result.

       Command:

          aws ec2 modify-spot-fleet-request --target-capacity 10 --excess-capacity-termination-policy NoTermination --spot-fleet-request-ids sfr-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "Return": true
          }

OUTPUT
       Return -> (boolean)
          If the request succeeds, the response returns true . If the  request
          fails,  no response is returned, and instead an error message is re-
          turned.
