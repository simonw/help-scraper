REBOOT-INSTANCES()                                          REBOOT-INSTANCES()



NAME
       reboot-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Requests  a  reboot of the specified instances. This operation is asyn-
       chronous; it only queues a request to reboot the  specified  instances.
       The  operation  succeeds  if the instances are valid and belong to you.
       Requests to reboot terminated instances are ignored.

       If an instance does not cleanly shut down within a few minutes,  Amazon
       EC2 performs a hard reboot.

       For  more  information  about  troubleshooting, see Troubleshoot an un-
       reachable instance in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            reboot-instances
          --instance-ids <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-ids (list)
          The instance IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
