CREATE-SNAPSHOT()                                            CREATE-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       create-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a snapshot of an EBS volume and stores it in Amazon S3. You can
       use snapshots for backups, to make copies of EBS volumes, and  to  save
       data before shutting down an instance.

       You  can create snapshots of volumes in a Region and volumes on an Out-
       post. If you create a snapshot of a volume in a  Region,  the  snapshot
       must  be stored in the same Region as the volume. If you create a snap-
       shot of a volume on an Outpost, the snapshot can be stored on the  same
       Outpost as the volume, or in the Region for that Outpost.

       When a snapshot is created, any Amazon Web Services Marketplace product
       codes that are associated with the source volume are propagated to  the
       snapshot.

       You  can take a snapshot of an attached volume that is in use. However,
       snapshots only capture data that has been written to  your  Amazon  EBS
       volume  at  the time the snapshot command is issued; this might exclude
       any data that has been cached by any applications or the operating sys-
       tem.  If  you  can  pause any file systems on the volume long enough to
       take a snapshot, your snapshot should be complete. However, if you can-
       not  pause all file writes to the volume, you should unmount the volume
       from within the instance, issue the snapshot command, and then  remount
       the  volume  to  ensure a consistent and complete snapshot. You may re-
       mount and use your volume while the snapshot status is pending .

       When you create a snapshot for an EBS volume that serves as a root  de-
       vice,  we  recommend that you stop the instance before taking the snap-
       shot.

       Snapshots that are taken from encrypted volumes are  automatically  en-
       crypted. Volumes that are created from encrypted snapshots are also au-
       tomatically encrypted. Your encrypted volumes and any associated  snap-
       shots always remain protected.

       You  can  tag your snapshots during creation. For more information, see
       Tag your Amazon EC2 resources in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

       For more information, see Amazon EBS and Amazon EBS encryption  in  the
       Amazon EBS User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          A description for the snapshot.

       --outpost-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost on which to create a
          local snapshot.

          o To create a snapshot of a volume in a Region, omit this parameter.
            The snapshot is created in the same Region as the volume.

          o To create a snapshot of a volume on an Outpost and store the snap-
            shot in the Region, omit this parameter. The snapshot  is  created
            in the Region for the Outpost.

          o To create a snapshot of a volume on an Outpost and store the snap-
            shot on an Outpost, specify the ARN of  the  destination  Outpost.
            The snapshot must be created on the same Outpost as the volume.

          For  more information, see Create local snapshots from volumes on an
          Outpost in the Amazon EBS User Guide .

       --volume-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon EBS volume.

       --tag-specifications (list)
          The tags to apply to the snapshot during creation.

          (structure)
              The tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being  cre-
              ated. When you specify a tag, you must specify the resource type
              to tag, otherwise the request will fail.

              NOTE:
                 The Valid Values lists all the resource  types  that  can  be
                 tagged.  However,  the  action you're using might not support
                 tagging all of these resource types. If you try to tag a  re-
                 source  type that is unsupported for the action you're using,
                 you'll get an error.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to tag on creation.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags to apply to the resource.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept  a
                        maximum  of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and  accept
                        a maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a snapshot

       This example command creates a snapshot of the volume with a volume  ID
       of  vol-1234567890abcdef0 and a short description to identify the snap-
       shot.

       Command:

          aws ec2 create-snapshot --volume-id vol-1234567890abcdef0 --description "This is my root volume snapshot"

       Output:

          {
              "Description": "This is my root volume snapshot",
              "Tags": [],
              "Encrypted": false,
              "VolumeId": "vol-1234567890abcdef0",
              "State": "pending",
              "VolumeSize": 8,
              "StartTime": "2018-02-28T21:06:01.000Z",
              "Progress": "",
              "OwnerId": "012345678910",
              "SnapshotId": "snap-066877671789bd71b"
          }

       To create a snapshot with tags

       This example command creates a snapshot  and  applies  two  tags:  pur-
       pose=prod and costcenter=123.

       Command:

          aws ec2 create-snapshot --volume-id vol-1234567890abcdef0 --description 'Prod backup' --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=snapshot,Tags=[{Key=purpose,Value=prod},{Key=costcenter,Value=123}]'

       Output:

          {
              "Description": "Prod backup",
              "Tags": [
                  {
                      "Value": "prod",
                      "Key": "purpose"
                  },
                  {
                      "Value": "123",
                      "Key": "costcenter"
                  }
               ],
               "Encrypted": false,
               "VolumeId": "vol-1234567890abcdef0",
               "State": "pending",
               "VolumeSize": 8,
               "StartTime": "2018-02-28T21:06:06.000Z",
               "Progress": "",
               "OwnerId": "012345678910",
               "SnapshotId": "snap-09ed24a70bc19bbe4"
           }

OUTPUT
       DataEncryptionKeyId -> (string)
          The data encryption key identifier for the snapshot. This value is a
          unique identifier that corresponds to the data encryption  key  that
          was  used  to  encrypt the original volume or snapshot copy. Because
          data encryption keys are inherited by  volumes  created  from  snap-
          shots,  and  vice versa, if snapshots share the same data encryption
          key identifier, then they belong to the  same  volume/snapshot  lin-
          eage. This parameter is only returned by  DescribeSnapshots .

       Description -> (string)
          The description for the snapshot.

       Encrypted -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether the snapshot is encrypted.

       KmsKeyId -> (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key that was used to pro-
          tect the volume encryption key for the parent volume.

       OwnerId -> (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns  the  EBS  snap-
          shot.

       Progress -> (string)
          The progress of the snapshot, as a percentage.

       SnapshotId -> (string)
          The  ID  of the snapshot. Each snapshot receives a unique identifier
          when it is created.

       StartTime -> (timestamp)
          The time stamp when the snapshot was initiated.

       State -> (string)
          The snapshot state.

       StateMessage -> (string)
          Encrypted Amazon EBS snapshots are copied asynchronously. If a snap-
          shot  copy  operation  fails (for example, if the proper KMS permis-
          sions are not obtained) this field displays error state  details  to
          help you diagnose why the error occurred. This parameter is only re-
          turned by  DescribeSnapshots .

       VolumeId -> (string)
          The ID of the volume that was used to create the snapshot. Snapshots
          created by the  CopySnapshot action have an arbitrary volume ID that
          should not be used for any purpose.

       VolumeSize -> (integer)
          The size of the volume, in GiB.

       OwnerAlias -> (string)
          The Amazon Web Services owner alias, from an Amazon-maintained  list
          (amazon  ).  This is not the user-configured Amazon Web Services ac-
          count alias set using the IAM console.

       OutpostArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the Outpost on which the snapshot is stored. For more in-
          formation,  see Amazon EBS local snapshots on Outposts in the Amazon
          EBS User Guide .

       Tags -> (list)
          Any tags assigned to the snapshot.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

                 Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a maximum
                 of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with aws: .

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

                 Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and accept a maxi-
                 mum of 256 Unicode characters.

       StorageTier -> (string)
          The storage tier in which the snapshot is stored. standard indicates
          that  the  snapshot  is stored in the standard snapshot storage tier
          and that it is ready for use. archive indicates that the snapshot is
          currently  archived  and  that  it must be restored before it can be
          used.

       RestoreExpiryTime -> (timestamp)
          Only for archived snapshots that are temporarily restored. Indicates
          the date and time when a temporarily restored snapshot will be auto-
          matically re-archived.

       SseType -> (string)
          Reserved for future use.
