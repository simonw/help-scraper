NAME
       describe-spot-instance-requests -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified Spot Instance requests.

       You  can  use  DescribeSpotInstanceRequests  to find a running Spot In-
       stance by examining the response. If the status of the Spot Instance is
       fulfilled  ,  the  instance ID appears in the response and contains the
       identifier   of   the   instance.   Alternatively,    you    can    use
       DescribeInstances  with  a  filter  to look for instances where the in-
       stance lifecycle is spot .

       We recommend that you set MaxResults to a value between 5 and  1000  to
       limit  the number of results returned. This paginates the output, which
       makes the list more manageable and returns the results faster.  If  the
       list  of results exceeds your MaxResults value, then that number of re-
       sults is returned along with a NextToken value that can be passed to  a
       subsequent DescribeSpotInstanceRequests request to retrieve the remain-
       ing results.

       Spot Instance requests are deleted four hours after they  are  canceled
       and their instances are terminated.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-spot-instance-requests  is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: SpotInstanceRequests

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --spot-instance-request-ids (list)
          One or more Spot Instance request IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       Example 2: To describe Spot Instance requests based on filters

       The  following  describe-spot-instance-requests example uses filters to
       scope the results to Spot Instance requests with the specified instance
       type  in  the specified Availability Zone. The example uses the --query
       parameter to display only the instance IDs.

          aws ec2 describe-spot-instance-requests \
              --filters Name=launch.instance-type,Values=m3.medium Name=launched-availability-zone,Values=us-east-2a \
              --query "SpotInstanceRequests[*].[InstanceId]" \
              --output text

       Output:

          i-057750d42936e468a
          i-001efd250faaa6ffa
          i-027552a73f021f3bd
          ...

       For additional examples using filters, see Listing and  filtering  your
       resources in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

       Example 3: To describe Spot Instance requests based on tags

       The  following describe-spot-instance-requests example uses tag filters
       to scope the results to  Spot  Instance  requests  that  have  the  tag
       cost-center=cc123.

          aws ec2 describe-spot-instance-requests \
              --filters Name=tag:cost-center,Values=cc123

                        Describes  a  block  device mapping, which defines the
                        EBS volumes and instance store volumes to attach to an
                        instance at launch.

                        DeviceName -> (string)
                            The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

                        VirtualName -> (string)
                            The  virtual  device  name (ephemeral N). Instance
                            store volumes are numbered starting from 0. An in-
                            stance  type  with 2 available instance store vol-
                            umes  can  specify  mappings  for  ephemeral0  and
                            ephemeral1  .  The  number  of  available instance
                            store volumes depends on the instance type.  After
                            you  connect  to  the instance, you must mount the
                            volume.

                            NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enu-
                            merated and assigned a device name. Including them
                            in your block device mapping has no effect.

                            Constraints: For M3 instances,  you  must  specify
                            instance store volumes in the block device mapping
                            for the instance. When you launch an M3  instance,
                            we  ignore any instance store volumes specified in
                            the block device mapping for the AMI.

                        Ebs -> (structure)
                            Parameters used to automatically set up  EBS  vol-
                            umes when the instance is launched.

                            DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                               Indicates  whether the EBS volume is deleted on
                               instance termination. For more information, see
                               Preserving  Amazon EBS volumes on instance ter-

                            Iops -> (integer)
                               The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS).
                               For  gp3  ,  io1 , and io2 volumes, this repre-
                               sents the number of IOPS that  are  provisioned
                               for  the  volume.  For gp2 volumes, this repre-
                               sents the baseline performance  of  the  volume
                               and  the  rate  at which the volume accumulates
                               I/O credits for bursting.

                               The following are the supported values for each
                               volume type:

                               o gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS

                               o io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                               o io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                               For  io1  and  io2 volumes, we guarantee 64,000
                               IOPS only for Instances built on the Nitro Sys-
                               tem . Other instance families guarantee perfor-
                               mance up to 32,000 IOPS.

                               This parameter is required for io1 and io2 vol-
                               umes.  The  default  for  gp3  volumes is 3,000
                               IOPS. This parameter is not supported for gp2 ,
                               st1 , sc1 , or standard volumes.

                            SnapshotId -> (string)
                               The ID of the snapshot.

                            VolumeSize -> (integer)
                               The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must spec-
                               ify either a snapshot ID or a volume  size.  If
                               you  specify  a  snapshot,  the  default is the
                               snapshot size. You can specify  a  volume  size
                               that  is  equal  to or larger than the snapshot
                               size.

                               The following are the supported  volumes  sizes
                               for each volume type:

                               o gp2 and gp3 :1-16,384

                               o io1 and io2 : 4-16,384

                               o st1 and sc1 : 125-16,384

                               o standard : 1-1,024

                            VolumeType -> (string)
                               The  volume  type.  For  more  information, see
                               Amazon EBS volume types in the Amazon EC2  User
                               Guide  . If the volume type is io1 or io2 , you
                               must specify the IOPS that the volume supports.

                            KmsKeyId -> (string)
                               Identifier (key ID, key alias, ID ARN, or alias
                               ARN) for a customer managed CMK under which the
                               EBS volume is encrypted.

                               This parameter is only  supported  on  BlockDe-
                               viceMapping  objects  called  by RunInstances ,
                               RequestSpotFleet , and RequestSpotInstances .

                            Throughput -> (integer)
                               The throughput that  the  volume  supports,  in
                               MiB/s.

                               This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes.

                               Valid  Range:  Minimum  value  of  125. Maximum
                               value of 1000.

                            OutpostArn -> (string)
                               The ARN of the Outpost on which the snapshot is
                               stored.

                            Encrypted -> (boolean)
                               Indicates  whether  the  encryption state of an
                               EBS volume is changed while being restored from
                               a  backing  snapshot. The effect of setting the
                               encryption state to true depends on the  volume
                               origin  (new  or from a snapshot), starting en-
                               cryption state, ownership, and whether  encryp-
                               tion  by  default is enabled. For more informa-
                               tion, see Amazon EBS encryption in  the  Amazon
                               EC2 User Guide .

                               In  no  case  can you remove encryption from an
                               encrypted volume.

                               Encrypted volumes can only be attached  to  in-
                               stances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For
                               more information, see Supported instance  types
                               .

                               This parameter is not returned by .

                        NoDevice -> (string)
                            To  omit the device from the block device mapping,
                            specify an empty string.  When  this  property  is
                            specified,  the  device  is removed from the block
                            device mapping regardless of the assigned value.

                 EbsOptimized -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether the instance is optimized for EBS  I/O.
                     This optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon
                     EBS and an optimized configuration stack to provide opti-
                     mal  EBS  I/O performance. This optimization isn't avail-
                     able with all instance types.  Additional  usage  charges
                     apply when using an EBS Optimized instance.

                     Default: false

                 IamInstanceProfile -> (structure)
                     The IAM instance profile.

                     Arn -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the instance pro-
                        file.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the instance profile.

                 ImageId -> (string)
                     The ID of the AMI.

                 InstanceType -> (string)
                     The instance type.

                 KernelId -> (string)
                     The ID of the kernel.

                 KeyName -> (string)
                     The name of the key pair.

                 NetworkInterfaces -> (list)
                     One or more network interfaces. If you specify a  network
                     interface, you must specify subnet IDs and security group
                     IDs using the network interface.

                     (structure)
                        Describes a network interface.

                        AssociatePublicIpAddress -> (boolean)
                            Indicates whether to assign a public IPv4  address
                            to  an instance you launch in a VPC. The public IP
                            address can only be assigned to a  network  inter-
                            face  for  eth0, and can only be assigned to a new
                            network interface, not an existing one. You cannot
                            specify more than one network interface in the re-
                            quest. If launching into a default subnet, the de-
                            fault value is true .

                        DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                            If set to true , the interface is deleted when the
                            instance is terminated. You can specify true  only
                            if creating a new network interface when launching
                            an instance.

                        Description -> (string)
                            The description of the network interface.  Applies
                            only  if creating a network interface when launch-
                            ing an instance.

                        DeviceIndex -> (integer)
                            The position of the network interface in  the  at-
                            tachment  order. A primary network interface has a
                            device index of 0.

                            If you specify a network interface when  launching
                            an instance, you must specify the device index.

                        Groups -> (list)
                            The IDs of the security groups for the network in-
                            terface. Applies only if creating a network inter-
                            face when launching an instance.

                            (string)

                        Ipv6AddressCount -> (integer)
                            A  number  of IPv6 addresses to assign to the net-
                            work interface. Amazon EC2 chooses  the  IPv6  ad-
                            dresses  from  the range of the subnet. You cannot
                            specify this option and the option to assign  spe-
                            cific  IPv6 addresses in the same request. You can
                            specify this option if you've specified a  minimum
                            number of instances to launch.

                        Ipv6Addresses -> (list)
                            One  or  more IPv6 addresses to assign to the net-
                            work interface. You cannot specify this option and
                            the option to assign a number of IPv6 addresses in
                            the same request. You cannot specify  this  option
                            if  you've specified a minimum number of instances
                            to launch.

                            (structure)
                               Describes an IPv6 address.

                               Ipv6Address -> (string)
                                   The IPv6 address.

                        NetworkInterfaceId -> (string)
                            The ID of the network interface.

                            If you are creating a Spot Fleet, omit this param-
                            eter  because you cant specify a network interface
                            ID in a launch specification.

                        PrivateIpAddress -> (string)
                            The private IPv4 address of the network interface.
                            Applies  only if creating a network interface when
                            launching an instance. You cannot specify this op-
                            tion if you're launching more than one instance in
                            a RunInstances request.

                        PrivateIpAddresses -> (list)
                            One or more private IPv4 addresses  to  assign  to
                            the  network  interface. Only one private IPv4 ad-
                            dress can be designated  as  primary.  You  cannot
                            specify  this option if you're launching more than
                            one instance in a RunInstances request.

                            (structure)
                               Describes a secondary private IPv4 address  for
                               a network interface.

                               Primary -> (boolean)
                                   Indicates  whether the private IPv4 address
                                   is the primary private IPv4  address.  Only
                                   one  IPv4 address can be designated as pri-
