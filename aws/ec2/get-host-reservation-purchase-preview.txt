NAME
       get-host-reservation-purchase-preview -

DESCRIPTION
       Preview  a reservation purchase with configurations that match those of
       your Dedicated Host. You must have active Dedicated Hosts in  your  ac-
       count before you purchase a reservation.

       This  is  a preview of the  PurchaseHostReservation action and does not
       result in the offering being purchased.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-host-reservation-purchase-preview
          --host-id-set <value>
          --offering-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --host-id-set (list)
          The IDs of the Dedicated Hosts with which the reservation is associ-
          ated.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --offering-id (string)
          The offering ID of the reservation.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
