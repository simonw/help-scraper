CREATE-IMAGE()                                                  CREATE-IMAGE()



NAME
       create-image -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  Amazon  EBS-backed  AMI from an Amazon EBS-backed instance
       that is either running or stopped.

       By default, when Amazon EC2 creates the new AMI,  it  reboots  the  in-
       stance so that it can take snapshots of the attached volumes while data
       is at rest, in order to ensure a consistent  state.  You  can  set  the
       NoReboot  parameter  to true in the API request, or use the --no-reboot
       option in the CLI to prevent Amazon EC2 from shutting down and  reboot-
       ing the instance.

       WARNING:
          If  you  choose to bypass the shutdown and reboot process by setting
          the NoReboot parameter to true in the API request, or by  using  the
          --no-reboot  option  in  the CLI, we can't guarantee the file system
          integrity of the created image.

       If you customized your instance with instance store volumes  or  Amazon
       EBS volumes in addition to the root device volume, the new AMI contains
       block device mapping information for those volumes. When you launch  an
       instance  from  this  new AMI, the instance automatically launches with
       those additional volumes.

       For more information, see Creating Amazon EBS-Backed Linux AMIs in  the
       Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --block-device-mappings (list)
          The  block  device mappings. This parameter cannot be used to modify
          the encryption status of existing volumes or snapshots. To create an
          AMI with encrypted snapshots, use the  CopyImage action.

          (structure)
              Describes  a block device mapping, which defines the EBS volumes
              and instance store volumes to attach to an instance at launch.

              DeviceName -> (string)
                 The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

              VirtualName -> (string)
                 The virtual device name (ephemeral N). Instance store volumes
                 are  numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2 avail-
                 able  instance  store  volumes  can  specify   mappings   for
                 ephemeral0  and ephemeral1 . The number of available instance
                 store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect
                 to the instance, you must mount the volume.

                 NVMe  instance store volumes are automatically enumerated and
                 assigned a device name. Including them in your  block  device
                 mapping has no effect.

                 Constraints:  For  M3  instances,  you  must specify instance
                 store volumes in the block device mapping for  the  instance.
                 When  you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance store
                 volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.

              Ebs -> (structure)
                 Parameters used to automatically set up EBS volumes when  the
                 instance is launched.

                 DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  whether  the EBS volume is deleted on instance
                     termination. For more information, see Preserving  Amazon
                     EBS  volumes  on  instance  termination in the Amazon EC2
                     User Guide .

                 Iops -> (integer)
                     The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3 ,
                     io1 , and io2 volumes, this represents the number of IOPS
                     that are provisioned for the  volume.  For  gp2  volumes,
                     this  represents  the  baseline performance of the volume
                     and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O  credits
                     for bursting.

                     The  following  are  the supported values for each volume
                     type:

                     o gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS

                     o io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                     o io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                     For io1 and io2 volumes, we guarantee  64,000  IOPS  only
                     for  Instances built on the Nitro System . Other instance
                     families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

                     This parameter is required for io1 and io2  volumes.  The
                     default  for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS. This parameter is
                     not supported for gp2 , st1 , sc1 , or standard volumes.

                 SnapshotId -> (string)
                     The ID of the snapshot.

                 VolumeSize -> (integer)
                     The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify  either
                     a  snapshot  ID  or a volume size. If you specify a snap-
                     shot, the default is the snapshot size. You can specify a
                     volume  size that is equal to or larger than the snapshot
                     size.

                     The following are the supported volumes  sizes  for  each
                     volume type:

                     o gp2 and gp3 :1-16,384

                     o io1 and io2 : 4-16,384

                     o st1 and sc1 : 125-16,384

                     o standard : 1-1,024

                 VolumeType -> (string)
                     The  volume  type.  For  more information, see Amazon EBS
                     volume types in the Amazon EC2 User Guide . If the volume
                     type  is  io1 or io2 , you must specify the IOPS that the
                     volume supports.

                 KmsKeyId -> (string)
                     Identifier (key ID, key alias, ID ARN, or alias ARN)  for
                     a  customer managed CMK under which the EBS volume is en-
                     crypted.

                     This parameter is only  supported  on  BlockDeviceMapping
                     objects  called  by RunInstances , RequestSpotFleet , and
                     RequestSpotInstances .

                 Throughput -> (integer)
                     The throughput that the volume supports, in MiB/s.

                     This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes.

                     Valid Range: Minimum value of 125. Maximum value of 1000.

                 OutpostArn -> (string)
                     The ARN of the Outpost on which the snapshot is stored.

                     This parameter is only  supported  on  BlockDeviceMapping
                     objects called by CreateImage .

                 Encrypted -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  whether  the encryption state of an EBS volume
                     is changed while being restored from a backing  snapshot.
                     The  effect  of  setting the encryption state to true de-
                     pends on the volume origin  (new  or  from  a  snapshot),
                     starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryp-
                     tion by default is enabled.  For  more  information,  see
                     Amazon EBS encryption in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

                     In  no  case  can you remove encryption from an encrypted
                     volume.

                     Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances  that
                     support  Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see
                     Supported instance types .

                     This parameter is not returned by  DescribeImageAttribute
                     .

              NoDevice -> (string)
                 To  omit the device from the block device mapping, specify an
                 empty string. When this property is specified, the device  is
                 removed  from  the block device mapping regardless of the as-
                 signed value.

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "DeviceName": "string",
              "VirtualName": "string",
              "Ebs": {
                "DeleteOnTermination": true|false,
                "Iops": integer,
                "SnapshotId": "string",

              "NoDevice": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --description (string)
          A description for the new image.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of the instance.

       --name (string)
          A name for the new image.

          Constraints: 3-128 alphanumeric characters, parentheses (()), square
          brackets ([]), spaces ( ), periods (.),  slashes  (/),  dashes  (-),
          single quotes ('), at-signs (@), or underscores(_)

       --no-reboot | --reboot (boolean)
          By  default, when Amazon EC2 creates the new AMI, it reboots the in-
          stance so that it can take snapshots of the attached  volumes  while
          data  is at rest, in order to ensure a consistent state. You can set
          the NoReboot parameter to true  in  the  API  request,  or  use  the
          --no-reboot  option  in  the CLI to prevent Amazon EC2 from shutting
          down and rebooting the instance.

          WARNING:
              If you choose to bypass the shutdown and reboot process by  set-
              ting  the  NoReboot  parameter to true in the API request, or by
              using the --no-reboot option in the CLI, we can't guarantee  the
              file system integrity of the created image.

          Default: false (follow standard reboot process)

       --tag-specifications (list)
          The  tags to apply to the AMI and snapshots on creation. You can tag
          the AMI, the snapshots, or both.

          o To tag the AMI, the value for ResourceType must be image .

          o To tag the snapshots that are created of the root  volume  and  of
            other  Amazon  EBS  volumes that are attached to the instance, the
            value for ResourceType must be snapshot . The same tag is  applied
            to all of the snapshots that are created.

          If you specify other values for ResourceType , the request fails.

          To  tag an AMI or snapshot after it has been created, see CreateTags
          .

          (structure)
              The tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being  cre-
              ated.

              NOTE:
                 The  Valid  Values  lists  all the resource types that can be
                 tagged. However, the action you're using  might  not  support
                 tagging  all of these resource types. If you try to tag a re-
                 source type that is unsupported for the action you're  using,
                 you'll get an error.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to tag on creation.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags to apply to the resource.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a
                        maximum of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin  with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag values are case-sensitive and accept
                        a maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To create an AMI from an Amazon EBS-backed instance

       The  following  create-image  example creates an AMI from the specified
       instance.

          aws ec2 create-image \
              --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 \
              --name "My server" \
              --description "An AMI for my server"

       Output:

          {
              "ImageId": "ami-0eab20fe36f83e1a8"
          }

       For more information about specifying a block device mapping  for  your
       AMI, see Specifying a block device mapping for an AMI in the Amazon EC2
       User Guide.

       Example 2: To create an AMI from an Amazon EBS-backed instance  without
       reboot

       The following create-image example creates an AMI and sets the --no-re-
       boot parameter, so that the instance is not rebooted before  the  image
       is created.

          aws ec2 create-image \
              --instance-id i-0b09a25c58929de26 \
              --name "My server" \
              --no-reboot

       Output:

          {
              "ImageId": "ami-01d7dcccb80665a0f"
          }
