REQUEST-SPOT-FLEET()                                      REQUEST-SPOT-FLEET()



NAME
       request-spot-fleet -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a Spot Fleet request.

       The  Spot  Fleet  request  specifies  the total target capacity and the
       On-Demand target capacity. Amazon EC2 calculates the difference between
       the  total capacity and On-Demand capacity, and launches the difference
       as Spot capacity.

       You can submit a single request that includes multiple launch  specifi-
       cations that vary by instance type, AMI, Availability Zone, or subnet.

       By default, the Spot Fleet requests Spot Instances in the Spot Instance
       pool where the price per unit is the lowest. Each launch  specification
       can  include  its own instance weighting that reflects the value of the
       instance type to your application workload.

       Alternatively, you can specify that the Spot Fleet distribute the  tar-
       get  capacity  across  the Spot pools included in its launch specifica-
       tions. By ensuring that the Spot Instances in your Spot  Fleet  are  in
       different Spot pools, you can improve the availability of your fleet.

       You  can specify tags for the Spot Fleet request and instances launched
       by the fleet. You cannot tag other resource types in a Spot  Fleet  re-
       quest  because  only the spot-fleet-request and instance resource types
       are supported.

       For more information, see Spot Fleet requests in the  Amazon  EC2  User
       Guide for Linux Instances .

       WARNING:
          We  strongly discourage using the RequestSpotFleet API because it is
          a legacy API with no planned investment. For options for  requesting
          Spot Instances, see Which is the best Spot request method to use? in
          the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances .

SYNOPSIS
            request-spot-fleet
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --spot-fleet-request-config <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --spot-fleet-request-config (structure)
          The configuration for the Spot Fleet request.

          AllocationStrategy -> (string)
              Indicates  how  to  allocate  the  target Spot Instance capacity
              across the Spot Instance pools specified by the Spot  Fleet  re-
              quest.

              If  the allocation strategy is lowestPrice , Spot Fleet launches
              instances from the Spot Instance pools with  the  lowest  price.
              This is the default allocation strategy.

              If  the allocation strategy is diversified , Spot Fleet launches
              instances from all the Spot Instance pools that you specify.

              If the allocation strategy is  capacityOptimized  (recommended),
              Spot  Fleet launches instances from Spot Instance pools with op-
              timal capacity for the number of instances that  are  launching.
              To  give  certain  instance  types  a higher chance of launching
              first, use capacityOptimizedPrioritized .  Set  a  priority  for
              each   instance   type  by  using  the  Priority  parameter  for
              LaunchTemplateOverrides . You can assign the  same  priority  to
              different  LaunchTemplateOverrides  . EC2 implements the priori-
              ties on a best-effort basis, but optimizes for  capacity  first.
              capacityOptimizedPrioritized  is  supported  only  if  your Spot
              Fleet uses a launch template. Note that if  the  OnDemandAlloca-
              tionStrategy  is  set  to prioritized , the same priority is ap-
              plied when fulfilling On-Demand capacity.

          OnDemandAllocationStrategy -> (string)
              The order of the launch template overrides to use in  fulfilling
              On-Demand capacity. If you specify lowestPrice , Spot Fleet uses
              price to determine the order, launching the lowest price  first.
              If  you  specify prioritized , Spot Fleet uses the priority that
              you assign to each Spot Fleet launch template override,  launch-
              ing  the  highest priority first. If you do not specify a value,
              Spot Fleet defaults to lowestPrice .

          SpotMaintenanceStrategies -> (structure)
              The strategies for managing your Spot Instances that are  at  an
              elevated risk of being interrupted.

              CapacityRebalance -> (structure)
                 The Spot Instance replacement strategy to use when Amazon EC2
                 emits a signal that your Spot Instance is at an elevated risk
                 of  being interrupted. For more information, see Capacity re-
                 balancing in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances .

                 ReplacementStrategy -> (string)
                     The replacement  strategy  to  use.  Only  available  for
                     fleets of type maintain .
                        launch  -  Spot  Fleet launches a new replacement Spot
                        Instance when a rebalance notification is emitted  for
                        an  existing  Spot  Instance  in the fleet. Spot Fleet
                        does not terminate the instances that receive a rebal-
                        ance  notification.  You  can  terminate  the  old in-
                        stances, or  you  can  leave  them  running.  You  are
                        charged for all instances while they are running.

                        launch-before-terminate  -  Spot  Fleet launches a new
                        replacement Spot Instance when a  rebalance  notifica-
                        tion  is  emitted for an existing Spot Instance in the
                        fleet, and then, after a delay that  you  specify  (in
                        TerminationDelay  ), terminates the instances that re-
                        ceived a rebalance notification.

                 TerminationDelay -> (integer)
                     The amount of time (in seconds) that Amazon EC2 waits be-
                     fore  terminating the old Spot Instance after launching a
                     new replacement Spot Instance.

                     Required when ReplacementStrategy is  set  to  launch-be-
                     fore-terminate .

                     Not valid when ReplacementStrategy is set to launch .

                     Valid values: Minimum value of 120 seconds. Maximum value
                     of 7200 seconds.

          ClientToken -> (string)
              A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide  to  ensure
              the  idempotency of your listings. This helps to avoid duplicate
              listings. For more information, see Ensuring Idempotency .

          ExcessCapacityTerminationPolicy -> (string)
              Indicates whether running Spot Instances should be terminated if
              you decrease the target capacity of the Spot Fleet request below
              the current size of the Spot Fleet.

          FulfilledCapacity -> (double)
              The number of units fulfilled by this request  compared  to  the
              set target capacity. You cannot set this value.

          OnDemandFulfilledCapacity -> (double)
              The number of On-Demand units fulfilled by this request compared
              to the set target On-Demand capacity.

          IamFleetRole -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access Manage-
              ment (IAM) role that grants the Spot Fleet the permission to re-
              quest, launch, terminate, and tag instances on your behalf.  For
              more information, see Spot Fleet prerequisites in the Amazon EC2
              User Guide for Linux Instances . Spot Fleet can  terminate  Spot
              Instances  on your behalf when you cancel its Spot Fleet request
              using CancelSpotFleetRequests or when the Spot Fleet request ex-
              pires, if you set TerminateInstancesWithExpiration .

          LaunchSpecifications -> (list)
              The  launch  specifications  for  the Spot Fleet request. If you
              specify LaunchSpecifications , you can't specify LaunchTemplate-
              Configs . If you include On-Demand capacity in your request, you
              must use LaunchTemplateConfigs .

              (structure)
                 Describes the launch specification for one or more  Spot  In-
                 stances.  If you include On-Demand capacity in your fleet re-
                 quest or want to specify an EFA network device, you can't use
                 SpotFleetLaunchSpecification      ;      you     must     use
                 LaunchTemplateConfig .

                 SecurityGroups -> (list)
                     One or more security groups. When requesting instances in
                     a  VPC,  you must specify the IDs of the security groups.
                     When requesting instances in EC2-Classic, you can specify
                     the names or the IDs of the security groups.

                     (structure)
                        Describes a security group.

                        GroupName -> (string)
                            The name of the security group.

                        GroupId -> (string)
                            The ID of the security group.

                 AddressingType -> (string)
                     Deprecated.

                 BlockDeviceMappings -> (list)
                     One or more block devices that are mapped to the Spot In-
                     stances. You can't specify both a snapshot ID and an  en-
                     cryption value. This is because only blank volumes can be
                     encrypted on creation. If a snapshot is the basis  for  a
                     volume, it is not blank and its encryption status is used
                     for the volume encryption status.

                     (structure)
                        Describes a block device mapping,  which  defines  the
                        EBS volumes and instance store volumes to attach to an
                        instance at launch.

                        DeviceName -> (string)
                            The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

                        VirtualName -> (string)
                            The virtual device name  (ephemeral  N).  Instance
                            store volumes are numbered starting from 0. An in-
                            stance type with 2 available instance  store  vol-
                            umes  can  specify  mappings  for  ephemeral0  and
                            ephemeral1 .  The  number  of  available  instance
                            store  volumes depends on the instance type. After
                            you connect to the instance, you  must  mount  the
                            volume.

                            NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enu-
                            merated and assigned a device name. Including them
                            in your block device mapping has no effect.

                            Constraints:  For  M3  instances, you must specify
                            instance store volumes in the block device mapping
                            for  the instance. When you launch an M3 instance,
                            we ignore any instance store volumes specified  in
                            the block device mapping for the AMI.

                        Ebs -> (structure)
                            Parameters  used  to automatically set up EBS vol-
                            umes when the instance is launched.

                            DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                               Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted  on
                               instance termination. For more information, see
                               Preserving Amazon EBS volumes on instance  ter-
                               mination in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

                            Iops -> (integer)
                               The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS).
                               For gp3 , io1 , and io2  volumes,  this  repre-
                               sents  the  number of IOPS that are provisioned
                               for the volume. For gp2  volumes,  this  repre-
                               sents  the  baseline  performance of the volume
                               and the rate at which  the  volume  accumulates
                               I/O credits for bursting.

                               The following are the supported values for each
                               volume type:

                               o gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS

                               o io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                               o io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                               For io1 and io2 volumes,  we  guarantee  64,000
                               IOPS only for Instances built on the Nitro Sys-
                               tem . Other instance families guarantee perfor-
                               mance up to 32,000 IOPS.

                               This parameter is required for io1 and io2 vol-
                               umes. The default  for  gp3  volumes  is  3,000
                               IOPS. This parameter is not supported for gp2 ,
                               st1 , sc1 , or standard volumes.

                            SnapshotId -> (string)
                               The ID of the snapshot.

                            VolumeSize -> (integer)
                               The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must spec-
                               ify  either  a snapshot ID or a volume size. If
                               you specify a  snapshot,  the  default  is  the
                               snapshot  size.  You  can specify a volume size
                               that is equal to or larger  than  the  snapshot
                               size.

                               The  following  are the supported volumes sizes
                               for each volume type:

                               o gp2 and gp3 :1-16,384

                               o io1 and io2 : 4-16,384

                               o st1 and sc1 : 125-16,384

                               o standard : 1-1,024

                            VolumeType -> (string)
                               The volume  type.  For  more  information,  see
                               Amazon  EBS volume types in the Amazon EC2 User
                               Guide . If the volume type is io1 or io2 ,  you
                               must specify the IOPS that the volume supports.

                            KmsKeyId -> (string)
                               Identifier (key ID, key alias, ID ARN, or alias
                               ARN) for a customer managed CMK under which the
                               EBS volume is encrypted.

                               This  parameter  is  only supported on BlockDe-
                               viceMapping objects called  by  RunInstances  ,
                               RequestSpotFleet , and RequestSpotInstances .

                            Throughput -> (integer)
                               The  throughput  that  the  volume supports, in
                               MiB/s.

                               This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes.

                               Valid Range:  Minimum  value  of  125.  Maximum
                               value of 1000.

                            OutpostArn -> (string)
                               The ARN of the Outpost on which the snapshot is
                               stored.

                               This parameter is only  supported  on  BlockDe-
                               viceMapping objects called by CreateImage .

                            Encrypted -> (boolean)
                               Indicates  whether  the  encryption state of an

                        NoDevice -> (string)
                            To omit the device from the block device  mapping,
                            specify  an  empty  string.  When this property is
                            specified, the device is removed  from  the  block
                            device mapping regardless of the assigned value.

                 EbsOptimized -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  whether  the  instances  are optimized for EBS
                     I/O. This optimization provides dedicated  throughput  to
                     Amazon  EBS  and an optimized configuration stack to pro-
                     vide optimal EBS I/O performance. This optimization isn't
                     available  with  all  instance  types.  Additional  usage
                     charges apply when using an EBS Optimized instance.

                     One  or more network interfaces. If you specify a network
                     interface, you must specify subnet IDs and security group
                     IDs using the network interface.

                     NOTE:
                        SpotFleetLaunchSpecification  currently  does not sup-
                        port Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA). To specify an  EFA,
                        you must use LaunchTemplateConfig .

                     (structure)
                        Describes a network interface.

                        AssociatePublicIpAddress -> (boolean)

                            face for eth0, and can only be assigned to  a  new
                            network interface, not an existing one. You cannot
                            specify more than one network interface in the re-
                            quest. If launching into a default subnet, the de-
                            fault value is true .

                        DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)

                            work  interface.  Amazon  EC2 chooses the IPv6 ad-
                            dresses from the range of the subnet.  You  cannot
                            specify  this option and the option to assign spe-
                            cific IPv6 addresses in the same request. You  can
                            specify  this option if you've specified a minimum
                            number of instances to launch.

                        Ipv6Addresses -> (list)
                            One or more IPv6 addresses to assign to  the  net-

                            launching an instance. You cannot specify this op-
                            tion if you're launching more than one instance in
                            a RunInstances request.

                        PrivateIpAddresses -> (list)
                            One  or  more  private IPv4 addresses to assign to
                            the network interface. Only one private  IPv4  ad-
                            dress  can  be  designated  as primary. You cannot
                            specify this option if you're launching more  than
                            one instance in a RunInstances request.

                            (structure)

                            index 0. The default is network card index 0.

                            If you are using  RequestSpotInstances  to  create
                            Spot  Instances,  omit  this parameter because you
                            cant specify the network  card  index  when  using
                            this  API.  To specify the network card index, use

                     The number of units provided by  the  specified  instance
                     type.  These are the same units that you chose to set the
                     target capacity in terms of instances, or  a  performance
                     characteristic such as vCPUs, memory, or I/O.

                     If  the  target  capacity  divided by this value is not a
                     whole number, Amazon EC2 rounds the number  of  instances
                     to the next whole number. If this value is not specified,

                        , m5a.* , r* , *3* .

                        For  example,  if you specify c5* ,Amazon EC2 will ex-
                        clude the entire C5 instance  family,  which  includes
                        all C5a and C5n instance types. If you specify m5a.* ,
                        Amazon EC2 will exclude all the  M5a  instance  types,

                        The price protection  threshold  for  Spot  Instances.
                        This is the maximum youll pay for a Spot Instance, ex-
                        pressed as a percentage above the cheapest M, C, or  R
                        instance  type  with  your  specified attributes. When
                        Amazon  EC2  selects  instance  types  with  your  at-
                        tributes, it excludes instance types priced above your
                        threshold.

                        The parameter accepts an integer, which Amazon EC2 in-
                        terprets as a percentage.

                        To  turn  off  price protection, specify a high value,
                        such as 999999 .

                        This    parameter     is     not     supported     for
                        GetSpotPlacementScores                             and

                        NOTE:
                            If you set TargetCapacityUnitType to vcpu or  mem-
                            ory-mib  ,  the  price protection threshold is ap-
                            plied based on the per-vCPU  or  per-memory  price
                            instead of the per-instance price.

                        mand  Instance,  expressed  as  a percentage above the
                        cheapest M, C, or R instance type with your  specified
                        attributes.  When  Amazon  EC2  selects instance types
                        with  your  attributes,  it  excludes  instance  types
                        priced above your threshold.

                        The parameter accepts an integer, which Amazon EC2 in-
                        terprets as a percentage.

                        To turn off price protection, specify  a  high  value,
                        such as 999999 .

                        If  the  value is $Latest , Amazon EC2 uses the latest
                        version of the launch template.

                        If the value is $Default , Amazon EC2 uses the default
                        version of the launch template.

                 Overrides -> (list)
                     Any parameters that you specify override the same parame-
                     ters in the launch template.

                     (structure)
                        Describes overrides for a launch template.

                            stance type.

                        Priority -> (double)
                            The priority for the launch template override. The
                            highest priority is launched first.

                            If  OnDemandAllocationStrategy  is  set to priori-
                            tized , Spot  Fleet  uses  priority  to  determine
                            which  launch  template  override  to use first in
                            fulfilling On-Demand capacity.

                            If the Spot AllocationStrategy is set to capacity-
                            OptimizedPrioritized , Spot Fleet uses priority on
                            a best-effort basis to determine which launch tem-
                            plate override to use in fulfilling Spot capacity,
                            but optimizes for capacity first.

                            Valid values are whole numbers starting at 0 . The
                            lower  the  number, the higher the priority. If no
                            number is set, the launch  template  override  has
                            the lowest priority. You can set the same priority
                            for different launch template overrides.

                        InstanceRequirements -> (structure)
                            The instance requirements. When  you  specify  in-
                            stance  requirements, Amazon EC2 will identify in-
                            stance types with the provided  requirements,  and
                            then   use  your  On-Demand  and  Spot  allocation
                            strategies to launch instances from these instance
                            types,  in the same way as when you specify a list
                            of instance types.

                            NOTE:
                               If you specify InstanceRequirements , you can't
                               specify InstanceTypes .

                               The  instance  types  to  exclude.  You can use
                               strings with one or  more  wild  cards,  repre-
                               sented  by  an asterisk (* ), to exclude an in-
                               stance type, size, or generation. The following

                               If  you specify m5a.* , Amazon EC2 will exclude
                               all the M5a instance types, but not the M5n in-
                               stance types.

                               Default: No excluded instance types

                               Default: Any accelerator

                               (string)

                            AcceleratorTotalMemoryMiB -> (structure)
                               The minimum and maximum amount of total  accel-
                               erator memory, in MiB.

                               Default: No minimum or maximum limits

                               Min -> (integer)
                                   The  minimum  amount of accelerator memory,
                                   in MiB. If this parameter is not specified,
                                   there is no minimum limit.

                               Max -> (integer)
                                   The  maximum  amount of accelerator memory,
                                   in MiB. If this parameter is not specified,
                                   there is no maximum limit.

          SpotPrice -> (string)
              The  maximum price per unit hour that you are willing to pay for
              a Spot Instance. The default is the On-Demand price.

          TargetCapacity -> (integer)
              The number of units to request  for  the  Spot  Fleet.  You  can
              choose  to  set  the  target capacity in terms of instances or a
              performance characteristic that is important to your application
              workload,  such as vCPUs, memory, or I/O. If the request type is
              maintain , you can specify a target capacity of 0 and add capac-
              ity later.

          OnDemandTargetCapacity -> (integer)
              The  number of On-Demand units to request. You can choose to set
              the target capacity in terms of instances or a performance char-
              acteristic  that is important to your application workload, such
              as vCPUs, memory, or I/O. If the request type is maintain ,  you
              can specify a target capacity of 0 and add capacity later.

          OnDemandMaxTotalPrice -> (string)
              The  maximum amount per hour for On-Demand Instances that you're
              willing to pay. You can use the onDemandMaxTotalPrice parameter,
              the  spotMaxTotalPrice  parameter,  or both parameters to ensure
              that your fleet cost does not exceed your budget. If you  set  a
              maximum  price per hour for the On-Demand Instances and Spot In-
              stances in your request, Spot Fleet will launch instances  until
              it  reaches  the  maximum amount you're willing to pay. When the
              maximum amount you're willing to pay is reached, the fleet stops
              launching instances even if it hasnt met the target capacity.

          SpotMaxTotalPrice -> (string)
              The maximum amount per hour for Spot Instances that you're will-
              ing to pay. You can use the  spotdMaxTotalPrice  parameter,  the
              onDemandMaxTotalPrice  parameter,  or  both parameters to ensure
              that your fleet cost does not exceed your budget. If you  set  a
              maximum  price per hour for the On-Demand Instances and Spot In-
              stances in your request, Spot Fleet will launch instances  until
              it  reaches  the  maximum amount you're willing to pay. When the
              maximum amount you're willing to pay is reached, the fleet stops
              launching instances even if it hasnt met the target capacity.

          TerminateInstancesWithExpiration -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether running Spot Instances are terminated when the
              Spot Fleet request expires.

          Type -> (string)
              The type of request. Indicates whether the Spot Fleet  only  re-
              quests the target capacity or also attempts to maintain it. When
              this value is request , the Spot Fleet only places the  required
              requests. It does not attempt to replenish Spot Instances if ca-
              pacity is diminished, nor does it submit requests in alternative
              Spot  pools  if  capacity  is  not available. When this value is
              maintain , the Spot Fleet maintains  the  target  capacity.  The
              Spot Fleet places the required requests to meet capacity and au-
              tomatically  replenishes  any  interrupted  instances.  Default:
              maintain . instant is listed but is not used by Spot Fleet.

          ValidFrom -> (timestamp)
              The  start date and time of the request, in UTC format (YYYY -MM
              -DD T*HH* :MM :SS Z). By default, Amazon EC2  starts  fulfilling
              the request immediately.

          ValidUntil -> (timestamp)
              The  end  date  and time of the request, in UTC format (YYYY -MM
              -DD T*HH* :MM :SS Z). After the end date and time, no  new  Spot
              Instance  requests are placed or able to fulfill the request. If
              no value is specified, the Spot Fleet request remains until  you
              cancel it.

          ReplaceUnhealthyInstances -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether Spot Fleet should replace unhealthy instances.

          InstanceInterruptionBehavior -> (string)
              The behavior when a Spot Instance is interrupted. The default is
              terminate .

          LoadBalancersConfig -> (structure)
              One or more Classic Load Balancers and target groups  to  attach
              to the Spot Fleet request. Spot Fleet registers the running Spot
              Instances with the specified Classic Load Balancers  and  target
              groups.

              With  Network  Load  Balancers,  Spot  Fleet cannot register in-
              stances that have the following instance types:  C1,  CC1,  CC2,
              CG1, CG2, CR1, CS1, G1, G2, HI1, HS1, M1, M2, M3, and T1.

              ClassicLoadBalancersConfig -> (structure)
                 The Classic Load Balancers.

                 ClassicLoadBalancers -> (list)
                     One or more Classic Load Balancers.

                     (structure)
                        Describes a Classic Load Balancer.

                        Name -> (string)
                            The name of the load balancer.

              TargetGroupsConfig -> (structure)
                 The target groups.

                 TargetGroups -> (list)
                     One or more target groups.

                     (structure)
                        Describes a load balancer target group.

                        Arn -> (string)
                            The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the target
                            group.

          InstancePoolsToUseCount -> (integer)
              The number of Spot pools across which to  allocate  your  target
              Spot capacity. Valid only when Spot AllocationStrategy is set to
              lowest-price . Spot Fleet selects the cheapest  Spot  pools  and
              evenly  allocates your target Spot capacity across the number of
              Spot pools that you specify.

              Note that Spot Fleet attempts to draw Spot  Instances  from  the
              number  of  pools  that you specify on a best effort basis. If a
              pool runs out of Spot capacity before fulfilling your target ca-
              pacity,  Spot  Fleet  will  continue  to fulfill your request by
              drawing from the next cheapest pool. To ensure that your  target
              capacity is met, you might receive Spot Instances from more than
              the number of pools that you specified. Similarly,  if  most  of
              the  pools  have  no  Spot capacity, you might receive your full
              target capacity from fewer than the number  of  pools  that  you
              specified.

          Context -> (string)
              Reserved.

          TargetCapacityUnitType -> (string)
              The unit for the target capacity.

              Default: units (translates to number of instances)

          TagSpecifications -> (list)
              The  key-value  pair  for tagging the Spot Fleet request on cre-
              ation. The value for ResourceType must be  spot-fleet-request  ,
              otherwise  the  Spot  Fleet  request  fails. To tag instances at
              launch, specify the tags in the launch template (valid  only  if
              you use LaunchTemplateConfigs ) or in the ` SpotFleetTagSpecifi-
              cation
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_SpotFleetTagSpecification.html`__
              (valid only if you use LaunchSpecifications ).  For  information
              about tagging after launch, see Tagging Your Resources .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To request a Spot fleet in the subnet with the lowest price

       This example command creates a Spot fleet request with two launch spec-
       ifications that differ only by subnet.  The Spot fleet launches the in-
       stances in the specified subnet with the  lowest  price.   If  the  in-
       stances are launched in a default VPC, they receive a public IP address
       by default.  If the instances are launched in a nondefault VPC, they do
       not receive a public IP address by default.

       Note  that you can't specify different subnets from the same Availabil-
       ity Zone in a Spot fleet request.

       Command:

          aws ec2 request-spot-fleet --spot-fleet-request-config file://config.json

       To request a Spot fleet in the Availability Zone with the lowest price

       This example command creates a Spot fleet request with two launch spec-
       ifications  that  differ  only  by  Availability  Zone.  The Spot fleet
       launches the instances in the specified Availability Zone with the low-
       est  price.  If your account supports EC2-VPC only, Amazon EC2 launches
       the Spot instances in the default subnet of the Availability Zone.   If
       your account supports EC2-Classic, Amazon EC2 launches the instances in
       EC2-Classic in the Availability Zone.

       Command:

          aws ec2 request-spot-fleet --spot-fleet-request-config file://config.json

       Config.json:

          {
            "SpotPrice": "0.04",
            "TargetCapacity": 2,

                        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:instance-profile/my-iam-role"
                    }
                }
            ]
          }

       To launch Spot instances in a subnet and  assign  them  public  IP  ad-
       dresses

       This  example command assigns public addresses to instances launched in
       a nondefault VPC.  Note that when you specify a network interface,  you
       must  include the subnet ID and security group ID using the network in-
       terface.

       Command:

          aws ec2 request-spot-fleet --spot-fleet-request-config file://config.json

       Config.json:

          {
            "SpotPrice": "0.04",
            "TargetCapacity": 2,

       To request a Spot fleet using the diversified allocation strategy

       This example command creates a Spot fleet request that launches 30  in-
       stances using the diversified allocation strategy.  The launch specifi-
       cations differ by instance type. The Spot  fleet  distributes  the  in-
       stances  across  the  launch  specifications such that there are 10 in-
       stances of each type.

       Command:

          aws ec2 request-spot-fleet --spot-fleet-request-config file://config.json

       Config.json:

          {
            "SpotPrice": "0.70",
            "TargetCapacity": 30,
            "AllocationStrategy": "diversified",
            "IamFleetRole": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-spot-fleet-role",
