          --availability-zone <value>
          [--client-token <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --auto-placement (string)
          Indicates  whether the host accepts any untargeted instance launches
          that match its instance type configuration, or if  it  only  accepts
          Host  tenancy instance launches that specify its unique host ID. For
          more information, see Understanding auto-placement and  affinity  in
          the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

          Default: on

          Possible values:

          o on

          o off

       --availability-zone (string)
          The Availability Zone in which to allocate the Dedicated Host.

       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. For more information, see Ensuring Idem-
          potency .

       --instance-type (string)
          Specifies  the instance type to be supported by the Dedicated Hosts.
          If you specify an instance type, the  Dedicated  Hosts  support  in-
          stances of the specified instance type only.

          If  you  want the Dedicated Hosts to support multiple instance types
          in a specific instance family, omit this parameter and  specify  In-
          stanceFamily  instead. You cannot specify InstanceType and Instance-
          Family in the same request.

       --instance-family (string)
          Specifies the instance family  to  be  supported  by  the  Dedicated
          Hosts.  If  you specify an instance family, the Dedicated Hosts sup-
          port multiple instance types within that instance family.

          If you want the Dedicated Hosts to support a specific instance  type
          only, omit this parameter and specify InstanceType instead. You can-
          not specify InstanceFamily and InstanceType in the same request.

       --quantity (integer)
          The number of Dedicated Hosts to allocate to your account with these
          parameters.

       --tag-specifications (list)
          The tags to apply to the Dedicated Host during creation.

          (structure)
              The  tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being cre-
              ated.

              NOTE:
                 The Valid Values lists all the resource  types  that  can  be
                 tagged.  However,  the  action you're using might not support
                 tagging all of these resource types. If you try to tag a  re-
                 source  type that is unsupported for the action you're using,
                 you'll get an error.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to tag on creation.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags to apply to the resource.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept  a
                        maximum  of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and  accept
                        a maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

          ResourceType=string,Tags=[{Key=string,Value=string},{Key=string,Value=string}] ...

       --host-recovery (string)
          Indicates  whether  to enable or disable host recovery for the Dedi-
          cated Host. Host recovery is disabled by default. For more  informa-
          tion, see Host recovery in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

          Default: off

          Possible values:

          o on

          o off

       --outpost-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web Services Outpost on
          which to allocate the Dedicated Host.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To allocate a Dedicated Host

       The following allocate-hosts example allocates a single Dedicated  Host
       in the eu-west-1a Availability Zone, onto which you can launch m5.large
       instances. By default, the Dedicated Host accepts only target  instance
       launches, and does not support host recovery.

          aws ec2 allocate-hosts \
              --instance-type m5.large \
              --availability-zone eu-west-1a \
              --quantity 1

       Output:

          {
              "HostIds": [
                  "h-07879acf49EXAMPLE"
              ]
          }

       Example  2:  To  allocate a Dedicated Host with auto-placement and host
       recovery enabled

       The following allocate-hosts example allocates a single Dedicated  Host
       in the eu-west-1a Availability Zone with auto-placement and host recov-
       ery enabled.

          aws ec2 allocate-hosts \
              --instance-type m5.large \
              --availability-zone eu-west-1a \
              --auto-placement on \
              --host-recovery on \
              --quantity 1

       Output:

          {
               "HostIds": [
                   "h-07879acf49EXAMPLE"
               ]
          }

       Example 3: To allocate a Dedicated Host with tags

       The following allocate-hosts example allocates a single Dedicated  Host
       and applies a tag with a key named purpose and a value of production.

          aws ec2 allocate-hosts \
              --instance-type m5.large \
              --availability-zone eu-west-1a \
              --quantity 1 \
              --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=dedicated-host,Tags={Key=purpose,Value=production}'

       Output:

          {
              "HostIds": [
                  "h-07879acf49EXAMPLE"
              ]
          }

       Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide for Linux Instances.

OUTPUT
       HostIds -> (list)
          The ID of the allocated Dedicated Host. This is used  to  launch  an
          instance onto a specific host.

          (string)
