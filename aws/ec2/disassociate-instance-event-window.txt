SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-instance-event-window
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --instance-event-window-id <value>
          --association-target <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --instance-event-window-id (string)
          The ID of the event window.

       --association-target (structure)
          One or more targets to disassociate from the specified event window.

          InstanceIds -> (list)
              The IDs of the instances to disassociate from the event window.

              (string)

          InstanceTags -> (list)
              The instance tags to disassociate from the event window. Any in-
              stances associated with the tags will be disassociated from  the
              event window.

              (structure)
                 Describes a tag.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the tag.

                     Constraints:  Tag  keys  are  case-sensitive and accept a
                     maximum of 127 Unicode characters.  May  not  begin  with
                     aws: .

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of the tag.

                     Constraints:  Tag  values are case-sensitive and accept a
                     maximum of 255 Unicode characters.

          DedicatedHostIds -> (list)
              The IDs of the Dedicated Hosts to disassociate  from  the  event
              window.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          InstanceIds=string,string,InstanceTags=[{Key=string,Value=string},{Key=string,Value=string}],DedicatedHostIds=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "InstanceIds": ["string", ...],
            "InstanceTags": [
              {
                "Key": "string",
                "Value": "string"
              }
              ...
            ],
            "DedicatedHostIds": ["string", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To disassociate one or more instances from an event window

       The following disassociate-instance-event-window example  disassociates
       one   or   more  instances  from  an  event  window.  Specify  the  in-
       stance-event-window-id parameter to specify the event window. To disas-
       sociate  instances,  specify  the association-target parameter, and for
       the parameter values, specify one or more instance IDs.

          aws ec2 disassociate-instance-event-window \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --instance-event-window-id iew-0abcdef1234567890 \
              --association-target "InstanceIds=i-1234567890abcdef0,i-0598c7d356eba48d7"

       Output:

          {
              "InstanceEventWindow": {
                  "InstanceEventWindowId": "iew-0abcdef1234567890",
                  "Name": "myEventWindowName",
                  "CronExpression": "* 21-23 * * 2,3",
                  "AssociationTarget": {
                      "InstanceIds": [],
                      "Tags": [],
                      "DedicatedHostIds": []
                  },
                  "State": "creating"
              }
          }

       Events section of the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

       Example 2: To disassociate instance tags from an event window

       The  following disassociate-instance-event-window example disassociates
       instance tags from an event  window.  Specify  the  instance-event-win-
       dow-id  parameter to specify the event window. To disassociate instance
       tags, specify the association-target parameter, and for  the  parameter
       values, specify one or more tags.

          aws ec2 disassociate-instance-event-window \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --instance-event-window-id iew-0abcdef1234567890 \
              --association-target "InstanceTags=[{Key=k2,Value=v2},{Key=k1,Value=v1}]"

       Output:

          {
              "InstanceEventWindow": {
                  "InstanceEventWindowId": "iew-0abcdef1234567890",
                  "Name": "myEventWindowName",
                  "CronExpression": "* 21-23 * * 2,3",
                  "AssociationTarget": {
                      "InstanceIds": [],
                      "Tags": [],
                      "DedicatedHostIds": []
                  },

       Events section of the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

       Example 3: To disassociate a Dedicated Host from an event window

       The following disassociate-instance-event-window example  disassociates
       a  Dedicated Host from an event window. Specify the instance-event-win-
       dow-id parameter to specify the event window. To disassociate  a  Dedi-
       cated  Host,  specify the association-target parameter, and for the pa-
       rameter values, specify one or more Dedicated Host IDs.

          aws ec2 disassociate-instance-event-window \
              --region us-east-1 \
