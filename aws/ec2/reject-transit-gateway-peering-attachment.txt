NAME
       reject-transit-gateway-peering-attachment -

DESCRIPTION
       Rejects a transit gateway peering attachment request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            reject-transit-gateway-peering-attachment
          --transit-gateway-attachment-id <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --transit-gateway-attachment-id (string)
          The ID of the transit gateway peering attachment.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To reject a transit gateway peering attachment

       The following reject-transit-gateway-peering-attachment example rejects
       the specified transit gateway peering attachment request. The  --region
       parameter specifies the Region that the accepter transit gateway is lo-
       cated in.

          aws ec2 reject-transit-gateway-peering-attachment \
              --transit-gateway-attachment-id tgw-attach-4455667788aabbccd \
              --region us-east-2

       Output:

          {
              "TransitGatewayPeeringAttachment": {
                  "TransitGatewayAttachmentId": "tgw-attach-4455667788aabbccd",

                      "Region": "us-west-2"
                  },
                  "AccepterTgwInfo": {
                      "TransitGatewayId": "tgw-11223344aabbcc112",

          }
