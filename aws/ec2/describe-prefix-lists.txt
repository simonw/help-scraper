DESCRIBE-PREFIX-LISTS()                                DESCRIBE-PREFIX-LISTS()



NAME
       describe-prefix-lists -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  available Amazon Web Services services in a prefix list for-
       mat, which includes the prefix list name and prefix list ID of the ser-
       vice and the IP address range for the service.

       We recommend that you use  DescribeManagedPrefixLists instead.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-prefix-lists  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: PrefixLists

SYNOPSIS
            describe-prefix-lists
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--prefix-list-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters.

          o prefix-list-id : The ID of a prefix list.

          o prefix-list-name : The name of a prefix list.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --prefix-list-ids (list)
          One or more prefix list IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe prefix lists

       This example lists all available prefix lists for the region.

       Command:

          aws ec2 describe-prefix-lists

       Output:

          {
            "PrefixLists": [
              {
                "PrefixListName": "com.amazonaws.us-east-1.s3",
                "Cidrs": [
                  "54.231.0.0/17"
                ],
                "PrefixListId": "pl-63a5400a"
              }
            ]
          }

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)

          null when there are no more results to return.

       PrefixLists -> (list)
          All available prefix lists.

          (structure)

              Cidrs -> (list)
                 The IP address range of the Amazon Web Service.

                 (string)

              PrefixListId -> (string)
                 The ID of the prefix.

              PrefixListName -> (string)
