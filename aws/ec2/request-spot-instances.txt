NAME
       request-spot-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a Spot Instance request.

       For more information, see Spot Instance requests in the Amazon EC2 User
       Guide for Linux Instances .

       WARNING:
          We strongly discourage using the RequestSpotInstances API because it
          is a legacy API with no planned investment. For options for request-
          ing Spot Instances, see Which is the best  Spot  request  method  to
          use? in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances .

OPTIONS
       --availability-zone-group (string)
          The user-specified name for a logical grouping of requests.

          When  you  specify an Availability Zone group in a Spot Instance re-
          quest, all Spot Instances in the request are launched  in  the  same
          Availability Zone. Instance proximity is maintained with this param-
          eter, but the choice of Availability Zone is not. The group  applies
          only  to  requests for Spot Instances of the same instance type. Any
          additional Spot Instance requests that are specified with  the  same
          Availability  Zone group name are launched in that same Availability
          Zone, as long as at least one instance from the group is  still  ac-
          tive.

          If  there  is  no  active  instance running in the Availability Zone
          group that you specify for a new  Spot  Instance  request  (all  in-
          stances are terminated, the request is expired, or the maximum price
          you specified falls below  current  Spot  price),  then  Amazon  EC2
          launches  the instance in any Availability Zone where the constraint
          can be met. Consequently, the subsequent set of Spot Instances could
          be placed in a different zone from the original request, even if you
          specified the same Availability Zone group.

          Default: Instances are launched in any available Availability Zone.

       --block-duration-minutes (integer)
          Deprecated.

       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency  of the request. For more information, see How to Ensure
          Idempotency in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances .

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --instance-count (integer)
          The maximum number of Spot Instances to launch.

          Default: 1

       --launch-group (string)
          The  instance  launch  group.  Launch groups are Spot Instances that
          launch together and terminate together.

          Default: Instances are launched and terminated individually

       --launch-specification (structure)
          The launch specification.

          SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              The IDs of the security groups.

              (string)

          SecurityGroups -> (list)
              Not supported.

              (string)

          AddressingType -> (string)
              Deprecated.

          BlockDeviceMappings -> (list)
              The block device mapping entries. You can't specify both a snap-
              shot ID and an encryption value. This is because only blank vol-
              umes can be encrypted on creation. If a snapshot  is  the  basis
              for  a volume, it is not blank and its encryption status is used
              for the volume encryption status.

              (structure)
                 Describes a block device mapping, which defines the EBS  vol-
                 umes  and  instance store volumes to attach to an instance at
                 launch.

                 DeviceName -> (string)
                     The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

                 VirtualName -> (string)
                     The virtual device name  (ephemeral  N).  Instance  store
                     volumes  are  numbered  starting from 0. An instance type
                     with 2 available instance store volumes can specify  map-
                     pings  for  ephemeral0  and  ephemeral1  .  The number of
                     available instance store volumes depends on the  instance
                     type.  After  you connect to the instance, you must mount
                     the volume.

                     NVMe instance store volumes are automatically  enumerated
                     and  assigned a device name. Including them in your block
                     device mapping has no effect.

                     Constraints: For M3 instances, you must specify  instance
                     store  volumes  in  the  block device mapping for the in-
                     stance. When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any in-
                     stance  store  volumes specified in the block device map-
                     ping for the AMI.

                 Ebs -> (structure)
                     Parameters used to automatically set up EBS volumes  when
                     the instance is launched.

                     DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                        Indicates  whether  the  EBS  volume is deleted on in-
                        stance  termination.   For   more   information,   see
                        Preserving  Amazon EBS volumes on instance termination
                        in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

                     Iops -> (integer)
                        The number of I/O operations per  second  (IOPS).  For
                        gp3  , io1 , and io2 volumes, this represents the num-
                        ber of IOPS that are provisioned for the  volume.  For
                        gp2  volumes, this represents the baseline performance
                        of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumu-
                        lates I/O credits for bursting.

                        The following are the supported values for each volume
                        type:

                        o gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS

                        o io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                        o io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                        For io1 and io2 volumes, we guarantee 64,000 IOPS only
                        for  Instances  built  on the Nitro System . Other in-
                        stance families guarantee  performance  up  to  32,000
                        IOPS.

                        This  parameter  is  required for io1 and io2 volumes.
                        The default for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS. This param-
                        eter  is  not supported for gp2 , st1 , sc1 , or stan-
                        dard volumes.

                     SnapshotId -> (string)
                        The ID of the snapshot.

                     VolumeSize -> (integer)
                        The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify  ei-
                        ther  a snapshot ID or a volume size. If you specify a
                        snapshot, the default is the snapshot  size.  You  can
                        specify  a volume size that is equal to or larger than
                        the snapshot size.

                        The following are the supported volumes sizes for each
                        volume type:

                        o gp2 and gp3 :1-16,384

                        o io1 and io2 : 4-16,384

                        o st1 and sc1 : 125-16,384

                        o standard : 1-1,024

                     VolumeType -> (string)
                        The  volume type. For more information, see Amazon EBS
                        volume types in the Amazon EC2 User  Guide  .  If  the
                        volume  type is io1 or io2 , you must specify the IOPS
                        that the volume supports.

                     KmsKeyId -> (string)
                        Identifier (key ID, key alias, ID ARN, or  alias  ARN)
                        for  a customer managed CMK under which the EBS volume
                        is encrypted.

                        This parameter is only supported on BlockDeviceMapping
                        objects  called  by  RunInstances , RequestSpotFleet ,
                        and RequestSpotInstances .

                     Throughput -> (integer)
                        The throughput that the volume supports, in MiB/s.

                        This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes.

                        Valid Range: Minimum value of 125.  Maximum  value  of
                        1000.

                     OutpostArn -> (string)
                        The  ARN  of  the  Outpost  on  which  the snapshot is
                        stored.

                        This parameter is not supported when using CreateImage
                        .

                     Encrypted -> (boolean)
                        Indicates  whether the encryption state of an EBS vol-
                        ume is changed while being  restored  from  a  backing
                        snapshot.  The  effect of setting the encryption state
                        to true depends on the volume origin (new  or  from  a
                        snapshot),  starting  encryption state, ownership, and
                        whether encryption by default is enabled. For more in-
                        formation, see Amazon EBS encryption in the Amazon EC2
                        User Guide .

                        In no case can you remove encryption from an encrypted
                        volume.

                        Encrypted  volumes  can  only be attached to instances
                        that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more  informa-
                        tion, see Supported instance types .

                        This  parameter  is  not returned by  DescribeImageAt-
                        tribute .

                        For  CreateImage and  RegisterImage , whether you  can
                        include  this parameter, and the allowed values differ
                        depending on the type of block device mapping you  are
                        creating.

                        o If you are creating a block device mapping for a new
                          (empty) volume , you can include this parameter, and
                          specify  either  true  for  an  encrypted volume, or
                          false for an unencrypted volume. If  you  omit  this
                          parameter, it defaults to false (unencrypted).

                        o If  you  are creating a block device mapping from an
                          existing encrypted or  unencrypted  snapshot  ,  you
                          must omit this parameter. If you include this param-
                          eter, the request will fail, regardless of the value
                          that you specify.

                        o If  you  are creating a block device mapping from an
                          existing unencrypted volume , you can  include  this
                          parameter, but you must specify false . If you spec-
                          ify true , the request will fail. In this  case,  we
                          recommend that you omit the parameter.

                        o If  you  are creating a block device mapping from an
                          existing encrypted volume , you can include this pa-
                          rameter, and specify either true or false . However,
                          if you specify false , the parameter is ignored  and
                          the  block  device  mapping  is always encrypted. In
                          this case, we recommend that you omit the parameter.

                 NoDevice -> (string)
                     To omit the device from the block device mapping, specify
                     an empty string. When this property is specified, the de-
                     vice is removed from the block device mapping  regardless
                     of the assigned value.

          EbsOptimized -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether  the  instance is optimized for EBS I/O. This
              optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS and  an
              optimized configuration stack to provide optimal EBS I/O perfor-
              mance. This  optimization  isn't  available  with  all  instance
              types.  Additional  usage  charges apply when using an EBS Opti-
              mized instance.

              Default: false

          IamInstanceProfile -> (structure)
              The IAM instance profile.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance profile.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the instance profile.

          ImageId -> (string)
              The ID of the AMI.

          InstanceType -> (string)
              The instance type. Only one instance type can be specified.

          KernelId -> (string)
              The ID of the kernel.

          KeyName -> (string)
              The name of the key pair.

          Monitoring -> (structure)
              Indicates whether basic or detailed monitoring  is  enabled  for
              the instance.

              Default: Disabled

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether detailed monitoring is enabled. Otherwise,
                 basic monitoring is enabled.

          NetworkInterfaces -> (list)
              The network interfaces. If you specify a network interface,  you
              must specify subnet IDs and security group IDs using the network
              interface.

              (structure)
                 Describes a network interface.

                 AssociatePublicIpAddress -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether to assign a public IPv4 address  to  an
                     instance  you  launch in a VPC. The public IP address can
                     only be assigned to a network interface for eth0, and can
                     only  be  assigned to a new network interface, not an ex-
                     isting one. You cannot specify more than one network  in-
                     terface  in the request. If launching into a default sub-
                     net, the default value is true .

                 DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                     If set to true , the interface is deleted  when  the  in-
                     stance is terminated. You can specify true only if creat-
                     ing a new network interface when launching an instance.

                 Description -> (string)
                     The description of the network interface. Applies only if
                     creating a network interface when launching an instance.

                 DeviceIndex -> (integer)
                     The  position  of the network interface in the attachment
                     order. A primary network interface has a device index  of
                     0.

                     If  you specify a network interface when launching an in-
                     stance, you must specify the device index.

                 Groups -> (list)
                     The IDs of the security groups for the network interface.
                     Applies only if creating a network interface when launch-

                     (string)

                 Ipv6AddressCount -> (integer)
                     A number of IPv6 addresses to assign to the  network  in-
                     terface.  Amazon  EC2 chooses the IPv6 addresses from the
                     range of the subnet. You cannot specify this  option  and
                     the  option to assign specific IPv6 addresses in the same
                     request. You can specify this option if you've  specified
                     a minimum number of instances to launch.

                 Ipv6Addresses -> (list)
                     The  IPv6  addresses  to assign to the network interface.
                     You cannot specify this option and the option to assign a
                     number  of IPv6 addresses in the same request. You cannot
                     specify this option if you've specified a minimum  number
                     of instances to launch.

                     (structure)
                        Describes an IPv6 address.

                        Ipv6Address -> (string)
                            The IPv6 address.

                        IsPrimaryIpv6 -> (boolean)
                            Determines  if  an  IPv6 address associated with a
                            network interface is  the  primary  IPv6  address.
                            When  you  enable an IPv6 GUA address to be a pri-
                            mary IPv6, the first IPv6 GUA  will  be  made  the
                            primary  IPv6 address until the instance is termi-
                            nated or the network interface  is  detached.  For
                            more information, see RunInstances .

                 NetworkInterfaceId -> (string)
                     The ID of the network interface.

                     If you are creating a Spot Fleet, omit this parameter be-
                     cause you cant specify a network interface ID in a launch
                     specification.

                 PrivateIpAddress -> (string)
                     The  private  IPv4  address of the network interface. Ap-
                     plies only if creating a network interface when launching
                     an  instance.  You  cannot  specify this option if you're
                     launching more than one instance in  a  RunInstances  re-
                     quest.

                 PrivateIpAddresses -> (list)
                     The  private  IPv4 addresses to assign to the network in-
                     terface. Only one private IPv4 address can be  designated
                     as  primary.  You  cannot  specify  this option if you're
                     launching more than one instance in  a  RunInstances  re-
                     quest.

                     (structure)
                        Describes  a secondary private IPv4 address for a net-
                        work interface.

                        Primary -> (boolean)
                            Indicates whether the private IPv4 address is  the
                            primary  private  IPv4  address. Only one IPv4 ad-
                            dress can be designated as primary.

                        PrivateIpAddress -> (string)
                            The private IPv4 address.

                 SecondaryPrivateIpAddressCount -> (integer)
                     The number of secondary private IPv4 addresses. You can't
                     specify  this option and specify more than one private IP
                     address using the private IP addresses option. You cannot
                     specify this option if you're launching more than one in-
                     stance in a RunInstances request.

                 SubnetId -> (string)
                     The ID of the subnet associated with the  network  inter-
                     face.  Applies  only if creating a network interface when
                     launching an instance.

                 AssociateCarrierIpAddress -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether to assign a carrier IP address  to  the
                     network interface.

                     You can only assign a carrier IP address to a network in-
                     terface that is in a subnet in  a  Wavelength  Zone.  For
                     more  information about carrier IP addresses, see Carrier
                     IP address in the Amazon Web Services  Wavelength  Devel-
                     oper Guide .

                     The type of network interface.

                     Valid values: interface | efa

                 NetworkCardIndex -> (integer)
                     The  index  of the network card. Some instance types sup-
                     port multiple network cards. The primary  network  inter-
                     face  must  be  assigned to network card index 0. The de-
                     fault is network card index 0.

                     If you are using RequestSpotInstances to create Spot  In-
                     stances, omit this parameter because you cant specify the
                     network card index when using this API.  To  specify  the
                     network card index, use RunInstances .

                 Ipv4Prefixes -> (list)
                     The IPv4 delegated prefixes to be assigned to the network
                     interface. You cannot use this  option  if  you  use  the
                     Ipv4PrefixCount option.

                     (structure)
                        Describes  the IPv4 prefix option for a network inter-
                        face.

                            The IPv4 prefix. For  information,  see  Assigning
                            prefixes  to  Amazon EC2 network interfaces in the
                            Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

                 Ipv4PrefixCount -> (integer)
                     The number of IPv4 delegated prefixes to be automatically
                     assigned  to  the  network interface. You cannot use this
                     option if you use the Ipv4Prefix option.

                 Ipv6Prefixes -> (list)
                     The IPv6 delegated prefixes to be assigned to the network
                     interface.  You  cannot  use  this  option if you use the
                     Ipv6PrefixCount option.

                     (structure)
                        Describes the IPv4 prefix option for a network  inter-

                     The number of IPv6 delegated prefixes to be automatically
                     assigned to the network interface. You  cannot  use  this
                     option if you use the Ipv6Prefix option.

                 PrimaryIpv6 -> (boolean)
                     The  primary  IPv6 address of the network interface. When
                     you enable an IPv6 GUA address to be a primary IPv6,  the
                     first  IPv6 GUA will be made the primary IPv6 address un-
                     til the instance is terminated or the  network  interface
                     is  detached. For more information about primary IPv6 ad-
                     dresses, see RunInstances .

       --spot-price (string)
          The maximum price per unit hour that you are willing to  pay  for  a
          Spot  Instance.  We do not recommend using this parameter because it
          can lead to increased interruptions. If you do not specify this  pa-
          rameter, you will pay the current Spot price.

          WARNING:
              If  you  specify  a maximum price, your instances will be inter-
              rupted more frequently than if you do not specify  this  parame-
              ter.

       --type (string)
          The Spot Instance request type.

          Default: one-time

          Possible values:

          o one-time

          o persistent

       --valid-from (timestamp)
          The  start  date  of the request. If this is a one-time request, the
          request becomes active at this date and time and remains active  un-
          til  all  instances  launch,  the request expires, or the request is
          canceled. If the request is persistent, the request  becomes  active
          at this date and time and remains active until it expires or is can-
          celed.

          The specified start date and time cannot be  equal  to  the  current
          date  and  time.  You must specify a start date and time that occurs
          after the current date and time.

       --valid-until (timestamp)
          The end date of the request, in UTC format (YYYY -MM -DD  T*HH*  :MM
          :SS Z).

          o For  a  persistent  request,  the request remains active until the
            ValidUntil date and time is reached. Otherwise,  the  request  re-
            mains active until you cancel it.

          o For  a  one-time request, the request remains active until all in-
            stances launch, the request is canceled, or  the  ValidUntil  date
            and  time  is reached. By default, the request is valid for 7 days
            from the date the request was created.

       --tag-specifications (list)
          The key-value pair for tagging the Spot  Instance  request  on  cre-
          ation.  The  value for ResourceType must be spot-instances-request ,
          otherwise the Spot Instance request fails. To tag the Spot  Instance
          request after it has been created, see CreateTags .

          (structure)
              The  tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being cre-
              ated. When you specify a tag, you must specify the resource type
              to tag, otherwise the request will fail.

              NOTE:
                 The  Valid  Values  lists  all the resource types that can be
                 tagged. However, the action you're using  might  not  support
                 tagging  all of these resource types. If you try to tag a re-
                 source type that is unsupported for the action you're  using,
                 you'll get an error.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to tag on creation.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags to apply to the resource.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a
                        maximum of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin  with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag values are case-sensitive and accept

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To request Spot Instances

       This  example command creates a one-time Spot Instance request for five
       instances in the specified Availability Zone.  If your account supports
       EC2-VPC  only,  Amazon EC2 launches the instances in the default subnet
       of the specified Availability Zone.  If your account supports EC2-Clas-
       sic,  Amazon EC2 launches the instances in EC2-Classic in the specified
       Availability Zone.

       Command:

          aws ec2 request-spot-instances --spot-price "0.03" --instance-count 5 --type "one-time" --launch-specification file://specification.json

       Specification.json:

                        EBS volumes and instance store volumes to attach to an
                        instance at launch.

                        DeviceName -> (string)
                            The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

                            The virtual device name  (ephemeral  N).  Instance
                            store volumes are numbered starting from 0. An in-
                            stance type with 2 available instance  store  vol-
                            umes  can  specify  mappings  for  ephemeral0  and
                            ephemeral1 .  The  number  of  available  instance
                            store  volumes depends on the instance type. After
                            you connect to the instance, you  must  mount  the
                            volume.

                            NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enu-
                            merated and assigned a device name. Including them
                            in your block device mapping has no effect.

                            Constraints:  For  M3  instances, you must specify
                            instance store volumes in the block device mapping
                            for  the instance. When you launch an M3 instance,
                            we ignore any instance store volumes specified  in
                            the block device mapping for the AMI.

                        Ebs -> (structure)
                            Parameters  used  to automatically set up EBS vol-
                            umes when the instance is launched.

                            DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                               Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted  on
                               instance termination. For more information, see

                            Iops -> (integer)
                               The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS).
                               For gp3 , io1 , and io2  volumes,  this  repre-
                               sents  the  number of IOPS that are provisioned
                               for the volume. For gp2  volumes,  this  repre-
                               sents  the  baseline  performance of the volume
                               and the rate at which  the  volume  accumulates
                               I/O credits for bursting.

                               The following are the supported values for each
                               volume type:

                               o gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS

                               o io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                               o io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                               For io1 and io2 volumes,  we  guarantee  64,000
                               IOPS only for Instances built on the Nitro Sys-
                               tem . Other instance families guarantee perfor-
                               mance up to 32,000 IOPS.

                               This parameter is required for io1 and io2 vol-
                               umes. The default  for  gp3  volumes  is  3,000
                               IOPS. This parameter is not supported for gp2 ,
                               st1 , sc1 , or standard volumes.

                            SnapshotId -> (string)
                               The ID of the snapshot.

                            VolumeSize -> (integer)
                               The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must spec-
                               ify  either  a snapshot ID or a volume size. If
                               you specify a  snapshot,  the  default  is  the
                               snapshot  size.  You  can specify a volume size
                               that is equal to or larger  than  the  snapshot
                               size.

                               The  following  are the supported volumes sizes
                               for each volume type:

                               o gp2 and gp3 :1-16,384

                               o io1 and io2 : 4-16,384

                               o st1 and sc1 : 125-16,384

                               o standard : 1-1,024

                            VolumeType -> (string)
                               The volume  type.  For  more  information,  see
                               Amazon  EBS volume types in the Amazon EC2 User
                               Guide . If the volume type is io1 or io2 ,  you
                               must specify the IOPS that the volume supports.

                            KmsKeyId -> (string)
                               Identifier (key ID, key alias, ID ARN, or alias
                               ARN) for a customer managed CMK under which the
                               EBS volume is encrypted.

                               This  parameter  is  only supported on BlockDe-
                               viceMapping objects called  by  RunInstances  ,
                               RequestSpotFleet , and RequestSpotInstances .

                            Throughput -> (integer)
                               The  throughput  that  the  volume supports, in
                               MiB/s.

                               This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes.

                               Valid Range:  Minimum  value  of  125.  Maximum
                               value of 1000.

                            OutpostArn -> (string)
                               The ARN of the Outpost on which the snapshot is
                               stored.

                               This parameter  is  not  supported  when  using
                               CreateImage .

                            Encrypted -> (boolean)
                               Indicates  whether  the  encryption state of an
                               EBS volume is changed while being restored from
                               a  backing  snapshot. The effect of setting the
                               encryption state to true depends on the  volume
                               origin  (new  or from a snapshot), starting en-
                               cryption state, ownership, and whether  encryp-
                               tion  by  default is enabled. For more informa-
                               tion, see Amazon EBS encryption in  the  Amazon
                               EC2 User Guide .

                               In  no  case  can you remove encryption from an
                               encrypted volume.

                               Encrypted volumes can only be attached  to  in-
                               stances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For
                               more information, see Supported instance  types
                               .

                               This  parameter is not returned by  DescribeIm-
                               ageAttribute .

                               For  CreateImage and  RegisterImage  ,  whether
                               you can include this parameter, and the allowed
                               values differ depending on the  type  of  block
                               device mapping you are creating.

                               o If  you  are  creating a block device mapping
                                 for a new (empty) volume ,  you  can  include
                                 this  parameter,  and specify either true for
                                 an encrypted volume, or false  for  an  unen-
                                 crypted  volume.  If you omit this parameter,
                                 it defaults to false (unencrypted).

                               o If you are creating a  block  device  mapping
                                 from  an  existing  encrypted  or unencrypted
                                 snapshot , you must omit this  parameter.  If
                                 you  include this parameter, the request will
                                 fail, regardless of the value that you  spec-
                                 ify.

                               o If  you  are  creating a block device mapping
                                 from an existing unencrypted volume , you can
                                 include  this parameter, but you must specify
                                 false . If you specify  true  ,  the  request
                                 will  fail.  In  this case, we recommend that
                                 you omit the parameter.

                               o If you are creating a  block  device  mapping
                                 from  an  existing encrypted volume , you can
                                 include this parameter,  and  specify  either
                                 true or false . However, if you specify false
                                 , the parameter is ignored and the block  de-
                                 vice  mapping  is  always  encrypted. In this
                                 case, we recommend that you omit the  parame-
                                 ter.

                        NoDevice -> (string)
                            To  omit the device from the block device mapping,
                            specify an empty string.  When  this  property  is
                            specified,  the  device  is removed from the block
                            device mapping regardless of the assigned value.

                 EbsOptimized -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether the instance is optimized for EBS  I/O.
                     This optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon
                     EBS and an optimized configuration stack to provide opti-
                     mal  EBS  I/O performance. This optimization isn't avail-
                     able with all instance types.  Additional  usage  charges
                     apply when using an EBS Optimized instance.

                     Default: false

                 IamInstanceProfile -> (structure)
                     The IAM instance profile.

                     Arn -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the instance pro-
                        file.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the instance profile.

                 ImageId -> (string)
                     The ID of the AMI.

                 InstanceType -> (string)
                     The instance type. Only one instance type can  be  speci-
                     fied.

                 KernelId -> (string)
                     The ID of the kernel.

                 KeyName -> (string)
                     The name of the key pair.

                 NetworkInterfaces -> (list)
                     The  network  interfaces. If you specify a network inter-
                     face, you must specify subnet IDs and security group  IDs
                     using the network interface.

                     (structure)
                        Describes a network interface.

                        AssociatePublicIpAddress -> (boolean)
                            Indicates  whether to assign a public IPv4 address
                            to an instance you launch in a VPC. The public  IP
                            address  can  only be assigned to a network inter-
                            face for eth0, and can only be assigned to  a  new
                            network interface, not an existing one. You cannot
                            specify more than one network interface in the re-
                            quest. If launching into a default subnet, the de-
                            fault value is true .

                        DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                            If set to true , the interface is deleted when the
                            instance  is terminated. You can specify true only
                            if creating a new network interface when launching
                            an instance.

                        Description -> (string)
                            The  description of the network interface. Applies
                            only if creating a network interface when  launch-
                            ing an instance.

                        DeviceIndex -> (integer)
                            The  position  of the network interface in the at-
                            tachment order. A primary network interface has  a
                            device index of 0.

                            If  you specify a network interface when launching
                            an instance, you must specify the device index.

                        Groups -> (list)
                            The IDs of the security groups for the network in-
                            terface. Applies only if creating a network inter-
                            face when launching an instance.

                            (string)

                        Ipv6AddressCount -> (integer)
                            A number of IPv6 addresses to assign to  the  net-
                            work  interface.  Amazon  EC2 chooses the IPv6 ad-
                            dresses from the range of the subnet.  You  cannot
                            specify  this option and the option to assign spe-
                            cific IPv6 addresses in the same request. You  can
                            specify  this option if you've specified a minimum
                            number of instances to launch.

                        Ipv6Addresses -> (list)
                            The IPv6 addresses to assign to the network inter-
                            face.  You  cannot specify this option and the op-
                            tion to assign a number of IPv6 addresses  in  the
                            same  request.  You  cannot specify this option if
                            you've specified a minimum number of instances  to
                            launch.

                            (structure)
                               Describes an IPv6 address.

                               Ipv6Address -> (string)
                                   The IPv6 address.

                               IsPrimaryIpv6 -> (boolean)
                                   Determines  if  an  IPv6 address associated
                                   with a network  interface  is  the  primary
                                   IPv6  address.  When you enable an IPv6 GUA
                                   address to be a  primary  IPv6,  the  first
                                   IPv6  GUA will be made the primary IPv6 ad-
                                   dress until the instance is  terminated  or
                                   the network interface is detached. For more
                                   information, see RunInstances .

                        NetworkInterfaceId -> (string)
                            The ID of the network interface.

                            If you are creating a Spot Fleet, omit this param-
                            eter  because you cant specify a network interface
                            ID in a launch specification.
