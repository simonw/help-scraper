NAME
       modify-instance-capacity-reservation-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  the Capacity Reservation settings for a stopped instance. Use
       this action to configure an instance  to  target  a  specific  Capacity
       Reservation,  run  in  any  open Capacity Reservation with matching at-
       tributes, or run On-Demand Instance capacity.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-instance-capacity-reservation-attributes
          --instance-id <value>
          --capacity-reservation-specification <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of the instance to be modified.

       --capacity-reservation-specification (structure)
          Information about the Capacity Reservation targeting option.

          CapacityReservationPreference -> (string)
              Indicates the instance's Capacity Reservation preferences.  Pos-
              sible preferences include:

              o open  -  The instance can run in any open Capacity Reservation
                that has matching attributes (instance type, platform,  Avail-
                ability Zone).

              o none  -  The instance avoids running in a Capacity Reservation
                even if one is available. The instance runs  as  an  On-Demand
                Instance.

          CapacityReservationTarget -> (structure)
              Information  about  the  target Capacity Reservation or Capacity
              Reservation group.

              CapacityReservationId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Capacity Reservation in which to  run  the  in-
                 stance.

              CapacityReservationResourceGroupArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of the Capacity Reservation resource group in which
                 to run the instance.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CapacityReservationPreference=string,CapacityReservationTarget={CapacityReservationId=string,CapacityReservationResourceGroupArn=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CapacityReservationPreference": "open"|"none",
            "CapacityReservationTarget": {
              "CapacityReservationId": "string",
              "CapacityReservationResourceGroupArn": "string"
            }
          }

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       Example  1: To modify an instance's capacity reservation targeting set-
       tings

       The following  modify-instance-capacity-reservation-attributes  example
       modifies a stopped instance to target a specific capacity reservation.

          aws ec2 modify-instance-capacity-reservation-attributes \
              --instance-id i-EXAMPLE8765abcd4e \
              --capacity-reservation-specification 'CapacityReservationTarget={CapacityReservationId= cr-1234abcd56EXAMPLE }'

       Output:

          {
              "Return": true
          }

       Example  2: To modify an instance's capacity reservation targeting set-
       tings

       The following  modify-instance-capacity-reservation-attributes  example
       modifies  a stopped instance that targets the specified capacity reser-
       vation to launch in any capacity  reservation  that  has  matching  at-
       tributes (instance type, platform, Availability Zone) and that has open
       instance matching criteria.

          aws ec2 modify-instance-capacity-reservation-attributes \
              --instance-id i-EXAMPLE8765abcd4e \
              --capacity-reservation-specification 'CapacityReservationPreference=open'

       Output:

          {
              "Return": true
          }

       Settings  in  the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide for Linux In-
       stances.

OUTPUT
       Return -> (boolean)
          Returns true if the request succeeds; otherwise, it returns  an  er-
          ror.
