ENABLE-FAST-LAUNCH()                                      ENABLE-FAST-LAUNCH()



NAME
       enable-fast-launch -

DESCRIPTION
       When you enable faster launching for a Windows AMI, images are pre-pro-
       visioned, using snapshots to launch instances up to 65% faster. To cre-
       ate  the  optimized  Windows image, Amazon EC2 launches an instance and
       runs through Sysprep steps, rebooting as required. Then  it  creates  a
       set  of  reserved  snapshots that are used for subsequent launches. The
       reserved snapshots are automatically replenished as they are used,  de-
       pending on your settings for launch frequency.

OPTIONS
       --image-id (string)
          The ID of the image for which youre enabling faster launching.

       --resource-type (string)
          The type of resource to use for pre-provisioning the Windows AMI for
          faster launching. Supported values include: snapshot , which is  the
          default value.

       --snapshot-configuration (structure)
          Configuration  settings for creating and managing the snapshots that
          are used for pre-provisioning the Windows AMI for faster  launching.
          The associated ResourceType must be snapshot .

          TargetResourceCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of  pre-provisioned snapshots to keep on hand for a
              fast-launch enabled Windows AMI.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TargetResourceCount=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TargetResourceCount": integer
          }

       --launch-template (structure)
          The launch template to use when  launching  Windows  instances  from
          pre-provisioned  snapshots.  Launch  template parameters can include
          either the name or ID of the launch template, but not both.

          LaunchTemplateId -> (string)
              The ID of the launch template to use for faster launching for  a
              Windows AMI.

          LaunchTemplateName -> (string)
              The  name of the launch template to use for faster launching for
              a Windows AMI.

          Version -> (string)
              The version of the launch template to use for  faster  launching
              for a Windows AMI.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          LaunchTemplateId=string,LaunchTemplateName=string,Version=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "LaunchTemplateId": "string",
            "LaunchTemplateName": "string",
            "Version": "string"
          }

       --max-parallel-launches (integer)
          The  maximum number of parallel instances to launch for creating re-
          sources.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
