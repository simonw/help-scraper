DESCRIBE-ROUTE-TABLES()                                DESCRIBE-ROUTE-TABLES()



NAME
       describe-route-tables -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes one or more of your route tables.

       Each  subnet  in  your  VPC must be associated with a route table. If a
       subnet is not explicitly associated with any route table, it is implic-
       itly associated with the main route table. This command does not return
       the subnet ID for implicit associations.

       For more information, see Route tables in the Amazon VPC User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-route-tables is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: RouteTables

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          The filters.

          o association.route-table-association-id  - The ID of an association
            ID for the route table.

          o association.route-table-id - The ID of the route table involved in
            the association.

          o association.subnet-id - The ID of the subnet involved in the asso-
            ciation.

          o association.main - Indicates whether the route table is  the  main
            route  table for the VPC (true | false ). Route tables that do not
            have an association ID are not returned in the response.

          o owner-id - The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the
            route table.

          o route-table-id - The ID of the route table.

          o route.destination-cidr-block  - The IPv4 CIDR range specified in a
            route in the table.

          o route.destination-ipv6-cidr-block - The IPv6 CIDR range  specified
            in a route in the route table.

          o route.destination-prefix-list-id  -  The ID (prefix) of the Amazon
            Web Service specified in a route in the table.

          o route.egress-only-internet-gateway-id - The ID of  an  egress-only
            Internet gateway specified in a route in the route table.

          o route.gateway-id - The ID of a gateway specified in a route in the
            table.

          o route.instance-id - The ID of an instance specified in a route  in
            the table.

          o route.nat-gateway-id - The ID of a NAT gateway.

          o route.transit-gateway-id - The ID of a transit gateway.

          o route.origin  -  Describes  how  the  route  was created. CreateR-
            outeTable indicates that the route was automatically created  when
            the  route table was created; CreateRoute indicates that the route
            was manually added to the route  table;  EnableVgwRoutePropagation
            indicates that the route was propagated by route propagation.

          o route.state  -  The  state of a route in the route table (active |
            blackhole ). The blackhole state indicates that the route's target
            isn't available (for example, the specified gateway isn't attached
            to the VPC, the specified NAT instance has been terminated, and so
            on).

          o route.vpc-peering-connection-id  - The ID of a VPC peering connec-
            tion specified in a route in the table.

          o tag :<key> - The key/value combination of a tag  assigned  to  the
            resource.  Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as
            the filter value. For example, to find all resources that  have  a
            tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for
            the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

          o tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this fil-
            ter  to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, re-
            gardless of the tag value.

          o vpc-id - The ID of the VPC for the route table.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --route-table-ids (list)
          The IDs of the route tables.

          Default: Describes all your route tables.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
