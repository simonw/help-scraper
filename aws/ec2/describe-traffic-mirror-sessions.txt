NAME
       describe-traffic-mirror-sessions -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  one or more Traffic Mirror sessions. By default, all Traffic
       Mirror sessions are described. Alternatively, you can  filter  the  re-
       sults.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-traffic-mirror-sessions is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: TrafficMirrorSessions

SYNOPSIS
            describe-traffic-mirror-sessions
          [--traffic-mirror-session-ids <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --traffic-mirror-session-ids (list)
          The ID of the Traffic Mirror session.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters. The possible values are:

          o description : The Traffic Mirror session description.

          o network-interface-id  :  The ID of the Traffic Mirror session net-
            work interface.

          o owner-id : The ID of the account that owns the Traffic Mirror ses-
            sion.

          o packet-length : The assigned number of packets to mirror.

          o session-number : The assigned session number.

          o traffic-mirror-filter-id : The ID of the Traffic Mirror filter.

          o traffic-mirror-session-id : The ID of the Traffic Mirror session.

          o traffic-mirror-target-id : The ID of the Traffic Mirror target.

          o virtual-network-id  : The virtual network ID of the Traffic Mirror
            session.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TrafficMirrorSessions -> (list)
          Describes one or more Traffic Mirror sessions. By default, all Traf-
          fic Mirror sessions are described. Alternatively, you can filter the
          results.

          (structure)
              Describes a Traffic Mirror session.

              TrafficMirrorSessionId -> (string)
                 The ID for the Traffic Mirror session.

              TrafficMirrorTargetId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Traffic Mirror target.

              TrafficMirrorFilterId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Traffic Mirror filter.

              NetworkInterfaceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Traffic Mirror session's network interface.

              OwnerId -> (string)
                 The ID of the account that owns the Traffic Mirror session.

              PacketLength -> (integer)
                 The  number  of bytes in each packet to mirror. These are the
                 bytes after the VXLAN header. To mirror a subset, set this to
                 the length (in bytes) to mirror. For example, if you set this
                 value to 100, then the first 100 bytes that meet  the  filter
                 criteria are copied to the target. Do not specify this param-
                 eter when you want to mirror the entire packet

              SessionNumber -> (integer)
                 The session number determines the order in which sessions are
                 evaluated when an interface is used by multiple sessions. The
                 first session with a matching filter is the one that  mirrors
                 the packets.

                 Valid values are 1-32766.

              VirtualNetworkId -> (integer)
                 The  virtual  network  ID  associated with the Traffic Mirror
                 session.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the Traffic Mirror session.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags assigned to the Traffic Mirror session.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept  a
                        maximum  of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and  accept
                        a maximum of 255 Unicode characters.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token to use to retrieve the next page of results. The value is
          null when there are no more results to return.
