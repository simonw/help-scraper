CREATE-TRAFFIC-MIRROR-FILTER()                  CREATE-TRAFFIC-MIRROR-FILTER()



NAME
       create-traffic-mirror-filter -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a Traffic Mirror filter.

       A  Traffic  Mirror filter is a set of rules that defines the traffic to
       mirror.

       By  default,  no  traffic  is  mirrored.   To   mirror   traffic,   use
       CreateTrafficMirrorFilterRule  to  add Traffic Mirror rules to the fil-
       ter. The rules you add define what traffic gets mirrored. You can  also
       use  ModifyTrafficMirrorFilterNetworkServices  to mirror supported net-
       work services.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

            {
              "ResourceType": "capacity-reservation"|"client-vpn-endpoint"|"customer-gateway"|"carrier-gateway"|"dedicated-host"|"dhcp-options"|"egress-only-internet-gateway"|"elastic-ip"|"elastic-gpu"|"export-image-task"|"export-instance-task"|"fleet"|"fpga-image"|"host-reservation"|"image"|"import-image-task"|"import-snapshot-task"|"instance"|"instance-event-window"|"internet-gateway"|"ipam"|"ipam-pool"|"ipam-scope"|"ipv4pool-ec2"|"ipv6pool-ec2"|"key-pair"|"launch-template"|"local-gateway"|"local-gateway-route-table"|"local-gateway-virtual-interface"|"local-gateway-virtual-interface-group"|"local-gateway-route-table-vpc-association"|"local-gateway-route-table-virtual-interface-group-association"|"natgateway"|"network-acl"|"network-interface"|"network-insights-analysis"|"network-insights-path"|"network-insights-access-scope"|"network-insights-access-scope-analysis"|"placement-group"|"prefix-list"|"replace-root-volume-task"|"reserved-instances"|"route-table"|"security-group"|"security-group-rule"|"snapshot"|"spot-fleet-request"|"spot-instances-request"|"subnet"|"subnet-cidr-reservation"|"traffic-mirror-filter"|"traffic-mirror-session"|"traffic-mirror-target"|"transit-gateway"|"transit-gateway-attachment"|"transit-gateway-connect-peer"|"transit-gateway-multicast-domain"|"transit-gateway-policy-table"|"transit-gateway-route-table"|"transit-gateway-route-table-announcement"|"volume"|"vpc"|"vpc-endpoint"|"vpc-endpoint-service"|"vpc-peering-connection"|"vpn-connection"|"vpn-gateway"|"vpc-flow-log",
              "Tags": [
                {
                  "Key": "string",
                  "Value": "string"
                }
                ...
              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. For more information, see How to  ensure
          idempotency .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To create a Traffic Mirror Filter

       The following create-traffic-mirror-filter example  creates  a  Traffic
       Mirror  filter.  After  you  create the filter, use create-traffic-mir-
       ror-filter-rule to add rules to the filter.

          aws ec2 create-traffic-mirror-filter \
              --description "TCP Filter"

       Output:

          {
