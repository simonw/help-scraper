DESCRIBE-EXPORT-IMAGE-TASKS()                    DESCRIBE-EXPORT-IMAGE-TASKS()



NAME
       describe-export-image-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the specified export image tasks or all of your export image
       tasks.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-export-image-tasks is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: ExportImageTasks

SYNOPSIS
            describe-export-image-tasks
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--export-image-task-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --filters (list)
          Filter tasks using the task-state filter and one  of  the  following
          values: active , completed , deleting , or deleted .

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --export-image-task-ids (list)
          The IDs of the export image tasks.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To monitor an export image task

       The following describe-export-image-tasks example checks the status  of
       the specified export image task.

          aws ec2 describe-export-image-tasks \
              --export-image-task-id export-ami-1234567890abcdef0

       Output for an export image task that is in progress:

          {
              "ExportImageTasks": [
                  {
                      "ExportImageTaskId": "export-ami-1234567890abcdef0"
                      "Progress": "21",
                      "S3ExportLocation": {
                          "S3Bucket": "my-export-bucket",
                          "S3Prefix": "exports/"
                      },
                      "Status": "active",
                      "StatusMessage": "updating"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Output  for an export image task that is completed. The resulting image
       file     in     Amazon     S3      is      my-export-bucket/exports/ex-
       port-ami-1234567890abcdef0.vmdk.

          {
              "ExportImageTasks": [
                  {
                      "ExportImageTaskId": "export-ami-1234567890abcdef0"
                      "S3ExportLocation": {
                          "S3Bucket": "my-export-bucket",
                          "S3Prefix": "exports/"
                      },
                      "Status": "completed"
                  }
              ]
