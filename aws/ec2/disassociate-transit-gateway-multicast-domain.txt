DISASSOCIATE-TRANSIT-GATEWAY-MUDISASSOCIATE-TRANSIT-GATEWAY-MULTICAST-DOMAIN()



NAME
       disassociate-transit-gateway-multicast-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       Disassociates  the specified subnets from the transit gateway multicast
       domain.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-transit-gateway-multicast-domain
          [--transit-gateway-multicast-domain-id <value>]
          [--transit-gateway-attachment-id <value>]
          [--subnet-ids <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --transit-gateway-multicast-domain-id (string)
          The ID of the transit gateway multicast domain.

       --transit-gateway-attachment-id (string)
          The ID of the attachment.

       --subnet-ids (list)
          The IDs of the subnets;

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To disassociate subnets from a multicast domain

       The  following  disassociate-transit-gateway-multicast-domain   example
       disassociates a subnet from the specified multicast domain.

          aws ec2 disassociate-transit-gateway-multicast-domain \
              --transit-gateway-attachment-id tgw-attach-070e571cd1EXAMPLE \
              --subnet-id subnet-000de86e3bEXAMPLE \
              --transit-gateway-multicast-domain-id tgw-mcast-domain-0c4905cef7EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "Associations": {
                  "TransitGatewayMulticastDomainId": "tgw-mcast-domain-0c4905cef7EXAMPLE",
                  "TransitGatewayAttachmentId": "tgw-attach-070e571cd1EXAMPLE",
                  "ResourceId": "vpc-7EXAMPLE",
                  "ResourceType": "vpc",
                  "Subnets": [
                      {
                          "SubnetId": "subnet-000de86e3bEXAMPLE",
                          "State": "disassociating"
                      }
                  ]
              }
          }
