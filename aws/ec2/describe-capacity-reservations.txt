NAME
       describe-capacity-reservations -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  one  or  more of your Capacity Reservations. The results de-
       scribe only the Capacity Reservations in the Amazon Web Services Region
       that you're currently using.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-capacity-reservations  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: CapacityReservations

OPTIONS
       --capacity-reservation-ids (list)
          The ID of the Capacity Reservation.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters.

          o instance-type - The type of instance for which the Capacity Reser-
            vation reserves capacity.

          o owner-id - The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the
            Capacity Reservation.

          o instance-platform - The type of operating system for which the Ca-
            pacity Reservation reserves capacity.

          o availability-zone - The Availability Zone of the Capacity Reserva-
            tion.

          o tenancy - Indicates the tenancy of the Capacity Reservation. A Ca-
            pacity Reservation can have one of the following tenancy settings:

            o default  -  The Capacity Reservation is created on hardware that
              is shared with other Amazon Web Services accounts.

            o dedicated - The Capacity Reservation is created on single-tenant
              hardware  that  is dedicated to a single Amazon Web Services ac-
              count.

          o outpost-arn - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  Outpost  on
            which the Capacity Reservation was created.

          o state  - The current state of the Capacity Reservation. A Capacity
            Reservation can be in one of the following states:

            o active - The Capacity Reservation is active and the capacity  is
              available for your use.

            o expired  - The Capacity Reservation expired automatically at the
              date and time specified in your request. The  reserved  capacity
              is no longer available for your use.

            o cancelled - The Capacity Reservation was cancelled. The reserved
              capacity is no longer available for your use.

            o pending - The Capacity Reservation request  was  successful  but
              the capacity provisioning is still pending.

            o failed  - The Capacity Reservation request has failed. A request
              might fail due to  invalid  request  parameters,  capacity  con-
              straints, or instance limit constraints. Failed requests are re-
              tained for 60 minutes.

          o start-date - The date and time at which the  Capacity  Reservation
            was started.

          o end-date - The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation ex-
            pires. When a Capacity Reservation expires, the reserved  capacity
            is  released  and  you can no longer launch instances into it. The
            Capacity Reservation's state changes to expired  when  it  reaches
            its end date and time.

          o end-date-type  -  Indicates the way in which the Capacity Reserva-
            tion ends. A Capacity Reservation can have one  of  the  following
            end types:

            o unlimited  -  The  Capacity Reservation remains active until you
              explicitly cancel it.

            o limited - The Capacity Reservation expires  automatically  at  a
              specified date and time.

          o instance-match-criteria  - Indicates the type of instance launches
            that the Capacity Reservation accepts. The options include:

            o open - The Capacity Reservation accepts all instances that  have
              matching  attributes  (instance type, platform, and Availability
              Zone). Instances that have matching attributes launch  into  the
              Capacity  Reservation automatically without specifying any addi-
              tional parameters.

            o targeted - The Capacity Reservation only accepts instances  that
              have  matching  attributes  (instance type, platform, and Avail-
              ability Zone), and explicitly target the  Capacity  Reservation.
              This  ensures that only permitted instances can use the reserved
              capacity.

          o placement-group-arn - The ARN of the cluster  placement  group  in
            which the Capacity Reservation was created.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       CapacityReservations -> (list)
          Information about the Capacity Reservations.

          (structure)
              Describes a Capacity Reservation.

              CapacityReservationId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Capacity Reservation.

              OwnerId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the Ca-
                 pacity Reservation.

              CapacityReservationArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Capacity Reservation.

              AvailabilityZoneId -> (string)
                 The Availability Zone ID of the Capacity Reservation.

              InstanceType -> (string)
                 The type of instance for which the Capacity  Reservation  re-
                 serves capacity.

              InstancePlatform -> (string)
                 The  type of operating system for which the Capacity Reserva-
                 tion reserves capacity.

              AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                 The Availability Zone in which the capacity is reserved.

              Tenancy -> (string)
                 Indicates the tenancy of the Capacity Reservation. A Capacity
                 Reservation can have one of the following tenancy settings:

                 o default  -  The Capacity Reservation is created on hardware
                   that is shared with other Amazon Web Services accounts.

                 o dedicated - The Capacity Reservation  is  created  on  sin-
                   gle-tenant  hardware  that  is dedicated to a single Amazon
                   Web Services account.

              TotalInstanceCount -> (integer)
                 The total number of instances for which the Capacity Reserva-
                 tion reserves capacity.

              AvailableInstanceCount -> (integer)
                 The  remaining  capacity.  Indicates  the number of instances
                 that can be launched in the Capacity Reservation.

              EbsOptimized -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the Capacity Reservation supports EBS-opti-
                 mized   instances.   This   optimization  provides  dedicated
                 throughput to Amazon EBS and an optimized configuration stack
                 to  provide  optimal I/O performance. This optimization isn't
                 available with all instance types. Additional  usage  charges
                 apply when using an EBS- optimized instance.

              EphemeralStorage -> (boolean)
                 Deprecated.

              State -> (string)
                 The  current  state  of  the Capacity Reservation. A Capacity
                 Reservation can be in one of the following states:

                 o active - The Capacity Reservation is active and the  capac-
                   ity is available for your use.

                 o expired - The Capacity Reservation expired automatically at
                   the date and time specified in your request.  The  reserved
                   capacity is no longer available for your use.

                 o cancelled - The Capacity Reservation was cancelled. The re-
                   served capacity is no longer available for your use.

                 o pending - The Capacity Reservation request  was  successful
                   but the capacity provisioning is still pending.

                 o failed - The Capacity Reservation request has failed. A re-
                   quest might fail due to invalid request parameters,  capac-
                   ity  constraints, or instance limit constraints. Failed re-
                   quests are retained for 60 minutes.

              StartDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time  at  which  the  Capacity  Reservation  was
                 started.

              EndDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date and time at which the Capacity Reservation expires.
                 When a Capacity Reservation expires, the reserved capacity is
                 released  and you can no longer launch instances into it. The
                 Capacity Reservation's  state  changes  to  expired  when  it
                 reaches its end date and time.

              EndDateType -> (string)
                 Indicates  the  way in which the Capacity Reservation ends. A
                 Capacity Reservation can have one of the following end types:

                 o unlimited - The Capacity Reservation remains  active  until
                   you explicitly cancel it.

                 o limited - The Capacity Reservation expires automatically at
                   a specified date and time.

              InstanceMatchCriteria -> (string)
                 Indicates the type of instance  launches  that  the  Capacity
                 Reservation accepts. The options include:

                 o open  - The Capacity Reservation accepts all instances that
                   have matching  attributes  (instance  type,  platform,  and
                   Availability Zone). Instances that have matching attributes
                   launch into the Capacity Reservation automatically  without
                   specifying any additional parameters.

                 o targeted  - The Capacity Reservation only accepts instances
                   that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and
                   Availability  Zone),  and  explicitly  target  the Capacity
                   Reservation. This ensures that only permitted instances can
                   use the reserved capacity.

              CreateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date and time at which the Capacity Reservation was cre-
                 ated.

              Tags -> (list)
                 Any tags assigned to the Capacity Reservation.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.
