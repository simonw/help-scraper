NAME
       search-transit-gateway-routes -

DESCRIPTION
       Searches for routes in the specified transit gateway route table.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            search-transit-gateway-routes
          --transit-gateway-route-table-id <value>
          --filters <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --transit-gateway-route-table-id (string)
          The ID of the transit gateway route table.

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters. The possible values are:

          o attachment.transit-gateway-attachment-id  -  The id of the transit
            gateway attachment.

          o attachment.resource-id - The resource id of  the  transit  gateway
            attachment.

          o attachment.resource-type  -  The  attachment  resource type. Valid
            values are vpc | vpn | direct-connect-gateway | peering |  connect
            .

          o prefix-list-id - The ID of the prefix list.

          o route-search.exact-match  -  The exact match of the specified fil-
            ter.

          o route-search.longest-prefix-match  -  The  longest   prefix   that
            matches the route.

          o route-search.subnet-of-match - The routes with a subnet that match
            the specified CIDR filter.

          o route-search.supernet-of-match - The routes with a CIDR  that  en-
            compass  the CIDR filter. For example, if you have 10.0.1.0/29 and
            10.0.1.0/31 routes in your route  table  and  you  specify  super-
            net-of-match as 10.0.1.0/30, then the result returns 10.0.1.0/29.

          o state - The state of the route (active | blackhole ).

          o type - The type of route (propagated | static ).

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of routes to return.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To search for routes in the specified transit gateway route table

       The  following  search-transit-gateway-routes  example  returns all the
       routes that are of type static in the specified route table.

          aws ec2 search-transit-gateway-routes \
              --transit-gateway-route-table-id tgw-rtb-0a823edbdeEXAMPLE \
              --filters "Name=type,Values=static"

       Output:

          {
              "Routes": [
                  {
                      "DestinationCidrBlock": "10.0.2.0/24",
                      "TransitGatewayAttachments": [
                          {
                              "ResourceId": "vpc-4EXAMPLE",
                              "TransitGatewayAttachmentId": "tgw-attach-09b52ccdb5EXAMPLE",
                              "ResourceType": "vpc"
                          }
                      ],
                      "Type": "static",
                      "State": "active"
                  },
                  {

                          }
                      ],
                      "Type": "static",
                      "State": "active"
                  }
