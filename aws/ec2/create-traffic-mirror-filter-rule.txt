NAME
       create-traffic-mirror-filter-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a Traffic Mirror filter rule.

       A Traffic Mirror rule defines the Traffic Mirror source traffic to mir-
       ror.

       You need the Traffic Mirror filter ID when you create the rule.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          o ingress

          o egress

       --rule-number (integer)
          The number of the Traffic Mirror rule. This number  must  be  unique
          for  each  Traffic  Mirror  rule in a given direction. The rules are
          processed in ascending order by rule number.

          The action to take on the filtered traffic.

          Possible values:

          o accept

          o reject

       --destination-port-range (structure)
          The destination port range.

          FromPort -> (integer)
              The first port in the Traffic Mirror port range. This applies to
              the TCP and UDP protocols.

          ToPort -> (integer)
              The  last port in the Traffic Mirror port range. This applies to
              the TCP and UDP protocols.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FromPort=integer,ToPort=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FromPort": integer,
            "ToPort": integer
          }

       --source-port-range (structure)
          The source port range.

          FromPort -> (integer)
              The first port in the Traffic Mirror port range. This applies to
              the TCP and UDP protocols.

          ToPort -> (integer)
              The  last port in the Traffic Mirror port range. This applies to
              the TCP and UDP protocols.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FromPort=integer,ToPort=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FromPort": integer,
            "ToPort": integer
          }

       --protocol (integer)
          The protocol, for example UDP, to assign to the Traffic Mirror rule.

          For information about the protocol value, see  Protocol  Numbers  on
          the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) website.

       --destination-cidr-block (string)
          The destination CIDR block to assign to the Traffic Mirror rule.

       --source-cidr-block (string)
          The source CIDR block to assign to the Traffic Mirror rule.

       --description (string)
          The description of the Traffic Mirror rule.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency  of the request. For more information, see How to ensure
          idempotency .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a filter rule for incoming TCP traffic

       The following create-traffic-mirror-filter-rule example creates a  rule
       that  you  can  use  to mirror all incoming TCP traffic. Before you run
       this command, use create-traffic-mirror-filter to create the the  Traf-
       fic Mirror filter.

          aws ec2 create-traffic-mirror-filter-rule \
              --description "TCP Rule" \
              --destination-cidr-block 0.0.0.0/0  \
              --protocol 6 \
              --rule-action accept \
              --rule-number 1 \
              --source-cidr-block 0.0.0.0/0 \
              --traffic-direction ingress \
              --traffic-mirror-filter-id tmf-04812ff784b25ae67

       Output:

          {
              "TrafficMirrorFilterRule": {
                  "DestinationCidrBlock": "0.0.0.0/0",
                  "TrafficMirrorFilterId": "tmf-04812ff784b25ae67",
                  "TrafficMirrorFilterRuleId": "tmfr-02d20d996673f3732",
