NAME
       describe-security-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified security groups or all of your security groups.

       A  security  group  is for use with instances either in the EC2-Classic
       platform or in a specific VPC. For more information, see Amazon EC2 se-
       curity  groups  in  the  Amazon  Elastic  Compute  Cloud User Guide and
       Security groups for your VPC in the Amazon Virtual Private  Cloud  User
       Guide .

       NOTE:
          We  are  retiring  EC2-Classic on August 15, 2022. We recommend that
          you migrate from EC2-Classic to a VPC.  For  more  information,  see
          Migrate  from  EC2-Classic  to  a  VPC in the Amazon Elastic Compute
          Cloud User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-security-groups is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: SecurityGroups

            resource.  Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as
            the filter value. For example, to find all resources that  have  a
            tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for
            the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

          o tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this fil-
            ter  to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, re-
            gardless of the tag value.

          o vpc-id - The ID of the VPC specified when the security  group  was
            created.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --group-ids (list)
          The  IDs  of  the security groups. Required for security groups in a
          nondefault VPC.

          Default: Describes all of your security groups.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --group-names (list)
          [EC2-Classic and default VPC only] The names of the security groups.
          You can specify either the security group name or the security group
          ID. For security groups in a nondefault VPC, use the group-name fil-
          ter to describe security groups by name.

          Default: Describes all of your security groups.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To describe a security group

       The  following describe-security-groups example describes the specified
       security group.

          aws ec2 describe-security-groups \
              --group-ids sg-903004f8

       Output:

                                      "GroupId": "sg-903004f8"
                                  }
                              ],
                              "PrefixListIds": []
                          },
                          {
                              "PrefixListIds": [],
                              "FromPort": 22,
                              "IpRanges": [
                                  {

                                      "CidrIp": "203.0.113.0/24"
                                  }

                      "GroupId": "sg-903004f8",
                  }
              ]
          }

       Example 2: To describe security groups that have specific rules

       The following describe-security-groups``example uses filters  to  scope
       the results to security groups that have a rule that allows SSH traffic
       (port  22)  and  a  rule  that  allows  traffic  from   all   addresses
       (``0.0.0.0/0).  The  example uses the --query parameter to display only
       the names of the security groups. Security groups must match  all  fil-
       ters  to  be  returned  in the results; however, a single rule does not
       have to match all filters. For example, the output returns  a  security
       group  with  a  rule that allows SSH traffic from a specific IP address
       and another rule that allows HTTP traffic from all addresses.

          aws ec2 describe-security-groups \
              --filters Name=ip-permission.from-port,Values=22 Name=ip-permission.to-port,Values=22 Name=ip-permission.cidr,Values='0.0.0.0/0' \
              --query "SecurityGroups[*].[GroupName]" \
              --output text

       Output:

          default
          my-security-group
          web-servers
          launch-wizard-1

       Example 3: To describe security groups based on tags

       The following describe-security-groups example uses  filters  to  scope
       the  results to security groups that include test in the security group
       name, and that have  the  tag  Test=To-delete.  The  example  uses  the
       --query  parameter  to  display  only the names and IDs of the security
       groups.

          aws ec2 describe-security-groups \
              --filters Name=group-name,Values=*test* Name=tag:Test,Values=To-delete \
              --query "SecurityGroups[*].{Name:GroupName,ID:GroupId}"

       Output:

          [
              {
                  "Name": "testfornewinstance",
                  "ID": "sg-33bb22aa"
              },
              {
                  "Name": "newgrouptest",
                  "ID": "sg-1a2b3c4d"
              }
          ]

       For additional examples using tag filters, see Working with tags in the
       Amazon EC2 User Guide.

OUTPUT
       SecurityGroups -> (list)
          Information about the security groups.

          (structure)
              Describes a security group.

              Description -> (string)
                 A description of the security group.

              GroupName -> (string)
                 The name of the security group.

              IpPermissions -> (list)
                 The inbound rules associated with the security group.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a set of permissions for a security group rule.

                     FromPort -> (integer)
                        The start of port range for the TCP and UDP protocols,
                        or an ICMP/ICMPv6 type number. A value of -1 indicates
                        all  ICMP/ICMPv6 types. If you specify all ICMP/ICMPv6
                        types, you must specify all codes.

                     IpProtocol -> (string)
                        The IP protocol name (tcp , udp , icmp , icmpv6  )  or
                        number (see Protocol Numbers ).

                        [VPC  only]  Use -1 to specify all protocols. When au-
                        thorizing security group rules,  specifying  -1  or  a
                        protocol  number  other  than  tcp  ,  udp , icmp , or
                        icmpv6 allows traffic on all ports, regardless of  any
                        port range you specify. For tcp , udp , and icmp , you
                        must specify a port range. For icmpv6 , the port range
                        is  optional;  if you omit the port range, traffic for
                        all types and codes is allowed.

                     IpRanges -> (list)
                        The IPv4 ranges.

                        (structure)
                            Describes an IPv4 range.

                            CidrIp -> (string)
