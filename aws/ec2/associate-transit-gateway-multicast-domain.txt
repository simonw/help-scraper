ASSOCIATE-TRANSIT-GATEWAY-MULTICASASSOCIATE-TRANSIT-GATEWAY-MULTICAST-DOMAIN()



NAME
       associate-transit-gateway-multicast-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  the  specified subnets and transit gateway attachments with
       the specified transit gateway multicast domain.

       The transit gateway attachment must be in the  available  state  before
       you  can  add  a resource. Use DescribeTransitGatewayAttachments to see
       the state of the attachment.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            associate-transit-gateway-multicast-domain
          [--transit-gateway-multicast-domain-id <value>]
          [--transit-gateway-attachment-id <value>]
          [--subnet-ids <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --transit-gateway-multicast-domain-id (string)
          The ID of the transit gateway multicast domain.

       --transit-gateway-attachment-id (string)
          The ID of the transit gateway attachment to associate with the tran-
          sit gateway multicast domain.

       --subnet-ids (list)
          The  IDs of the subnets to associate with the transit gateway multi-
          cast domain.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To associate a transit gateway with a multicast domain

       The  following associate-transit-gateway-multicast-domain example asso-
       ciates the specified subnet and attachment with the specified multicast
       domain.

          aws ec2 associate-transit-gateway-multicast-domain \
              --transit-gateway-multicast-domain-id tgw-mcast-domain-0c4905cef79d6e597 \
              --transit-gateway-attachment-id tgw-attach-028c1dd0f8f5cbe8e \
              --subnet-ids subnet-000de86e3b49c932a \
              --transit-gateway-multicast-domain-id tgw-mcast-domain-0c4905cef7EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {

                  "TransitGatewayMulticastDomainId": "tgw-mcast-domain-0c4905cef79d6e597",
                  "TransitGatewayAttachmentId": "tgw-attach-028c1dd0f8f5cbe8e",

                      {
                          "SubnetId": "subnet-000de86e3b49c932a",
                          "State": "associating"
                      }
                  ]
              }
          }
