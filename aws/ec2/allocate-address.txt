ALLOCATE-ADDRESS()                                          ALLOCATE-ADDRESS()



NAME
       allocate-address -

DESCRIPTION
       Allocates  an  Elastic  IP address to your Amazon Web Services account.
       After you allocate the Elastic IP address you can associate it with  an
       instance or network interface. After you release an Elastic IP address,
       it is released to the IP address pool and can be allocated to a differ-
       ent Amazon Web Services account.

       You  can  allocate  an Elastic IP address from an address pool owned by
       Amazon Web Services or from an address pool created from a public  IPv4
       address range that you have brought to Amazon Web Services for use with
       your Amazon Web Services resources using bring your  own  IP  addresses
       (BYOIP).  For more information, see Bring Your Own IP Addresses (BYOIP)
       in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

       [EC2-VPC] If you release an Elastic IP address, you might  be  able  to
       recover  it. You cannot recover an Elastic IP address that you released
       after it is allocated to another Amazon Web Services account. You  can-
       not  recover  an  Elastic IP address for EC2-Classic. To attempt to re-
       cover an Elastic IP address that you released, specify it in this oper-
       ation.

       An  Elastic IP address is for use either in the EC2-Classic platform or
       in a VPC. By default, you can  allocate  5  Elastic  IP  addresses  for
       EC2-Classic  per  Region and 5 Elastic IP addresses for EC2-VPC per Re-
       gion.

       For more information, see Elastic IP Addresses in  the  Amazon  Elastic
       Compute Cloud User Guide .

       You can allocate a carrier IP address which is a public IP address from
       a telecommunication carrier, to a network interface which resides in  a
       subnet in a Wavelength Zone (for example an EC2 instance).

       NOTE:
          We  are  retiring  EC2-Classic on August 15, 2022. We recommend that
          you migrate from EC2-Classic to a VPC.  For  more  information,  see
          Migrate  from  EC2-Classic  to  a  VPC in the Amazon Elastic Compute
          Cloud User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            allocate-address
          [--domain <value>]
          [--address <value>]
          [--public-ipv4-pool <value>]
          [--network-border-group <value>]
          [--customer-owned-ipv4-pool <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--tag-specifications <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          Indicates whether the Elastic IP address is for use  with  instances
          in a VPC or instances in EC2-Classic.

          Default: If the Region supports EC2-Classic, the default is standard
          . Otherwise, the default is vpc .

          Possible values:

          o vpc

          o standard

       --address (string)
          [EC2-VPC] The Elastic IP address to recover or an IPv4 address  from
          an address pool.

       --public-ipv4-pool (string)
          The  ID  of  an address pool that you own. Use this parameter to let
          Amazon EC2 select an address from the address  pool.  To  specify  a
          specific  address  from  the address pool, use the Address parameter
          instead.

       --network-border-group (string)
          A unique set of Availability Zones, Local Zones, or Wavelength Zones
          from which Amazon Web Services advertises IP addresses. Use this pa-
          rameter to limit the IP address to this location. IP addresses  can-
          not move between network border groups.

          Use DescribeAvailabilityZones to view the network border groups.

          You  cannot  use a network border group with EC2 Classic. If you at-
          tempt this operation on EC2 Classic, you receive  an  InvalidParame-
          terCombination error.

       --customer-owned-ipv4-pool (string)
          The  ID  of a customer-owned address pool. Use this parameter to let
          Amazon EC2 select an address from the address  pool.  Alternatively,
          specify a specific address from the address pool.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --tag-specifications (list)
          The tags to assign to the Elastic IP address.

          (structure)
              The tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being  cre-
              ated.

              NOTE:
                 The  Valid  Values  lists  all the resource types that can be
                 tagged. However, the action you're using  might  not  support
                 tagging  all of these resource types. If you try to tag a re-
                 source type that is unsupported for the action you're  using,
                 you'll get an error.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to tag on creation.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags to apply to the resource.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a
                        maximum of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin  with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag values are case-sensitive and accept
                        a maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To allocate an Elastic IP address from Amazon's address pool
