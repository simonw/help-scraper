GET-IPAM-ADDRESS-HISTORY()                          GET-IPAM-ADDRESS-HISTORY()



NAME
       get-ipam-address-history -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve  historical information about a CIDR within an IPAM scope. For
       more information, see View the history of IP addresses  in  the  Amazon
       VPC IPAM User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-ipam-address-history  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: HistoryRecords

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without  actually making the request and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cidr (string)
          The CIDR you want the history of. The CIDR can be an IPv4 or IPv6 IP
          address range. If you enter a /16 IPv4 CIDR, you  will  get  records
          that  match  it  exactly.  You  will not get records for any subnets
          within the /16 CIDR.

       --ipam-scope-id (string)
          The ID of the IPAM scope that the CIDR is in.

       --vpc-id (string)
          The ID of the VPC you want your history records filtered by.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start of the time period for which you are looking for  history.
          If you omit this option, it will default to the value of EndTime.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end of the time period for which you are looking for history. If
          you omit this option, it will default to the current time.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get the history of a CIDR

       The following get-ipam-address-history example gets the  history  of  a
       CIDR.

       (Linux):

          aws ec2 get-ipam-address-history \
             --cidr 10.0.0.0/16 \
             --ipam-scope-id ipam-scope-02fc38cd4c48e7d38 \
             --start-time 2021-12-08T01:00:00.000Z \
             --end-time 2021-12-10T01:00:00.000Z

       (Windows):

          aws ec2 get-ipam-address-history ^
             --cidr 10.0.0.0/16 ^
             --ipam-scope-id ipam-scope-02fc38cd4c48e7d38 ^
             --start-time 2021-12-08T01:00:00.000Z ^

OUTPUT
       HistoryRecords -> (list)
          A historical record for a CIDR within an IPAM scope. If the CIDR  is
          associated  with  an EC2 instance, you will see an object in the re-
          sponse for the instance and one for the network interface.

          (structure)
              The historical record of a CIDR within an IPAM scope.  For  more
              information,  see View the history of IP addresses in the Amazon
              VPC IPAM User Guide .

              ResourceOwnerId -> (string)
                 The ID of the resource owner.

              ResourceRegion -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Region of the resource.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of the resource.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the resource.

              ResourceCidr -> (string)
                 The CIDR of the resource.

              ResourceName -> (string)
                 The name of the resource.

              ResourceComplianceStatus -> (string)
                 The compliance status of a resource. For more information  on
                 compliance  statuses,  see  Monitor CIDR usage by resource in
                 the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide .

              ResourceOverlapStatus -> (string)
                 The overlap status of an IPAM resource.  The  overlap  status
                 tells  you  if  the CIDR for a resource overlaps with another
                 CIDR in the scope. For more information on overlap  statuses,
                 see  Monitor  CIDR  usage  by resource in the Amazon VPC IPAM
                 User Guide .

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The VPC ID of the resource.

              SampledStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 Sampled start time of the resource-to-CIDR association within
                 the  IPAM scope. Changes are picked up in periodic snapshots,
                 so the start time may  have  occurred  before  this  specific
                 time.

              SampledEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 Sampled  end  time of the resource-to-CIDR association within
                 the IPAM scope. Changes are picked up in periodic  snapshots,
                 so the end time may have occurred before this specific time.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.
