NAME
       modify-instance-credit-specification -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  the  credit  option  for  CPU  usage  on a running or stopped
       burstable performance instance. The credit options are standard and un-
       limited .

       For more information, see Burstable performance instances in the Amazon
       EC2 User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-instance-credit-specification
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--client-token <value>]
          --instance-credit-specifications <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive  token that you provide to ensure idempo-
          tency of  your  modification  request.  For  more  information,  see
          Ensuring Idempotency .

       --instance-credit-specifications (list)
          Information about the credit option for CPU usage.

          (structure)
              Describes the credit option for CPU usage of a burstable perfor-
              mance instance.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the instance.

              CpuCredits -> (string)
                 The credit option for CPU usage of the instance. Valid values
                 are standard and unlimited .

                 T3  instances  with host tenancy do not support the unlimited
                 CPU credit option.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          InstanceId=string,CpuCredits=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "InstanceId": "string",
              "CpuCredits": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To modify the credit option for CPU usage of an instance

       This example modifies the credit option for CPU usage of the  specified
       instance  in  the specified region to "unlimited". Valid credit options
       are "standard" and "unlimited".

       Command:

          aws ec2 modify-instance-credit-specification --instance-credit-specification "InstanceId=i-1234567890abcdef0,CpuCredits=unlimited"

       Output:

          {
            "SuccessfulInstanceCreditSpecifications": [
              {
                "InstanceId": "i-1234567890abcdef0"
              }
            ],
            "UnsuccessfulInstanceCreditSpecifications": []
          }

OUTPUT
       SuccessfulInstanceCreditSpecifications -> (list)
          Information about the instances whose credit option  for  CPU  usage
          was successfully modified.

          (structure)
              Describes the burstable performance instance whose credit option
              for CPU usage was successfully modified.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the instance.

       UnsuccessfulInstanceCreditSpecifications -> (list)
          Information about the instances whose credit option  for  CPU  usage
          was not modified.

          (structure)
              Describes the burstable performance instance whose credit option
              for CPU usage was not modified.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the instance.

              Error -> (structure)
                 The applicable error for the burstable  performance  instance
                 whose credit option for CPU usage was not modified.

                 Code -> (string)
                     The error code.

                 Message -> (string)
                     The applicable error message.
