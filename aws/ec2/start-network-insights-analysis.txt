OPTIONS
       --network-insights-path-id (string)
          The ID of the path.

       --filter-in-arns (list)
          The Amazon Resource Names (ARN) of the resources that the path  must
          traverse.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --tag-specifications (list)
          The tags to apply.

          (structure)
              The tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being  cre-
              ated.

              NOTE:
                 The  Valid  Values  lists  all the resource types that can be
                 tagged. However, the action you're using  might  not  support
                 tagging  all of these resource types. If you try to tag a re-
                 source type that is unsupported for the action you're  using,
                 you'll get an error.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to tag on creation.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags to apply to the resource.

                 (structure)

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a
                        maximum of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin  with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag values are case-sensitive and accept
                        a maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResourceType=string,Tags=[{Key=string,Value=string},{Key=string,Value=string}] ...

       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency  of the request. For more information, see How to ensure
          idempotency .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To analyze a path

       The following start-network-insights-analysis example analyzes the path
       between  the  source  and  destination. To view the results of the path
       analysis, use the describe-network-insights-analyses command.

          aws ec2 start-network-insights-analysis \
              --network-insights-path-id nip-0b26f224f1d131fa8

       Output:

          {
