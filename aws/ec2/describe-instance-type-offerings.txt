NAME
       describe-instance-type-offerings -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of all instance types offered. The results can be fil-
       tered by location (Region or Availability  Zone).  If  no  location  is
       specified,  the  instance  types  offered in the current Region are re-
       turned.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-instance-type-offerings is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: InstanceTypeOfferings

SYNOPSIS
            describe-instance-type-offerings
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--location-type <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --location-type (string)
          The location type.

          Possible values:

          o region

          o availability-zone

          o availability-zone-id

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters. Filter names and values are case-sensitive.

          o location - This depends on the location type. For example, if  the
            location type is region (default), the location is the Region code
            (for example, us-east-2 .)

          o instance-type - The instance type. For example, c5.2xlarge .

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To list the instance types offered in a Region

       The following describe-instance-type-offerings example  lists  the  in-
       stance types offered in the Region configured as the default Region for
       the AWS CLI.

          aws ec2 describe-instance-type-offerings

       To list the instance types offered in a different Region,  specify  the
       Region using the --region parameter.

          aws ec2 describe-instance-type-offerings \
              --region us-east-2

       Output:

          {
            "InstanceTypeOfferings": [
                {
                    "InstanceType": "m5.2xlarge",
                    "LocationType": "region",
                    "Location": "us-east-2"
                },
                {
                    "InstanceType": "t3.micro",
                    "LocationType": "region",
                    "Location": "us-east-2"
                },
                ...
            ]
          }

       Example 2: To list the instance types offered in an Availability Zone

       The  following  describe-instance-type-offerings  example lists the in-
       stance types offered in the specified Availability Zone. The Availabil-
       ity Zone must be in the specified Region.

          aws ec2 describe-instance-type-offerings \
              --location-type availability-zone \
              --filters Name=location,Values=us-east-2a \
              --region us-east-2

       Example 3: To check whether an instance type is supported

       The   following   describe-instance-type-offerings   command  indicates
       whether the c5.xlarge instance type is supported in the  specified  Re-
       gion.

          aws ec2 describe-instance-type-offerings \
              --filters Name=instance-type,Values=c5.xlarge \
              --region us-east-2

       The following describe-instance-type-offerings example lists all C5 in-
       stance types that are supported in the specified Region.

          aws ec2 describe-instance-type-offerings \
              --filters Name=instance-type,Values=c5* \
              --query "InstanceTypeOfferings[].InstanceType" \
              --region us-east-2

       Output:

          [
              "c5d.12xlarge",
              "c5d.9xlarge",
              "c5n.xlarge",
              "c5.xlarge",
              "c5d.metal",
              "c5n.metal",
              "c5.large",
              "c5d.2xlarge",
              "c5n.4xlarge",
              "c5.2xlarge",
              "c5n.large",
              "c5n.9xlarge",
              "c5d.large",
              "c5.18xlarge",
              "c5d.18xlarge",
              "c5.12xlarge",
              "c5n.18xlarge",
              "c5.metal",
              "c5d.4xlarge",
              "c5.24xlarge",
              "c5d.xlarge",
              "c5n.2xlarge",
              "c5d.24xlarge",
              "c5.9xlarge",
              "c5.4xlarge"
          ]
