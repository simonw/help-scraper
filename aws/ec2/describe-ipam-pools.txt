DESCRIBE-IPAM-POOLS()                                    DESCRIBE-IPAM-POOLS()



NAME
       describe-ipam-pools -

DESCRIPTION
       Get information about your IPAM pools.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-ipam-pools is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: IpamPools

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without  actually making the request and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters for the request. For more information about fil-
          tering, see Filtering CLI output .

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --ipam-pool-ids (list)
          The IDs of the IPAM pools you would like information on.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To view the details for an IPAM pool

       The following describe-ipam-pools example shows the details for pools.

       (Linux):

          aws ec2 describe-ipam-pools \
              --filters Name=owner-id,Values=123456789012 Name=ipam-scope-id,Values=ipam-scope-02fc38cd4c48e7d38

          }

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.

       IpamPools -> (list)
          Information about the IPAM pools.

          (structure)
              In IPAM, a pool is  a  collection  of  contiguous  IP  addresses
              CIDRs.  Pools enable you to organize your IP addresses according
              to your routing and security needs. For  example,  if  you  have
              separate  routing and security needs for development and produc-
              tion applications, you can create a pool for each.

              OwnerId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account ID of the owner of  the  IPAM
                 pool.

              IpamPoolId -> (string)
                 The ID of the IPAM pool.

              SourceIpamPoolId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of  the source IPAM pool. You can use this option to
                 create an IPAM pool within an existing source pool.

              IpamPoolArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IPAM pool.

              IpamScopeArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the scope of the IPAM pool.

              IpamScopeType -> (string)
                 In IPAM, a scope is the highest-level container within  IPAM.
                 An  IPAM  contains  two default scopes. Each scope represents
                 the IP space for a single network. The private scope  is  in-
                 tended  for all private IP address space. The public scope is
                 intended for all public IP address space. Scopes  enable  you
                 to  reuse  IP  addresses across multiple unconnected networks
                 without causing IP address overlap or conflict.

              IpamArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the IPAM.

              IpamRegion -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Region of the IPAM pool.

              Locale -> (string)
                 The locale of the IPAM pool. In IPAM, the locale is the  Ama-
                 zon Web Services Region or, for IPAM IPv4 pools in the public
                 scope, the network border group for an  Amazon  Web  Services
                 Local  Zone where you want to make an IPAM pool available for
                 allocations (supported Local Zones ). If you choose an Amazon
                 Web  Services  Region for locale that has not been configured
                 as an operating Region for the IPAM, you'll get an error.

              PoolDepth -> (integer)
                 The depth of pools in your IPAM pool. The pool depth quota is
                 10.  For  more  information, see Quotas in IPAM in the Amazon
                 VPC IPAM User Guide .

              State -> (string)
                 The state of the IPAM pool.

              StateMessage -> (string)
                 The state message.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the IPAM pool.

              AutoImport -> (boolean)
                 If selected, IPAM will continuously look for resources within
                 the  CIDR range of this pool and automatically import them as
                 allocations into your IPAM. The CIDRs that will be  allocated
                 for  these  resources  must not already be allocated to other
                 resources in order for the import to succeed. IPAM  will  im-
                 port  a CIDR regardless of its compliance with the pool's al-
                 location rules, so a resource might be  imported  and  subse-
                 quently  marked  as  noncompliant. If IPAM discovers multiple
                 CIDRs that overlap, IPAM will import the largest  CIDR  only.
                 If  IPAM  discovers  multiple CIDRs with matching CIDRs, IPAM
                 will randomly import one of them only.

                 A locale must be set on the pool for this feature to work.

              PubliclyAdvertisable -> (boolean)
                 Determines if a pool is publicly advertisable. This option is
                 not available for pools with AddressFamily set to ipv4 .

              AddressFamily -> (string)
                 The address family of the pool.

              AllocationMinNetmaskLength -> (integer)
                 The  minimum  netmask length required for CIDR allocations in
                 this IPAM pool to be compliant. The  minimum  netmask  length
                 must  be  less than the maximum netmask length. Possible net-
                 mask lengths for IPv4 addresses are 0 - 32. Possible  netmask
                 lengths for IPv6 addresses are 0 - 128.

              AllocationMaxNetmaskLength -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  netmask length possible for CIDR allocations in
                 this IPAM pool to be compliant. The  maximum  netmask  length
                 must  be  greater  than  the minimum netmask length. Possible
                 netmask lengths for IPv4 addresses are 0 - 32. Possible  net-
                 mask lengths for IPv6 addresses are 0 - 128.

              AllocationDefaultNetmaskLength -> (integer)
                 The  default  netmask  length  for  allocations added to this
                 pool. If, for example, the CIDR  assigned  to  this  pool  is
                 10.0.0.0/8  and  you  enter 16 here, new allocations will de-
                 fault to 10.0.0.0/16.

              AllocationResourceTags -> (list)
                 Tags that are required for resources that use CIDRs from this
                 IPAM  pool. Resources that do not have these tags will not be
                 allowed to allocate space from the  pool.  If  the  resources
                 have their tags changed after they have allocated space or if
                 the allocation tagging requirements are changed on the  pool,
                 the resource may be marked as noncompliant.

                 (structure)
                     The  key/value  combination  of a tag assigned to the re-
                     source. Use the tag key in the filter name  and  the  tag
                     value  as  the filter value. For example, to find all re-
                     sources that have a tag with the key Owner and the  value
                     TeamA  ,  specify tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA
                     for the filter value.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of a tag assigned to the  resource.  Use  this
                        filter  to  find  all  resources assigned a tag with a
                        specific key, regardless of the tag value.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the  resource.
                 Use  the  tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the
                 filter value. For example, to find all resources that have  a
                 tag  with  the  key  Owner  and  the  value  TeamA  , specify
                 tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept  a
                        maximum  of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and  accept
                        a maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

              AwsService -> (string)
