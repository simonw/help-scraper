NAME
       describe-reserved-instances-modifications -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the modifications made to your Reserved Instances. If no pa-
       rameter is specified, information about  all  your  Reserved  Instances
       modification  requests  is returned. If a modification ID is specified,
       only information about the specific modification is returned.

       For more information, see Modifying Reserved Instances  in  the  Amazon
       EC2 User Guide .

       NOTE:
          We  are  retiring  EC2-Classic on August 15, 2022. We recommend that
          you migrate from EC2-Classic to a VPC.  For  more  information,  see
          Migrate  from  EC2-Classic  to  a  VPC in the Amazon Elastic Compute
          Cloud User Guide .

       describe-reserved-instances-modifications  is  a  paginated  operation.
       Multiple  API  calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data
       set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the  --no-pagi-
       nate  argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a
       paginated response, the --query argument must extract data from the re-
       sults  of  the  following query expressions: ReservedInstancesModifica-
       tions

SYNOPSIS
            describe-reserved-instances-modifications
          [--filters <value>]
          [--reserved-instances-modification-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]

            served Instances created as part of the modification request. This
            ID is only available when the status of the modification  is  ful-

          o status-message - The reason for the status.

          o update-date  - The time when the modification request was last up-
            dated.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --reserved-instances-modification-ids (list)
          IDs for the submitted modification request.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
