NAME
       delete-transit-gateway-multicast-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the specified transit gateway multicast domain.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-transit-gateway-multicast-domain
          --transit-gateway-multicast-domain-id <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --transit-gateway-multicast-domain-id (string)
          The ID of the transit gateway multicast domain.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a transit gateway multicast domain

       The  following  delete-transit-gateway-multicast-domain example deletes
       the specified multicast domain.

          aws ec2 delete-transit-gateway-multicast-domain \
              --transit-gateway-multicast-domain-id tgw-mcast-domain-0c4905cef7EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "TransitGatewayMulticastDomain": {
                  "TransitGatewayMulticastDomainId": "tgw-mcast-domain-02bb79002bEXAMPLE",
                  "TransitGatewayId": "tgw-0d88d2d0d5EXAMPLE",
                  "State": "deleting",
                  "CreationTime": "2019-11-20T22:02:03.000Z"
              }
          }
