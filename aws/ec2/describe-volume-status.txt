DESCRIBE-VOLUME-STATUS()                              DESCRIBE-VOLUME-STATUS()



NAME
       describe-volume-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  status of the specified volumes. Volume status provides
       the result of the checks performed on your volumes to determine  events
       that  can  impair the performance of your volumes. The performance of a
       volume can be affected if an issue occurs on  the  volume's  underlying
       host.  If  the  volume's  underlying host experiences a power outage or
       system issue, after the system is restored, there could be data  incon-
       sistencies on the volume. Volume events notify you if this occurs. Vol-
       ume actions notify you if any action needs to be taken in  response  to
       the event.

       The  DescribeVolumeStatus  operation provides the following information
       about the specified volumes:
          Status : Reflects the current status of  the  volume.  The  possible
          values  are  ok , impaired , warning , or insufficient-data . If all
          checks pass, the overall status of the volume is ok . If  the  check
          fails,  the  overall  status is impaired . If the status is insuffi-
          cient-data , then the checks might still be  taking  place  on  your
          volume  at  the  time.  We recommend that you retry the request. For
          more information about volume status, see Monitor the status of your
          volumes in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

          Events  : Reflect the cause of a volume status and might require you
          to take action. For example, if your volume returns an impaired sta-
          tus,  then  the volume event might be potential-data-inconsistency .
          This means that your volume has been affected by an issue  with  the
          underlying host, has all I/O operations disabled, and might have in-
          consistent data.

          Actions : Reflect the actions you might have to take in response  to
          an  event.  For example, if the status of the volume is impaired and
          the volume event shows potential-data-inconsistency , then  the  ac-
          tion shows enable-volume-io . This means that you may want to enable
          the I/O operations for the volume by calling the  EnableVolumeIO ac-
          tion and then check the volume for data consistency.

       Volume  status  is  based on the volume status checks, and does not re-
       flect the volume state. Therefore, volume status does not indicate vol-
       umes in the error state (for example, when a volume is incapable of ac-
       cepting I/O.)

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-volume-status is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: VolumeStatuses

          o event.event-id - The event ID.

          o event.event-type - The event  type  (for  io-enabled  :  passed  |
            failed ; for io-performance : io-performance:degraded | io-perfor-
            mance:severely-degraded | io-performance:stalled ).

          o event.not-after - The latest end time for the event.

          o volume-status.status  -  The status of the volume (ok | impaired |
            warning | insufficient-data ).

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --volume-ids (list)
          The IDs of the volumes.

          Default: Describes all your volumes.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe the status of impaired volumes

       This  example command describes the status for all volumes that are im-
       paired. In this example output, there are no impaired volumes.

       Command:

          aws ec2 describe-volume-status --filters Name=volume-status.status,Values=impaired

       Output:

          {
              "VolumeStatuses": []
          }

       If you have a volume with a failed status check (status  is  impaired),
       see Working with an Impaired Volume in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.
