NAME
       disable-vpc-classic-link-dns-support -

DESCRIPTION
       Disables  ClassicLink DNS support for a VPC. If disabled, DNS hostnames
       resolve  to  public  IP  addresses  when  addressed  between  a  linked
       EC2-Classic instance and instances in the VPC to which it's linked. For
       more information, see ClassicLink in the Amazon Elastic  Compute  Cloud
       User Guide .

       You must specify a VPC ID in the request.

       NOTE:
          We  are  retiring  EC2-Classic on August 15, 2022. We recommend that
          you migrate from EC2-Classic to a VPC.  For  more  information,  see
          Migrate  from  EC2-Classic  to  a  VPC in the Amazon Elastic Compute
          Cloud User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disable-vpc-classic-link-dns-support
          [--vpc-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --vpc-id (string)
          The ID of the VPC.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Command:

          aws ec2 disable-vpc-classic-link-dns-support --vpc-id vpc-88888888

            "Return": true
          }
