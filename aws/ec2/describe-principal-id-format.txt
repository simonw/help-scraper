DESCRIBE-PRINCIPAL-ID-FORMAT()                  DESCRIBE-PRINCIPAL-ID-FORMAT()



NAME
       describe-principal-id-format -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  ID  format settings for the root user and all IAM roles
       and IAM users that have explicitly specified a longer ID  (17-character
       ID) preference.

       By default, all IAM roles and IAM users default to the same ID settings
       as the root user, unless they explicitly override  the  settings.  This
       request  is  useful  for identifying those IAM users and IAM roles that
       have overridden the default ID settings.

       The following resource types  support  longer  IDs:  bundle  |  conver-
       sion-task  |  customer-gateway | dhcp-options | elastic-ip-allocation |
       elastic-ip-association | export-task | flow-log | image | import-task |
       instance  |  internet-gateway | network-acl | network-acl-association |
       network-interface | network-interface-attachment | prefix-list | reser-
       vation | route-table | route-table-association | security-group | snap-
       shot  |  subnet  |  subnet-cidr-block-association  |  volume  |  vpc  |
       vpc-cidr-block-association  |  vpc-endpoint  | vpc-peering-connection |
       vpn-connection | vpn-gateway .

       describe-principal-id-format is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: Principals

SYNOPSIS
            describe-principal-id-format
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--resources <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --resources (list)
          The type of resource: bundle | conversion-task | customer-gateway  |
          dhcp-options  | elastic-ip-allocation | elastic-ip-association | ex-
          port-task | flow-log | image  |  import-task  |  instance  |  inter-
          net-gateway | network-acl | network-acl-association | network-inter-
          face | network-interface-attachment | prefix-list  |  reservation  |
          route-table  | route-table-association | security-group | snapshot |
          subnet  |   subnet-cidr-block-association   |   volume   |   vpc   |
          vpc-cidr-block-association | vpc-endpoint | vpc-peering-connection |
          vpn-connection | vpn-gateway

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To  describe  the ID format for IAM users and roles with long ID format
       enabled

       The following describe-principal-id-format  example  describes  the  ID
       format for the root user, all IAM roles, and all IAM users with long ID
       format enabled.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.
