REGISTER-TRANSIT-GATEWAY-MULREGISTER-TRANSIT-GATEWAY-MULTICAST-GROUP-SOURCES()



NAME
       register-transit-gateway-multicast-group-sources -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers sources (network interfaces) with the specified transit gate-
       way multicast group.

       A multicast source is a network interface attached to a  supported  in-
       stance  that  sends  multicast traffic. For information about supported
       instances, see Multicast Considerations in Amazon VPC Transit  Gateways
       .

       After  you  add  the source, use SearchTransitGatewayMulticastGroups to
       verify that the source was added to the multicast group.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            register-transit-gateway-multicast-group-sources
          [--transit-gateway-multicast-domain-id <value>]
          [--group-ip-address <value>]
          [--network-interface-ids <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --transit-gateway-multicast-domain-id (string)
          The ID of the transit gateway multicast domain.

       --group-ip-address (string)
          The IP address assigned to the transit gateway multicast group.

       --network-interface-ids (list)
          The group sources' network interface IDs to register with the  tran-
          sit gateway multicast group.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To register a source with a transit gateway multicast group.

       The  following register-transit-gateway-multicast-group-sources example
       registers the specified network interface group source with a multicast
       group.

          aws ec2 register-transit-gateway-multicast-group-sources \
              --transit-gateway-multicast-domain-id tgw-mcast-domain-0c4905cef79d6e597 \
              --group-ip-address 224.0.1.0 \
              --network-interface-ids eni-07f290fc3c090cbae

       Output:

          {
              "RegisteredMulticastGroupSources": {
                  "TransitGatewayMulticastDomainId": "tgw-mcast-domain-0c4905cef79d6e597",
                  "RegisteredNetworkInterfaceIds": [
                      "eni-07f290fc3c090cbae"
                  ],
                  "GroupIpAddress": "224.0.1.0"
              }
          }

       Gateways Guide.

OUTPUT
       RegisteredMulticastGroupSources -> (structure)
          Information about the transit gateway multicast group sources.

          TransitGatewayMulticastDomainId -> (string)
              The ID of the transit gateway multicast domain.

          RegisteredNetworkInterfaceIds -> (list)
              The IDs of the network interfaces members  registered  with  the
              transit gateway multicast group.

              (string)

          GroupIpAddress -> (string)
              The IP address assigned to the transit gateway multicast group.
