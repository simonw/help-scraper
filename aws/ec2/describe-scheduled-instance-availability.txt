NAME
       describe-scheduled-instance-availability -

DESCRIPTION
       Finds available schedules that meet the specified criteria.

       You  can  search for an available schedule no more than 3 months in ad-
       vance. You must meet the minimum required duration of 1,200  hours  per
       year.  For  example, the minimum daily schedule is 4 hours, the minimum
       weekly schedule is 24 hours, and the minimum monthly  schedule  is  100
       hours.

       After  you  find a schedule that meets your needs, call  PurchaseSched-
       uledInstances to purchase Scheduled Instances with that schedule.

       NOTE:
          We are retiring EC2-Classic on August 15, 2022.  We  recommend  that
          you  migrate  from  EC2-Classic  to a VPC. For more information, see
          Migrate from EC2-Classic to a VPC  in  the  Amazon  Elastic  Compute
          Cloud User Guide .

       describe-scheduled-instance-availability is a paginated operation. Mul-
       tiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data  set
       of  results.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: ScheduledInstanceAvailabilitySet

SYNOPSIS
            describe-scheduled-instance-availability
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--filters <value>]
          --first-slot-start-time-range <value>
          [--max-slot-duration-in-hours <value>]
          [--min-slot-duration-in-hours <value>]
          --recurrence <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --filters (list)
          The filters.

          o availability-zone - The Availability Zone (for example, us-west-2a
            ).

          o instance-type - The instance type (for example, c4.large ).

          o network-platform - The network platform (EC2-Classic or EC2-VPC ).

          o platform - The platform (Linux/UNIX or Windows ).

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --first-slot-start-time-range (structure)
          The time period for the first schedule to start.

          EarliestTime -> (timestamp)
              The earliest date and time, in UTC, for the  Scheduled  Instance
              to start.

          LatestTime -> (timestamp)
              The  latest date and time, in UTC, for the Scheduled Instance to
              start. This value must be later than or equal  to  the  earliest
              date and at most three months in the future.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EarliestTime=timestamp,LatestTime=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "EarliestTime": timestamp,
            "LatestTime": timestamp
          }

       --max-slot-duration-in-hours (integer)
          The maximum available duration, in hours. This value must be greater
          than MinSlotDurationInHours and less than 1,720.

       --min-slot-duration-in-hours (integer)
          The minimum available duration, in hours. The minimum required dura-
          tion  is 1,200 hours per year. For example, the minimum daily sched-
          ule is 4 hours, the minimum weekly schedule is  24  hours,  and  the
          minimum monthly schedule is 100 hours.

       --recurrence (structure)
          The schedule recurrence.

          Frequency -> (string)
              The frequency (Daily , Weekly , or Monthly ).

          Interval -> (integer)
              The interval quantity. The interval unit depends on the value of
              Frequency . For example, every 2 weeks or every 2 months.

          OccurrenceDays -> (list)
              The days. For a monthly schedule, this is one or  more  days  of
              the  month  (1-31).  For  a weekly schedule, this is one or more
              days of the week (1-7, where 1 is  Sunday).  You  can't  specify
              this  value with a daily schedule. If the occurrence is relative
              to the end of the month, you can specify only a single day.

              (integer)

          OccurrenceRelativeToEnd -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether the occurrence is relative to the end  of  the
              specified  week  or  month.  You can't specify this value with a
              daily schedule.

          OccurrenceUnit -> (string)
              The unit for OccurrenceDays (DayOfWeek  or  DayOfMonth  ).  This
              value is required for a monthly schedule. You can't specify Day-
              OfWeek with a weekly schedule. You can't specify this value with
              a daily schedule.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Frequency=string,Interval=integer,OccurrenceDays=integer,integer,OccurrenceRelativeToEnd=boolean,OccurrenceUnit=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Frequency": "string",
            "Interval": integer,
            "OccurrenceDays": [integer, ...],
            "OccurrenceRelativeToEnd": true|false,
            "OccurrenceUnit": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
