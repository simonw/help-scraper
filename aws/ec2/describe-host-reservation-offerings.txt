NAME

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  Dedicated  Host reservations that are available to pur-
       chase.

       The results describe all of the Dedicated Host  reservation  offerings,
       including offerings that might not match the instance family and Region
       of your Dedicated Hosts. When purchasing an offering, ensure  that  the
       instance  family  and  Region of the offering matches that of the Dedi-
       cated Hosts with which it is to be  associated.  For  more  information
       about  supported  instance types, see Dedicated Hosts in the Amazon EC2
       User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-host-reservation-offerings is a paginated operation.  Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: OfferingSet

SYNOPSIS
            describe-host-reservation-offerings
          [--filter <value>]
          [--max-duration <value>]
          [--min-duration <value>]
          [--offering-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filter (list)
          The filters.

          o instance-family  -  The instance family of the offering (for exam-
            ple, m4 ).

          o payment-option - The payment option (NoUpfront | PartialUpfront  |
            AllUpfront ).

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-duration (integer)
          This  is the maximum duration of the reservation to purchase, speci-
          fied  in  seconds.  Reservations  are  available  in  one-year   and
          three-year terms. The number of seconds specified must be the number
          of seconds in a year (365x24x60x60) times one of the supported dura-
          tions (1 or 3). For example, specify 94608000 for three years.

       --min-duration (integer)
          This  is  the minimum duration of the reservation you'd like to pur-
          chase, specified in seconds. Reservations are available in  one-year
          and  three-year  terms.  The number of seconds specified must be the
          number of seconds in a year (365x24x60x60) times  one  of  the  sup-
          ported  durations  (1  or  3). For example, specify 31536000 for one
          year.

       --offering-id (string)
          The ID of the reservation offering.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
