DESCRIBE-ADDRESSES-ATTRIBUTE()                  DESCRIBE-ADDRESSES-ATTRIBUTE()



NAME
       describe-addresses-attribute -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the attributes of the specified Elastic IP addresses. For re-
       quirements, see Using reverse DNS for email applications .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-addresses-attribute is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: Addresses

SYNOPSIS
            describe-addresses-attribute
          [--allocation-ids <value>]
          [--attribute <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --allocation-ids (list)
          [EC2-VPC] The allocation IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --attribute (string)
          The attribute of the IP address.

          Possible values:

          o domain-name

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view the attributes of the domain name associated with an elastic IP
       address

       The  following  describe-addresses-attribute  examples  return  the at-
       tributes of the domain name associated with the elastic IP address.

       Linux:

          aws ec2 describe-addresses-attribute \
              --allocation-ids eipalloc-abcdef01234567890 \
              --attribute domain-name

       Windows:

          aws ec2 describe-addresses-attribute ^
              --allocation-ids eipalloc-abcdef01234567890 ^
              --attribute domain-name

       Output:

          {
              "Addresses": [
                  {
                      "PublicIp": "192.0.2.0",
                      "AllocationId": "eipalloc-abcdef01234567890",
                      "PtrRecord": "example.com."
                  }
              ]
          }

       To view the attributes of an elastic IP address, you  must  have  first
       associated a domain name with the elastic IP address. For more informa-
       tion, see Use reverse DNS for email applications in the Amazon EC2 User
       Guide or modify-address-attribute in the AWS CLI Command Reference.

       Addresses -> (list)
          Information about the IP addresses.

          (structure)
              The attributes associated with an Elastic IP address.

              PublicIp -> (string)
                 The public IP address.

              AllocationId -> (string)
                 [EC2-VPC] The allocation ID.

              PtrRecord -> (string)
                 The pointer (PTR) record for the IP address.

              PtrRecordUpdate -> (structure)
                 The updated PTR record for the IP address.
