DESCRIPTION
       Purchases  a Reserved Instance for use with your account. With Reserved
       Instances, you pay a lower hourly rate compared to  On-Demand  instance
       pricing.

       Use   DescribeReservedInstancesOfferings  to get a list of Reserved In-
       stance offerings that match your specifications. After you've purchased
       a  Reserved Instance, you can check for your new Reserved Instance with
       DescribeReservedInstances .

       To queue a purchase for a future date  and  time,  specify  a  purchase
       time. If you do not specify a purchase time, the default is the current
       time.

       For more information, see Reserved Instances and Reserved Instance Mar-

          --reserved-instances-offering-id <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--limit-price <value>]
          [--purchase-time <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-count (integer)
          The number of Reserved Instances to purchase.

       --reserved-instances-offering-id (string)
          The ID of the Reserved Instance offering to purchase.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --limit-price (structure)
          Specified for Reserved Instance Marketplace offerings to  limit  the
          total order and ensure that the Reserved Instances are not purchased
          at unexpected prices.

          Amount -> (double)
              Used for Reserved Instance Marketplace offerings. Specifies  the
              limit price on the total order (instanceCount * price).

          CurrencyCode -> (string)
              The  currency  in  which  the limitPrice amount is specified. At
              this time, the only supported currency is USD .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Amount=double,CurrencyCode=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Amount": double,
            "CurrencyCode": "USD"
          }

       --purchase-time (timestamp)
          The time at which to purchase the Reserved Instance, in  UTC  format
          (for example, YYYY -MM -DD T*HH* :MM :SS Z).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
