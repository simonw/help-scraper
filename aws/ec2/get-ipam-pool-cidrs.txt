GET-IPAM-POOL-CIDRS()                                    GET-IPAM-POOL-CIDRS()



NAME
       get-ipam-pool-cidrs -

DESCRIPTION
       Get the CIDRs provisioned to an IPAM pool.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-ipam-pool-cidrs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: IpamPoolCidrs

SYNOPSIS
            get-ipam-pool-cidrs
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --ipam-pool-id <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without  actually making the request and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --ipam-pool-id (string)
          The ID of the IPAM pool you want the CIDR for.

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters for the request. For more information about fil-
          tering, see Filtering CLI output .

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get the CIDRs provisioned to an IPAM pool

       The following get-ipam-pool-cidrs example gets the CIDRs provisioned to
       an IPAM pool.

       (Linux):

          aws ec2 get-ipam-pool-cidrs \
              --ipam-pool-id ipam-pool-0533048da7d823723 \
              --filters 'Name=cidr,Values=10.*'

       (Windows):

          aws ec2 get-ipam-pool-cidrs ^
              --ipam-pool-id ipam-pool-0533048da7d823723 ^
              --filters Name=cidr,Values=10.*

       Output:

          {
              "IpamPoolCidr": {
                  "Cidr": "10.0.0.0/24",
                  "State": "provisioned"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       IpamPoolCidrs -> (list)
          Information about the CIDRs provisioned to an IPAM pool.

          (structure)
              A CIDR provisioned to an IPAM pool.

              Cidr -> (string)
                 The CIDR provisioned to the IPAM pool. A CIDR is a  represen-
                 tation  of  an IP address and its associated network mask (or
                 netmask) and refers to a range of IP addresses. An IPv4  CIDR
                 example   is   10.24.34.0/23   .  An  IPv6  CIDR  example  is
                 2001:DB8::/32 .

              State -> (string)
                 The state of the CIDR.

              FailureReason -> (structure)
                 Details related to why an IPAM pool CIDR failed to be  provi-
                 sioned.

                 Code -> (string)
                     An  error code related to why an IPAM pool CIDR failed to
                     be provisioned.

                 Message -> (string)
                     A message related to why an IPAM pool CIDR failed  to  be
                     provisioned.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.
