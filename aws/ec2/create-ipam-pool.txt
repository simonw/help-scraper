CREATE-IPAM-POOL()                                          CREATE-IPAM-POOL()



NAME
       create-ipam-pool -

DESCRIPTION
       Create  an IP address pool for Amazon VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM). In
       IPAM, a pool is a collection of contiguous IP  addresses  CIDRs.  Pools
       enable  you to organize your IP addresses according to your routing and
       security needs. For example, if you have separate routing and  security
       needs  for  development  and  production applications, you can create a
       pool for each.

       For more information, see Create a top-level pool  in  the  Amazon  VPC
       IPAM User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without actually making the request and provides an error  response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --ipam-scope-id (string)
          The ID of the scope in which you would like to create the IPAM pool.

       --locale (string)
          In IPAM, the locale is the Amazon Web Services Region where you want
          to  make  an  IPAM pool available for allocations. Only resources in
          the same Region as the locale of the pool can get IP address alloca-
          tions from the pool. You can only allocate a CIDR for a VPC, for ex-
          ample, from an IPAM pool that shares a locale with the VPCs  Region.
          Note that once you choose a Locale for a pool, you cannot modify it.
          If you do not choose a locale, resources in Regions others than  the
          IPAM's home region cannot use CIDRs from this pool.

          Possible values: Any Amazon Web Services Region, such as us-east-1.

       --source-ipam-pool-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the  source IPAM pool. Use this option to create a pool
          within an existing pool. Note that the CIDR you  provision  for  the
          pool  within  the source pool must be available in the source pool's
          CIDR range.

       --description (string)
          A description for the IPAM pool.

       --address-family (string)
          The IP protocol assigned to this IPAM pool. You must  choose  either
          IPv4 or IPv6 protocol for a pool.

          Possible values:

          o ipv4

          o ipv6

       --auto-import | --no-auto-import (boolean)
          If  selected,  IPAM  will continuously look for resources within the
          CIDR range of this pool and automatically import them as allocations
          into your IPAM. The CIDRs that will be allocated for these resources
          must not already be allocated to other resources in  order  for  the
          import to succeed. IPAM will import a CIDR regardless of its compli-
          ance with the pool's allocation rules, so a resource  might  be  im-
          ported  and  subsequently  marked as noncompliant. If IPAM discovers
          multiple CIDRs that overlap, IPAM will import the largest CIDR only.
          If IPAM discovers multiple CIDRs with matching CIDRs, IPAM will ran-
          domly import one of them only.

          A locale must be set on the pool for this feature to work.

       --publicly-advertisable | --no-publicly-advertisable (boolean)
          Determines if the pool is publicly advertisable. This option is  not
          available for pools with AddressFamily set to ipv4 .

       --allocation-min-netmask-length (integer)
          The  minimum  netmask  length  required for CIDR allocations in this
          IPAM pool to be compliant. The minimum netmask length must  be  less
          than  the  maximum netmask length. Possible netmask lengths for IPv4
          addresses are 0 - 32. Possible netmask lengths  for  IPv6  addresses
          are 0 - 128.

       --allocation-max-netmask-length (integer)
          The  maximum  netmask  length  possible for CIDR allocations in this
          IPAM pool to be  compliant.  The  maximum  netmask  length  must  be
          greater  than  the  minimum netmask length. Possible netmask lengths
          for IPv4 addresses are 0 - 32. Possible netmask lengths for IPv6 ad-
          dresses are 0 - 128.

       --allocation-default-netmask-length (integer)
          The  default  netmask length for allocations added to this pool. If,
          for example, the CIDR assigned to this pool is  10.0.0.0/8  and  you
          enter 16 here, new allocations will default to 10.0.0.0/16.

       --allocation-resource-tags (list)
          Tags  that  are required for resources that use CIDRs from this IPAM
          pool. Resources that do not have these tags will not be  allowed  to
          allocate  space  from  the  pool.  If  the resources have their tags
          changed after they have allocated space or if the allocation tagging
          requirements  are changed on the pool, the resource may be marked as
          noncompliant.

          (structure)
              A tag on an IPAM resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to
                 find  all  resources  assigned a tag with a specific key, re-
                 gardless of the tag value.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {

            }
            ...
          ]

       --tag-specifications (list)
          The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the
          tag  key  in  the filter name and the tag value as the filter value.
          For example, to find all resources that have  a  tag  with  the  key
          Owner  and  the  value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for the filter name
          and TeamA for the filter value.

          (structure)
              The tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being  cre-
              ated.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to tag on creation.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags to apply to the resource.

                 (structure)

                        Constraints:  Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a
                        maximum of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin  with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag values are case-sensitive and accept
                        a maximum of 255 Unicode characters.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResourceType=string,Tags=[{Key=string,Value=string},{Key=string,Value=string}] ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [

                  "Value": "string"
                }
                ...
              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request. For more information, see Ensuring Idem-
          potency .

       --aws-service (string)
          Limits which service in Amazon Web Services that  the  pool  can  be
          used  in.  "ec2", for example, allows users to use space for Elastic
          IP addresses and VPCs.

          Possible values:

          o ec2

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       IpamPool -> (structure)
          Information about the IPAM pool created.

          OwnerId -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services account ID of  the  owner  of  the  IPAM
              pool.

          IpamPoolId -> (string)
              The ID of the IPAM pool.

          SourceIpamPoolId -> (string)
              The  ID of the source IPAM pool. You can use this option to cre-
              ate an IPAM pool within an existing source pool.

          IpamPoolArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the IPAM pool.

          IpamScopeArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the scope of the IPAM pool.

          IpamScopeType -> (string)
              In IPAM, a scope is the highest-level container within IPAM.  An
              IPAM  contains  two default scopes. Each scope represents the IP
              space for a single network. The private scope  is  intended  for
              all  private  IP address space. The public scope is intended for
              all public IP address space. Scopes enable you to reuse  IP  ad-
              dresses  across multiple unconnected networks without causing IP
              address overlap or conflict.

          IpamArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the IPAM.

          IpamRegion -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services Region of the IPAM pool.

          Locale -> (string)
              The locale of the IPAM pool. In IPAM, the locale is  the  Amazon
              Web  Services  Region where you want to make an IPAM pool avail-
              able for allocations. Only resources in the same Region  as  the
              locale of the pool can get IP address allocations from the pool.
              You can only allocate a CIDR for a VPC,  for  example,  from  an
              IPAM  pool  that shares a locale with the VPCs Region. Note that
              once you choose a Locale for a pool, you cannot  modify  it.  If
              you choose an Amazon Web Services Region for locale that has not
              been configured as an operating Region for the IPAM, you'll  get
              an error.

          PoolDepth -> (integer)
              The  depth  of  pools in your IPAM pool. The pool depth quota is
              10. For more information, see Quotas in IPAM in the  Amazon  VPC
              IPAM User Guide .

          State -> (string)
              The state of the IPAM pool.

          StateMessage -> (string)
              A message related to the failed creation of an IPAM pool.

          Description -> (string)
              The description of the IPAM pool.

          AutoImport -> (boolean)
              If  selected,  IPAM  will continuously look for resources within
              the CIDR range of this pool and automatically import them as al-
              locations  into  your IPAM. The CIDRs that will be allocated for
              these resources must not already be allocated to other resources
              in  order for the import to succeed. IPAM will import a CIDR re-
              gardless of its compliance with the pool's allocation rules,  so
              a  resource might be imported and subsequently marked as noncom-
              pliant. If IPAM discovers multiple CIDRs that overlap, IPAM will
              import  the  largest CIDR only. If IPAM discovers multiple CIDRs
              with matching CIDRs, IPAM will randomly import one of them only.

              A locale must be set on the pool for this feature to work.

          PubliclyAdvertisable -> (boolean)
              Determines if a pool is publicly advertisable.  This  option  is
              not available for pools with AddressFamily set to ipv4 .

          AddressFamily -> (string)
              The address family of the pool.

          AllocationMinNetmaskLength -> (integer)
              The minimum netmask length required for CIDR allocations in this
              IPAM pool to be compliant. The minimum netmask  length  must  be
              less  than  the maximum netmask length. Possible netmask lengths
              for IPv4 addresses are 0 - 32. Possible netmask lengths for IPv6
              addresses are 0 - 128.

          AllocationMaxNetmaskLength -> (integer)
              The maximum netmask length possible for CIDR allocations in this
              IPAM pool to be compliant. The maximum netmask  length  must  be
              greater  than  the  minimum  netmask  length.  Possible  netmask
              lengths for IPv4 addresses are 0 - 32. Possible netmask  lengths
              for IPv6 addresses are 0 - 128.

          AllocationDefaultNetmaskLength -> (integer)
              The  default  netmask length for allocations added to this pool.
              If, for example, the CIDR assigned to this  pool  is  10.0.0.0/8
              and   you  enter  16  here,  new  allocations  will  default  to
              10.0.0.0/16.

          AllocationResourceTags -> (list)
              Tags that are required for resources that use  CIDRs  from  this
              IPAM pool. Resources that do not have these tags will not be al-
              lowed to allocate space from the pool.  If  the  resources  have
              their tags changed after they have allocated space or if the al-
              location tagging requirements are changed on the pool,  the  re-
              source may be marked as noncompliant.

              (structure)
                 The  key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource.
                 Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value  as  the
                 filter  value. For example, to find all resources that have a
                 tag with  the  key  Owner  and  the  value  TeamA  ,  specify
                 tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this fil-
                     ter to find all resources assigned a tag with a  specific
                     key, regardless of the tag value.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of the tag.

          Tags -> (list)
              The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use
              the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as  the  filter
              value.  For  example, to find all resources that have a tag with
              the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify  tag:Owner  for  the
              filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

              (structure)
                 Describes a tag.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the tag.

                     Constraints:  Tag  keys  are  case-sensitive and accept a
                     maximum of 127 Unicode characters.  May  not  begin  with
                     aws: .

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of the tag.

                     Constraints:  Tag  values are case-sensitive and accept a
                     maximum of 255 Unicode characters.

          AwsService -> (string)
              Limits which service in Amazon Web Services that the pool can be
              used in. "ec2", for example, allows users to use space for Elas-
              tic IP addresses and VPCs.
