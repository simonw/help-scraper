NAME
       associate-instance-event-window -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  one  or more targets with an event window. Only one type of
       target (instance IDs, Dedicated Host IDs, or  tags)  can  be  specified
       with an event window.

       For  more information, see Define event windows for scheduled events in
       the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            associate-instance-event-window
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --instance-event-window-id <value>
          --association-target <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --instance-event-window-id (string)
          The ID of the event window.

       --association-target (structure)
          One or more targets associated with the specified event window.

          InstanceIds -> (list)
              The  IDs of the instances to associate with the event window. If
              the instance is on a Dedicated Host, you can't specify  the  In-
              stance  ID parameter; you must use the Dedicated Host ID parame-
              ter.

              (string)

          InstanceTags -> (list)
              The instance tags to associate with the event  window.  Any  in-
              stances  associated  with  the  tags will be associated with the
              event window.

              (structure)
                 Describes a tag.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the tag.

                     Constraints: Tag keys are  case-sensitive  and  accept  a
                     maximum  of  127  Unicode  characters. May not begin with
                     aws: .

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of the tag.

                     Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and  accept  a
                     maximum of 255 Unicode characters.

          DedicatedHostIds -> (list)
              The  IDs of the Dedicated Hosts to associate with the event win-
              dow.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          InstanceIds=string,string,InstanceTags=[{Key=string,Value=string},{Key=string,Value=string}],DedicatedHostIds=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "InstanceIds": ["string", ...],
            "InstanceTags": [
              {
                "Key": "string",
                "Value": "string"
              }
              ...
            ],
            "DedicatedHostIds": ["string", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
