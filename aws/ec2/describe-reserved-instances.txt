OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          One or more filters.

          o availability-zone - The Availability Zone where the  Reserved  In-
            stance can be used.

          o duration  -  The  duration  of  the Reserved Instance (one year or
            three years), in seconds (31536000 | 94608000 ).

          o end - The time when the Reserved Instance  expires  (for  example,
            2015-08-07T11:54:42.000Z).

          o fixed-price - The purchase price of the Reserved Instance (for ex-
            ample, 9800.0).

          o instance-type - The instance type that is covered by the  reserva-
            tion.

          o scope - The scope of the Reserved Instance (Region or Availability
            Zone ).

          o product-description - The Reserved Instance product  platform  de-
            scription.  Instances  that  include  (Amazon  VPC) in the product
            platform description will only be displayed to EC2-Classic account
            holders  and  are for use with Amazon VPC (Linux/UNIX | Linux/UNIX
            (Amazon VPC) | SUSE Linux | SUSE Linux (Amazon VPC) | Red Hat  En-
            terprise  Linux  | Red Hat Enterprise Linux (Amazon VPC) | Red Hat
            Enterprise Linux with HA (Amazon VPC) | Windows | Windows  (Amazon
            VPC)  | Windows with SQL Server Standard | Windows with SQL Server
            Standard (Amazon VPC) | Windows with SQL Server Web | Windows with
            SQL Server Web (Amazon VPC) | Windows with SQL Server Enterprise |

          o reserved-instances-id - The ID of the Reserved Instance.

          o start - The time at which the Reserved Instance  purchase  request

          o state  - The state of the Reserved Instance (payment-pending | ac-
            tive | payment-failed | retired ).

          o tag:<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the re-
            source.  Use  the  tag key in the filter name and the tag value as
            the filter value. For example, to find all resources that  have  a
            tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for
            the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

          o tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this fil-

            gardless of the tag value.

          o usage-price - The usage price of the Reserved Instance,  per  hour
            (for example, 0.84).

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --offering-class (string)
          Describes whether the Reserved Instance is Standard or Convertible.

          Possible values:

          o standard

          o convertible

       --reserved-instances-ids (list)
          One or more Reserved Instance IDs.

          Default: Describes all your Reserved Instances, or only those other-
          wise specified.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --offering-type (string)
          The  Reserved  Instance  offering  type. If you are using tools that
          predate the 2011-11-01 API version, you  only  have  access  to  the
          Medium Utilization Reserved Instance offering type.

          Possible values:

          o Heavy Utilization

          o Medium Utilization

          o Light Utilization

          o No Upfront

          o Partial Upfront

          o All Upfront

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
