DESCRIBE-BYOIP-CIDRS()                                  DESCRIBE-BYOIP-CIDRS()



NAME
       describe-byoip-cidrs -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the IP address ranges that were specified in calls to  Provi-
       sionByoipCidr .

       To describe the address pools that were created  when  you  provisioned
       the  address ranges, use  DescribePublicIpv4Pools or  DescribeIpv6Pools
       .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-byoip-cidrs is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: ByoipCidrs

SYNOPSIS
            describe-byoip-cidrs
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe your provisioned address ranges

       The following describe-byoip-cidrs example displays details  about  the
       public IPv4 address ranges that you provisioned for use by AWS.

          aws ec2 describe-byoip-cidrs

       Output:

          {
              "ByoipCidrs": [
                  {
                      "Cidr": "203.0.113.25/24",
                      "StatusMessage": "ipv4pool-ec2-1234567890abcdef0",
                      "State": "provisioned"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       ByoipCidrs -> (list)
          Information about your address ranges.

          (structure)
              Information  about  an address range that is provisioned for use
              with your Amazon Web Services resources through bring  your  own
              IP addresses (BYOIP).

              Cidr -> (string)
                 The address range, in CIDR notation.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the address range.

              StatusMessage -> (string)
                 Upon success, contains the ID of the address pool. Otherwise,
                 contains an error message.

              State -> (string)
                 The state of the address pool.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.
