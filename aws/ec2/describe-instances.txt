DESCRIBE-INSTANCES()                                      DESCRIBE-INSTANCES()



NAME
       describe-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified instances or all instances.

       If  you  specify instance IDs, the output includes information for only
       the specified instances. If you specify filters,  the  output  includes
       information  for only those instances that meet the filter criteria. If
       you do not specify instance IDs or filters, the output includes  infor-
       mation  for  all  instances, which can affect performance. We recommend
       that you use pagination to ensure that the  operation  returns  quickly
       and successfully.

       If  you specify an instance ID that is not valid, an error is returned.
       If you specify an instance that you do not own, it is not  included  in
       the output.

       Recently  terminated  instances  might  appear in the returned results.
       This interval is usually less than one hour.

       If you describe instances in the rare case where an  Availability  Zone
       is  experiencing a service disruption and you specify instance IDs that
       are in the affected zone, or do not specify any instance  IDs  at  all,
       the call fails. If you describe instances and specify only instance IDs
       that are in an unaffected zone, the call works normally.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-instances is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Reservations

            multiple  instances using the same launch request. For example, if
            you launch one instance, you get one reservation ID. If you launch
            ten  instances  using  the  same  launch request, you also get one
            reservation ID.

          o root-device-name - The device name of the root device volume  (for

            stance-store ).

          o source-dest-check  -  Indicates  whether  the  instance   performs
            source/destination  checking.  A value of true means that checking
            is enabled, and false means that checking is disabled.  The  value
            must be false for the instance to perform network address transla-
            tion (NAT) in your VPC.

          o spot-instance-request-id - The ID of the Spot Instance request.

          o state-reason-code - The reason code for the state change.

          o subnet-id - The ID of the subnet for the instance.

          o tag:<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the re-
            source.  Use  the  tag key in the filter name and the tag value as
            the filter value. For example, to find all resources that  have  a
            tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for
            the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

          o tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this fil-
            ter to find all resources that have a tag with a specific key, re-
            gardless of the tag value.

          o tenancy - The tenancy of an instance (dedicated | default  |  host
            ).

          o virtualization-type  -  The  virtualization  type  of the instance
            (paravirtual | hvm ).

          o vpc-id - The ID of the VPC that the instance is running in.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --instance-ids (list)
          The instance IDs.

          Default: Describes all your instances.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's

       Example 2: To filter for instances with the specified type

       The  following describe-instances example uses filters to scope the re-
       sults to instances of the specified type.

          aws ec2 describe-instances \
              --filters Name=instance-type,Values=m5.large

       For sample of output, see Example 1.

       For more information, see Describing instances in a placement group  in
       the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

       Example  3:  To filter for instances with the specified type and Avail-
       ability Zone

       The following describe-instances example uses multiple filters to scope
       the  results  to instances with the specified type that are also in the
       specified Availability Zone.

          aws ec2 describe-instances \
              --filters Name=instance-type,Values=t2.micro,t3.micro Name=availability-zone,Values=us-east-2c

       For sample of output, see Example 1.

       For more information, see Describing instances in a placement group  in
       the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

       Example  4:  To filter for instances with the specified type and Avail-
       ability Zone using a JSON file

       The following describe-instances example uses a JSON input file to per-
       form  the same filtering as the previous example. When filters get more
       complicated, they can be easier to specify in a JSON file.

          aws ec2 describe-instances \
              --filters file://filters.json

       Contents of filters.json:

          [
              {
                  "Name": "instance-type",
                  "Values": ["t2.micro", "t3.micro"]
              },
              {
                  "Name": "availability-zone",
                  "Values": ["us-east-2c"]
              }
          ]

       For sample of output, see Example 1.

       For more information, see Describing instances in a placement group  in
       the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

       Example 5: To filter for instances with the specified Owner tag

       The  following describe-instances example uses tag filters to scope the
       results to instances that  have  a  tag  with  the  specified  tag  key
       (Owner), regardless of the tag value.

          aws ec2 describe-instances \
              --filters "Name=tag-key,Values=Owner"

       For sample of output, see Example 1.

       For  more information, see Describing instances in a placement group in
       the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

       Example 6: To filter for instances with the specified my-team tag value

       The following describe-instances example uses tag filters to scope  the
       results  to  instances  that  have  a  tag with the specified tag value
       (my-team), regardless of the tag key.

          aws ec2 describe-instances \
              --filters "Name=tag-value,Values=my-team"

       For sample of output, see Example 1.

       For more information, see Describing instances in a placement group  in
       the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

       Example  7:  To  filter  for instances with the specified Owner tag and
       my-team value

       The following describe-instances example uses tag filters to scope  the
       results to instances that have the specified tag (Owner=my-team).
