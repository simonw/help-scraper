TERMINATE-INSTANCES()                                    TERMINATE-INSTANCES()



NAME
       terminate-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Shuts  down  the  specified instances. This operation is idempotent; if
       you terminate an instance more than once, each call succeeds.

       If you specify multiple instances and the request fails  (for  example,
       because  of  a single incorrect instance ID), none of the instances are
       terminated.

       If you terminate multiple instances across multiple Availability Zones,
       and  one or more of the specified instances are enabled for termination
       protection, the request fails with the following results:

       o The specified instances that are in the same Availability Zone as the
         protected instance are not terminated.

       o The  specified  instances  that  are in different Availability Zones,
         where no other specified instances are  protected,  are  successfully
         terminated.

       For example, say you have the following instances:

       o Instance A: us-east-1a ; Not protected

       o Instance B: us-east-1a ; Not protected

       o Instance C: us-east-1b ; Protected

       o Instance D: us-east-1b ; not protected

       If you attempt to terminate all of these instances in the same request,
       the request reports failure with the following results:

       o Instance A and Instance B are successfully terminated because none of
         the  specified  instances  in  us-east-1a are enabled for termination
         protection.

       o Instance C and Instance D fail to terminate because at least  one  of
         the  specified  instances  in  us-east-1b (Instance C) is enabled for
         termination protection.

       Terminated instances remain visible  after  termination  (for  approxi-
       mately one hour).

       By  default, Amazon EC2 deletes all EBS volumes that were attached when
       the instance launched. Volumes attached after instance launch  continue
       running.

       You  can  stop, start, and terminate EBS-backed instances. You can only
       terminate instance store-backed instances. What happens to an  instance
       differs  if  you stop it or terminate it. For example, when you stop an
       instance, the root device and any other devices  attached  to  the  in-
       stance  persist.  When you terminate an instance, any attached EBS vol-
       umes with the DeleteOnTermination block device mapping parameter set to
       true  are automatically deleted. For more information about the differ-
       ences between stopping and terminating instances, see Instance  lifecy-
       cle in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

       nating your instance in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --instance-ids (list)
          The IDs of the instances.

          Constraints: Up to 1000 instance IDs. We recommend breaking up  this
          request into smaller batches.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To terminate an Amazon EC2 instance

       This example terminates the specified instance.

       Command:

          aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0

       Output:

          {
              "TerminatingInstances": [
                  {
                      "InstanceId": "i-1234567890abcdef0",
                      "CurrentState": {
                          "Code": 32,
                          "Name": "shutting-down"
                      },
                      "PreviousState": {
                          "Code": 16,

OUTPUT
       TerminatingInstances -> (list)
          Information about the terminated instances.

          (structure)
              Describes an instance state change.

              CurrentState -> (structure)
                 The current state of the instance.

                 Code -> (integer)
                     The state of the instance as a 16-bit unsigned integer.

                     The  high  byte  is  all  of  the  bits  between  2^8 and
                     (2^16)-1, which equals decimal  values  between  256  and
                     65,535. These numerical values are used for internal pur-
                     poses and should be ignored.

                     The low byte is all of the bits between 2^0 and  (2^8)-1,
                     which equals decimal values between 0 and 255.

                     The  valid  values for instance-state-code will all be in
                     the range of the low byte and they are:

                     o 0 : pending

                     o 16 : running

                     o 32 : shutting-down

                     o 48 : terminated

                     o 64 : stopping

                     o 80 : stopped

                     You can ignore the high byte value by zeroing out all  of
                     the bits above 2^8 or 256 in decimal.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The current state of the instance.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the instance.

              PreviousState -> (structure)
                 The previous state of the instance.

                 Code -> (integer)
                     The state of the instance as a 16-bit unsigned integer.

                     The  high  byte  is  all  of  the  bits  between  2^8 and
                     (2^16)-1, which equals decimal  values  between  256  and
                     65,535. These numerical values are used for internal pur-
                     poses and should be ignored.

                     The low byte is all of the bits between 2^0 and  (2^8)-1,
                     which equals decimal values between 0 and 255.

                     The  valid  values for instance-state-code will all be in
                     the range of the low byte and they are:

                     o 0 : pending

                     o 16 : running

                     o 32 : shutting-down

                     o 48 : terminated

                     o 64 : stopping

                     o 80 : stopped

                     You can ignore the high byte value by zeroing out all  of
                     the bits above 2^8 or 256 in decimal.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The current state of the instance.
