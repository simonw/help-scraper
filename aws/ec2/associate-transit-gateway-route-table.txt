NAME
       associate-transit-gateway-route-table -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  the specified attachment with the specified transit gateway
       route table. You can associate only one route table with an attachment.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            associate-transit-gateway-route-table
          --transit-gateway-route-table-id <value>
          --transit-gateway-attachment-id <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --transit-gateway-route-table-id (string)
          The ID of the transit gateway route table.

       --transit-gateway-attachment-id (string)
          The ID of the attachment.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  associate a  transit gateway route table with a transit gateway at-
       tachment

       The following example associates the specified  transit  gateway  route
       table with the specified VPC attachment.

          aws ec2 associate-transit-gateway-route-table \
              --transit-gateway-route-table-id tgw-rtb-002573ed1eEXAMPLE \
              --transit-gateway-attachment-id tgw-attach-0b5968d3b6EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "Association": {
                  "TransitGatewayRouteTableId": "tgw-rtb-002573ed1eEXAMPLE",
                  "TransitGatewayAttachmentId": "tgw-attach-0b5968d3b6EXAMPLE",
                  "ResourceId": "vpc-0065acced4EXAMPLE",
                  "ResourceType": "vpc",
                  "State": "associating"
              }
          }
