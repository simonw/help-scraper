          o ingress

          o egress

       --rule-number (integer)
          The number of the Traffic Mirror rule. This number  must  be  unique
          for  each  Traffic  Mirror  rule in a given direction. The rules are
          processed in ascending order by rule number.

       --rule-action (string)
          The action to assign to the rule.

          Possible values:

       --destination-port-range (structure)
          The destination ports that are associated with  the  Traffic  Mirror
          rule.

          FromPort -> (integer)
              The first port in the Traffic Mirror port range. This applies to
              the TCP and UDP protocols.

          ToPort -> (integer)
              The last port in the Traffic Mirror port range. This applies  to
              the TCP and UDP protocols.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FromPort=integer,ToPort=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FromPort": integer,
            "ToPort": integer
          }

       --source-port-range (structure)
          The port range to assign to the Traffic Mirror rule.

          FromPort -> (integer)
              The first port in the Traffic Mirror port range. This applies to
              the TCP and UDP protocols.

          ToPort -> (integer)
              The last port in the Traffic Mirror port range. This applies  to
              the TCP and UDP protocols.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FromPort=integer,ToPort=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FromPort": integer,
            "ToPort": integer
          }

       --protocol (integer)
          The protocol, for example TCP, to assign to the Traffic Mirror rule.

       --destination-cidr-block (string)
          The destination CIDR block to assign to the Traffic Mirror rule.

       --source-cidr-block (string)
          The source CIDR block to assign to the Traffic Mirror rule.

       --description (string)
          The description to assign to the Traffic Mirror rule.

       --remove-fields (list)
          The  properties that you want to remove from the Traffic Mirror fil-
          ter rule.

          When you remove a property from a Traffic Mirror  filter  rule,  the
          property is set to the default.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            destination-port-range
            source-port-range
            protocol
            description

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To modify a traffic mirror filter rule

       The following modify-traffic-mirror-filter-rule  example  modifies  the
       description of the specified traffic mirror filter rule.

          aws ec2 modify-traffic-mirror-filter-rule \
              --traffic-mirror-filter-rule-id tmfr-0ca76e0e08EXAMPLE \
