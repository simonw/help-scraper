GET-CONSOLE-OUTPUT()                                      GET-CONSOLE-OUTPUT()



NAME
       get-console-output -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the  console  output  for  the  specified instance. For Linux in-
       stances, the instance console output displays the exact console  output
       that  would  normally  be displayed on a physical monitor attached to a
       computer. For Windows instances, the instance console  output  includes
       the last three system event log errors.

       By  default,  the  console output returns buffered information that was
       posted shortly after an instance transition state (start, stop, reboot,
       or  terminate). This information is available for at least one hour af-
       ter the most recent post. Only the most recent 64 KB of console  output
       is available.

       You  can  optionally  retrieve  the latest serial console output at any
       time during the instance lifecycle. This option  is  supported  on  in-
       stance types that use the Nitro hypervisor.

       For  more  information,  see  Instance console output in the Amazon EC2
       User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            get-console-output
          --instance-id <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--latest | --no-latest]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of the instance.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --latest | --no-latest (boolean)
          When enabled, retrieves the latest console output for the instance.

          Default: disabled (false )

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To get the console output

       The  following  get-console-output  example gets the console output for
       the specified Linux instance.

          aws ec2 get-console-output \
              --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0

       Output:

          {
              "InstanceId": "i-1234567890abcdef0",
              "Timestamp": "2013-07-25T21:23:53.000Z",
              "Output": "..."
          }

       User Guide.

       Example 2: To get the latest console output

       The following get-console-output example gets the latest console output
       for the specified Linux instance.

          aws ec2 get-console-output \
              --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 \
              --latest \
              --output text

       Output:
