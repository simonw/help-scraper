DESCRIBE-FLOW-LOGS()                                      DESCRIBE-FLOW-LOGS()



NAME
       describe-flow-logs -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  one  or more flow logs. To view the information in your flow
       logs (the log streams for the network interfaces),  you  must  use  the
       CloudWatch Logs console or the CloudWatch Logs API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-flow-logs  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: FlowLogs

SYNOPSIS
            describe-flow-logs
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--filter <value>]
          [--flow-log-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --filter (list)
          One or more filters.

          o deliver-log-status  -  The  status of the logs delivery (SUCCESS |
            FAILED ).

          o log-destination-type - The type of destination to which  the  flow
            log   publishes   data.   Possible   destination   types   include
            cloud-watch-logs and s3 .

          o flow-log-id - The ID of the flow log.

          o log-group-name - The name of the log group.

          o resource-id - The ID of the VPC, subnet, or network interface.

          o traffic-type - The type of traffic (ACCEPT | REJECT | ALL ).

          o tag :<key> - The key/value combination of a tag  assigned  to  the
            resource.  Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as
            the filter value. For example, to find all resources that  have  a
            tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for
            the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

          o tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this fil-
            ter  to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, re-
            gardless of the tag value.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --flow-log-ids (list)
          One or more flow log IDs.

          Constraint: Maximum of 1000 flow log IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              ]
          }

       Example 2: To describe a subset of your flow logs

       The  following  describe-flow-logs example uses a filter to display de-
       tails for only those flow logs that are in the specified log  group  in
       Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

          aws ec2 describe-flow-logs \
              --filter "Name=log-group-name,Values=MyFlowLogs"

OUTPUT
       FlowLogs -> (list)
          Information about the flow logs.

          (structure)
              Describes a flow log.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the flow log was created.

              DeliverLogsErrorMessage -> (string)
                 Information about the error that occurred. Rate limited indi-
                 cates that CloudWatch Logs throttling has  been  applied  for
                 one  or  more  network interfaces, or that you've reached the
                 limit on the number of log groups that you can create. Access
                 error  indicates  that  the IAM role associated with the flow
                 log does not have sufficient permissions to publish to Cloud-
                 Watch Logs. Unknown error indicates an internal error.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the resource on which the flow log was created.

              TrafficType -> (string)
                 The type of traffic captured for the flow log.

              LogDestinationType -> (string)
                 The  type  of  destination to which the flow log data is pub-
                 lished. Flow log data can be published to CloudWatch Logs  or
                 Amazon S3.

              LogDestination -> (string)

                 lished. If the flow log publishes to Amazon S3, this  element
                 indicates  the  ARN of the Amazon S3 bucket to which the data
                 is published.

              LogFormat -> (string)
                 The format of the flow log record.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags for the flow log.

                 (structure)

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept  a
                        maximum  of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        a maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

              MaxAggregationInterval -> (integer)
                 The maximum interval of time, in seconds, during which a flow
                 of packets is captured and aggregated into a flow log record.

                 When a network interface is attached  to  a  Nitro-based  in-
                 stance  ,  the  aggregation  interval is always 60 seconds (1
                 minute) or less, regardless of the specified value.

                 Valid Values: 60 | 600

                     The format for the flow log.

                 HiveCompatiblePartitions -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether to  use  Hive-compatible  prefixes  for
                     flow logs stored in Amazon S3.

                 PerHourPartition -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether to partition the flow log per hour.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.
