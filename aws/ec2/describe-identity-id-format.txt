DESCRIBE-IDENTITY-ID-FORMAT()                    DESCRIBE-IDENTITY-ID-FORMAT()



NAME
       describe-identity-id-format -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  ID  format settings for resources for the specified IAM
       user, IAM role, or root user. For example, you can  view  the  resource
       types that are enabled for longer IDs. This request only returns infor-
       mation about resource types whose ID formats can be modified;  it  does
       not  return  information  about other resource types. For more informa-
       tion, see Resource IDs in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

       The following resource types  support  longer  IDs:  bundle  |  conver-
       sion-task  |  customer-gateway | dhcp-options | elastic-ip-allocation |
       elastic-ip-association | export-task | flow-log | image | import-task |
       instance  |  internet-gateway | network-acl | network-acl-association |
       network-interface | network-interface-attachment | prefix-list | reser-
       vation | route-table | route-table-association | security-group | snap-
       shot  |  subnet  |  subnet-cidr-block-association  |  volume  |  vpc  |
       vpc-cidr-block-association  |  vpc-endpoint  | vpc-peering-connection |
       vpn-connection | vpn-gateway .

       These settings apply to the principal specified in the request. They do
       not apply to the principal that makes the request.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-identity-id-format
          --principal-arn <value>
          [--resource <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --principal-arn (string)
          The ARN of the principal, which can be an IAM role, IAM user, or the
          root user.

       --resource (string)
          The type of resource: bundle | conversion-task | customer-gateway  |
          dhcp-options  | elastic-ip-allocation | elastic-ip-association | ex-
          port-task | flow-log | image  |  import-task  |  instance  |  inter-
          net-gateway | network-acl | network-acl-association | network-inter-
          face | network-interface-attachment | prefix-list  |  reservation  |
          route-table  | route-table-association | security-group | snapshot |
          subnet  |   subnet-cidr-block-association   |   volume   |   vpc   |
          vpc-cidr-block-association | vpc-endpoint | vpc-peering-connection |
          vpn-connection | vpn-gateway

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe the ID format for an IAM role

       The following describe-identity-id-format example describes the ID for-
       mat received by instances created by the IAM role EC2Role in  your  AWS
       account.

          aws ec2 describe-identity-id-format \
              --principal-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-iam-role \
              --resource instance

       The  following output indicates that instances created by this role re-
       ceive IDs in long ID format.

          {
              "Statuses": [
                  {
                      "Deadline": "2016-12-15T00:00:00Z",
                      "Resource": "instance",
                      "UseLongIds": true
                  }
              ]
          }

       To describe the ID format for an IAM user

       The following describe-identity-id-format example describes the ID for-
       mat received by snapshots created by the IAM user AdminUser in your AWS
       account.

          aws ec2 describe-identity-id-format \
              --principal-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/AdminUser \
              --resource snapshot

       The output indicates that snapshots created by this user receive IDs in
       long ID format.

          {
              "Statuses": [
                  {
                      "Deadline": "2016-12-15T00:00:00Z",
                      "Resource": "snapshot",
                      "UseLongIds": true
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Statuses -> (list)
          Information about the ID format for the resources.

          (structure)
              Describes the ID format for a resource.

              Deadline -> (timestamp)
                 The date in UTC at which you are permanently switched over to
                 using longer IDs. If a deadline is not yet available for this
                 resource type, this field is not returned.

              Resource -> (string)
                 The type of resource.

              UseLongIds -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  longer IDs (17-character IDs) are enabled
                 for the resource.
