CREATE-CUSTOMER-GATEWAY()                            CREATE-CUSTOMER-GATEWAY()



NAME
       create-customer-gateway -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides information to Amazon Web Services about your customer gateway
       device. The customer gateway device is the appliance at your end of the
       VPN connection. You must provide the IP address of the customer gateway
       devices external interface. The IP address must be static  and  can  be
       behind a device performing network address translation (NAT).

       For  devices  that use Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), you can also pro-
       vide the device's BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN). You  can  use  an
       existing  ASN  assigned  to  your network. If you don't have an ASN al-
       ready, you can use a private ASN. For more  information,  see  Customer
       gateway  options for your Site-to-Site VPN connection in the Amazon Web
       Services Site-to-Site VPN User Guide .

       To create more than one customer gateway with the same VPN type, IP ad-
       dress,  and  BGP  ASN,  specify  a unique device name for each customer
       gateway. An identical request returns information  about  the  existing
       customer gateway; it doesn't create a new customer gateway.

            }
            ...
          ]

       --device-name (string)
          A name for the customer gateway device.

          Length Constraints: Up to 255 characters.

       --ip-address (string)
          IPv4 address for the customer gateway  device's  outside  interface.
          The address must be static.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
