NAME
       describe-ipams -

DESCRIPTION
       Get information about your IPAM pools.

       For  more  information,  see  What is IPAM? in the Amazon VPC IPAM User
       Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-ipams is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Ipams

SYNOPSIS
            describe-ipams
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--ipam-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without actually making the request and provides an error  response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters for the request. For more information about fil-
          tering, see Filtering CLI output .

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --ipam-ids (list)
          The IDs of the IPAMs you want information on.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          (structure)
              IPAM is a VPC feature that you can use to automate your  IP  ad-
              dress  management workflows including assigning, tracking, trou-
              bleshooting, and auditing IP addresses across  Amazon  Web  Ser-
              vices  Regions  and accounts throughout your Amazon Web Services
              Organization. For more information, see What  is  IPAM?  in  the
              Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide .

              IpamRegion -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Region of the IPAM.

              PublicDefaultScopeId -> (string)

              PrivateDefaultScopeId -> (string)
                 The ID of the IPAM's default private scope.

              ScopeCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of scopes in the IPAM. The scope quota is 5. For
                 more information on quotas, see Quotas in IPAM in the  Amazon
                 VPC IPAM User Guide .

              Description -> (string)

              OperatingRegions -> (list)
                 The operating Regions for an IPAM. Operating Regions are Ama-
                 zon Web Services Regions where the IPAM is allowed to  manage
                 IP  address CIDRs. IPAM only discovers and monitors resources
                 in the Amazon Web Services Regions you  select  as  operating
                 Regions.

                 For  more  information about operating Regions, see Create an
                 IPAM in the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide .

                 (structure)

                     Amazon  Web Services Regions where the IPAM is allowed to
                     manage IP address CIDRs. IPAM only discovers and monitors
                     resources  in  the Amazon Web Services Regions you select
                     as operating Regions.

                     For more information about operating Regions, see  Create

                 Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value  as  the
                 filter  value. For example, to find all resources that have a
                 tag with  the  key  Owner  and  the  value  TeamA  ,  specify
