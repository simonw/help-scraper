NAME
       enable-fast-snapshot-restores -

DESCRIPTION
       Enables fast snapshot restores for the specified snapshots in the spec-
       ified Availability Zones.

       You get the full benefit of fast snapshot restores after they enter the
       enabled  state. To get the current state of fast snapshot restores, use
       DescribeFastSnapshotRestores . To disable fast snapshot  restores,  use
       DisableFastSnapshotRestores .

       For  more information, see Amazon EBS fast snapshot restore in the Ama-
       zon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            enable-fast-snapshot-restores
          --availability-zones <value>
          --source-snapshot-ids <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --availability-zones (list)
          One or more Availability Zones. For example, us-east-2a .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --source-snapshot-ids (list)
          The   IDs   of    one    or    more    snapshots.    For    example,
          snap-1234567890abcdef0  . You can specify a snapshot that was shared
          with you from another Amazon Web Services account.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To enable fast snapshot restore

       The  following enable-fast-snapshot-restores example enables fast snap-
       shot restore for the specified snapshot in the  specified  Availability
       Zones.

          aws ec2 enable-fast-snapshot-restores \
              --availability-zones us-east-2a us-east-2b \
