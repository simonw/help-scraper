NAME
       describe-key-pairs -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified key pairs or all of your key pairs.

       For  more  information about key pairs, see Amazon EC2 key pairs in the
       Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-key-pairs
          [--filters <value>]
          [--key-names <value>]
          [--key-pair-ids <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--include-public-key | --no-include-public-key]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          The filters.

          o key-pair-id - The ID of the key pair.

          o fingerprint - The fingerprint of the key pair.

          o key-name - The name of the key pair.

          o tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this fil-
            ter  to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, re-
            gardless of the tag value.

          o tag :<key> - The key/value combination of a tag  assigned  to  the
            resource.  Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as
            the filter value. For example, to find all resources that  have  a
            tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for
            the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --key-names (list)
          The key pair names.

          Default: Describes all of your key pairs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --key-pair-ids (list)
          The IDs of the key pairs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --include-public-key | --no-include-public-key (boolean)
          If true , the public key material is included in the response.

          Default: false

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To display a key pair

       This example displays the fingerprint for the key pair named MyKeyPair.

       Command:

          aws ec2 describe-key-pairs --key-name MyKeyPair

       Output:

          {
              "KeyPairs": [
                  {
                      "KeyName": "MyKeyPair",
                      "KeyFingerprint": "1f:51:ae:28:bf:89:e9:d8:1f:25:5d:37:2d:7d:b8:ca:9f:f5:f1:6f"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       KeyPairs -> (list)
          Information about the key pairs.

          (structure)
              Describes a key pair.

              KeyPairId -> (string)
                 The ID of the key pair.

              KeyFingerprint -> (string)
                 If you used  CreateKeyPair to create the key pair:

                 o For  RSA key pairs, the key fingerprint is the SHA-1 digest
                   of the DER encoded private key.

                 o For  ED25519  key  pairs,  the  key  fingerprint   is   the
                   base64-encoded  SHA-256  digest,  which  is the default for
                   OpenSSH, starting with OpenSSH 6.8 .

                 If you used  ImportKeyPair to provide Amazon Web Services the
                 public key:

                 o For  RSA  key  pairs, the key fingerprint is the MD5 public
                   key fingerprint as specified in section 4 of RFC4716.

                 o For  ED25519  key  pairs,  the  key  fingerprint   is   the
                   base64-encoded  SHA-256  digest,  which  is the default for
                   OpenSSH, starting with OpenSSH 6.8 .

              KeyName -> (string)
                 The name of the key pair.

              KeyType -> (string)
                 The type of key pair.

              Tags -> (list)
                 Any tags applied to the key pair.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept  a
                        maximum  of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and  accept
                        a maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

              PublicKey -> (string)
                 The public key material.

              CreateTime -> (timestamp)
                 If  you  used  Amazon EC2 to create the key pair, this is the
                 date and time when the key was created, in ISO 8601 date-time
                 format , in the UTC time zone.

                 If  you  imported an existing key pair to Amazon EC2, this is
                 the date and time the key was imported, in ISO 8601 date-time
                 format , in the UTC time zone.
