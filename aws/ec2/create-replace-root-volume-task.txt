CREATE-REPLACE-ROOT-VOLUME-TASK()            CREATE-REPLACE-ROOT-VOLUME-TASK()



NAME
       create-replace-root-volume-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a root volume replacement task for an Amazon EC2 instance. The
       root volume can either be restored to its initial launch state,  or  it
       can be restored using a specific snapshot.

       For  more  information, see Replace a root volume in the Amazon Elastic
       Compute Cloud User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-replace-root-volume-task
          --instance-id <value>
          [--snapshot-id <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--tag-specifications <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of the instance for which to replace the root volume.

       --snapshot-id (string)
          The ID of the snapshot from which to restore  the  replacement  root
          volume.  If  you  want  to  restore the volume to the initial launch
          state, omit this parameter.

       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier you provide to ensure the  idempo-
          tency  of  the request. If you do not specify a client token, a ran-
          domly generated token is used for the request to ensure idempotency.
          For more information, see Ensuring idempotency .

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --tag-specifications (list)
          The tags to apply to the root volume replacement task.

          (structure)
              The tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being  cre-
              ated.

              NOTE:
                 The  Valid  Values  lists  all the resource types that can be
                 tagged. However, the action you're using  might  not  support
                 tagging  all of these resource types. If you try to tag a re-
                 source type that is unsupported for the action you're  using,
                 you'll get an error.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to tag on creation.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags to apply to the resource.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a
                        maximum of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin  with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag values are case-sensitive and accept
                        a maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To restore a root volume to its initial launch state

       volume of instance i-0123456789abcdefa to its initial launch state.

          aws ec2 create-replace-root-volume-task \
              --instance-id i-0123456789abcdefa

       Output:

       volume      of     instance     i-0123456789abcdefa     to     snapshot
       snap-0abcdef1234567890.
