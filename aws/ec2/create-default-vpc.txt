CREATE-DEFAULT-VPC()                                      CREATE-DEFAULT-VPC()



NAME
       create-default-vpc -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  default  VPC  with a size /16 IPv4 CIDR block and a default
       subnet in each Availability Zone. For more information about the compo-
       nents of a default VPC, see Default VPC and default subnets in the Ama-
       zon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide . You cannot  specify  the  compo-
       nents of the default VPC yourself.

       If you deleted your previous default VPC, you can create a default VPC.
       You cannot have more than one default VPC per Region.

       If your account supports EC2-Classic, you cannot  use  this  action  to
       create a default VPC in a Region that supports EC2-Classic. If you want
       a default VPC in a Region that supports EC2-Classic, see "I really want
       a  default  VPC  for my existing EC2 account. Is that possible?" in the
       Default VPCs FAQ .

       NOTE:
          We are retiring EC2-Classic on August 15, 2022.  We  recommend  that
          you  migrate  from  EC2-Classic  to a VPC. For more information, see
          Migrate from EC2-Classic to a VPC  in  the  Amazon  Elastic  Compute
          Cloud User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            create-default-vpc
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
