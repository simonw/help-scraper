SYNOPSIS
            create-store-image-task
          --image-id <value>
          --bucket <value>
          [--s3-object-tags <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --image-id (string)
          The ID of the AMI.

       --bucket (string)
          The name of the Amazon S3 bucket in which the  AMI  object  will  be
          stored. The bucket must be in the Region in which the request is be-
          ing made. The AMI object appears in the bucket only after the upload
          task has completed.

       --s3-object-tags (list)
          The  tags to apply to the AMI object that will be stored in the Ama-
          zon S3 bucket.

          (structure)
              The tags to apply to the AMI object that will be stored  in  the
              Amazon  S3  bucket.  For more information, see Categorizing your
              storage using tags in the Amazon  Simple  Storage  Service  User
              Guide .

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

                 Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and can be up to 128
                 Unicode characters in length. May not begin with aws :.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

                 Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and can be  up  to
                 256 Unicode characters in length.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To store an AMI in an S3 bucket

       The  following  create-store-image-task  example stores an AMI in an S3
       bucket. Specify the ID of the AMI and the name  of  the  S3  bucket  in
       which to store the AMI.

          aws ec2 create-store-image-task \
            --image-id ami-1234567890abcdef0 \
            --bucket my-ami-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "ObjectKey": "ami-1234567890abcdef0.bin"
          }

OUTPUT
       ObjectKey -> (string)
          The name of the stored AMI object in the S3 bucket.
