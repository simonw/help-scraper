SYNOPSIS
            provision-public-ipv4-pool-cidr
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --ipam-pool-id <value>
          --pool-id <value>
          --netmask-length <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without  actually making the request and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --ipam-pool-id (string)
          The ID of the IPAM pool you would like to use to allocate this CIDR.

       --pool-id (string)
          The ID of the public IPv4 pool you would like to use for this CIDR.

       --netmask-length (integer)
          The  netmask  length  of  the CIDR you would like to allocate to the
          public IPv4 pool.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PoolId -> (string)
          The ID of the pool that you want to provision the CIDR to.

       PoolAddressRange -> (structure)
          Describes an address range of an IPv4 address pool.

          FirstAddress -> (string)
              The first IP address in the range.

          LastAddress -> (string)
              The last IP address in the range.

          AddressCount -> (integer)
              The number of addresses in the range.

          AvailableAddressCount -> (integer)
              The number of available addresses in the range.
