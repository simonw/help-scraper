OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request. For more information, see Ensuring Idem-
          potency .

       --currency-code (string)
          The currency in which the totalUpfrontPrice , LimitPrice ,  and  to-
          talHourlyPrice  amounts  are  specified. At this time, the only sup-
          ported currency is USD .

          Possible values:

          o USD

       --host-id-set (list)

       --limit-price (string)
          The specified limit is checked against the total upfront cost of the
          reservation (calculated as the offering's upfront cost multiplied by
          the host count). If the total upfront cost is greater than the spec-
          ified price limit, the request fails. This is used  to  ensure  that
          the  purchase  does not exceed the expected upfront cost of the pur-
          chase. At this time, the only supported currency is USD . For  exam-
          ple, to indicate a limit price of USD 100, specify 100.00.

                 tagged.  However,  the  action you're using might not support
                 tagging all of these resource types. If you try to tag a  re-
                 source  type that is unsupported for the action you're using,

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
