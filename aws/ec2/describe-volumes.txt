DESCRIBE-VOLUMES()                                          DESCRIBE-VOLUMES()



NAME
       describe-volumes -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified EBS volumes or all of your EBS volumes.

       If  you  are  describing  a long list of volumes, we recommend that you
       paginate the output to make the list more  manageable.  The  MaxResults
       parameter sets the maximum number of results returned in a single page.
       If the list of results exceeds your MaxResults value, then that  number
       of  results is returned along with a NextToken value that can be passed
       to a subsequent DescribeVolumes request to retrieve the  remaining  re-
       sults.

       For  more  information about EBS volumes, see Amazon EBS volumes in the
       Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-volumes is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Volumes

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          The filters.

          o attachment.attach-time - The time stamp when the attachment initi-
            ated.

          o attachment.delete-on-termination - Whether the volume  is  deleted
            on instance termination.

          o attachment.device  - The device name specified in the block device
            mapping (for example, /dev/sda1 ).

          o attachment.instance-id - The ID of the instance the volume is  at-
            tached to.

          o attachment.status  -  The attachment state (attaching | attached |
            detaching ).

          o availability-zone - The Availability Zone in which the volume  was
            created.

          o create-time - The time stamp when the volume was created.

          o encrypted  -  Indicates  whether  the  volume is encrypted (true |
            false )

          o multi-attach-enabled - Indicates whether the volume is enabled for
            Multi-Attach (true | false )

          o fast-restored  -  Indicates  whether the volume was created from a
            snapshot that is enabled for fast snapshot restore (true  |  false
            ).

          o size - The size of the volume, in GiB.

          o snapshot-id - The snapshot from which the volume was created.

          o status  - The state of the volume (creating | available | in-use |
            deleting | deleted | error ).

          o tag :<key> - The key/value combination of a tag  assigned  to  the
            resource.  Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as
            the filter value. For example, to find all resources that  have  a
            tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for
            the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

          o tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this fil-
            ter  to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, re-
            gardless of the tag value.

          o volume-id - The volume ID.

          o volume-type - The Amazon EBS volume type (gp2 | gp3 | io1 | io2  |
            st1 | sc1 | standard )

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --volume-ids (list)
          The volume IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       Example 2: To describe volumes that are attached to a specific instance

       The  following  describe-volumes example describes all volumes that are
       both attached to the specified instance and set to delete when the  in-
       stance terminates.

          aws ec2 describe-volumes \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --filters Name=attachment.instance-id,Values=i-1234567890abcdef0 Name=attachment.delete-on-termination,Values=true

       Example  3:  To  describe  available volumes in a specific Availability
       Zone

       The following describe-volumes example describes all volumes that  have
       a status of available and are in the specified Availability Zone.

          aws ec2 describe-volumes \
              --filters Name=status,Values=available Name=availability-zone,Values=us-east-1a

       For an example of the output for describe-volumes, see Example 1.

       Example 4: To describe volumes based on tags

       The  following describe-volumes example describes all volumes that have
       the tag key Name and a value that begins with Test. The output is  then
       filtered  with  a query that displays only the tags and IDs of the vol-
       umes.

          aws ec2 describe-volumes \
              --filters Name=tag:Name,Values=Test* \
              --query "Volumes[*].{ID:VolumeId,Tag:Tags}"
