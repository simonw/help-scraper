NAME
       accept-transit-gateway-peering-attachment -

DESCRIPTION
       Accepts  a  transit gateway peering attachment request. The peering at-
       tachment must be in the pendingAcceptance state.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            accept-transit-gateway-peering-attachment
          --transit-gateway-attachment-id <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --transit-gateway-attachment-id (string)
          The ID of the transit gateway attachment.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To accept a transit gateway peering attachment

       The following accept-transit-gateway-peering-attachment example accepts
       the  specified transit gateway peering attachment. The --region parame-
       ter specifies the Region that the accepter transit gateway  is  located
       in.

          aws ec2 accept-transit-gateway-peering-attachment \
              --transit-gateway-attachment-id tgw-attach-4455667788aabbccd \
              --region us-east-2

       Output:

          {
              "TransitGatewayPeeringAttachment": {
                  "TransitGatewayAttachmentId": "tgw-attach-4455667788aabbccd",
