DELETE-SERVICE()                                              DELETE-SERVICE()



NAME
       delete-service -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a specified service within a cluster. You can delete a service
       if you have no running tasks in it and the desired task count is  zero.
       If  the service is actively maintaining tasks, you can't delete it, and
       you must update the service to a desired task count of zero.  For  more
       information, see  UpdateService .

       NOTE:
          When you delete a service, if there are still running tasks that re-
          quire cleanup, the service status moves from ACTIVE  to  DRAINING  ,
          and the service is no longer visible in the console or in the  List-
          Services API operation. After all tasks have transitioned to  either
          STOPPING  or  STOPPED status, the service status moves from DRAINING
          to INACTIVE . Services in the DRAINING or INACTIVE status can  still
          be  viewed with the  DescribeServices API operation. However, in the
          future, INACTIVE services may be cleaned up and purged  from  Amazon
          ECS  record  keeping,  and  DescribeServices calls on those services
          return a ServiceNotFoundException error.

       WARNING:
          If you attempt to create a new service with the same name as an  ex-
          isting  service  in either ACTIVE or DRAINING status, you receive an
          error.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-service
          [--cluster <value>]
          --service <value>
          [--force | --no-force]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The short name or full Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the  cluster
          that  hosts  the service to delete. If you do not specify a cluster,
          the default cluster is assumed.

       --service (string)
          The name of the service to delete.

       --force | --no-force (boolean)
          If true , allows you to delete a service even if  it  wasn't  scaled
          down  to  zero tasks. It's only necessary to use this if the service
          uses the REPLICA scheduling strategy.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a service

       The  following ecs delete-service example deletes the specified service
       from a cluster. You can include the --force parameter to delete a  ser-
       vice even if it has not been scaled to zero tasks.

          aws ecs delete-service --cluster MyCluster --service MyService1 --force

       For  more  information, see Deleting a Service in the Amazon ECS Devel-
       oper Guide.

OUTPUT
       service -> (structure)
          The full description of the deleted service.

          serviceArn -> (string)
              The ARN that  identifies  the  service.  The  ARN  contains  the
              arn:aws:ecs  namespace,  followed  by the Region of the service,
              the Amazon Web Services account ID of  the  service  owner,  the
              service  namespace,  and  then  the  service  name. For example,
              arn:aws:ecs:region:012345678910:service/my-service .

          serviceName -> (string)
              The name of your service. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and  low-
              ercase),  numbers, underscores, and hyphens are allowed. Service
              names must be unique within a cluster.  However,  you  can  have
              similarly named services in multiple clusters within a Region or
              across multiple Regions.

          clusterArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  cluster  that  hosts  the
              service.

          loadBalancers -> (list)
              A  list of Elastic Load Balancing load balancer objects. It con-
              tains the load balancer name, the container name, and  the  con-
              tainer port to access from the load balancer. The container name
              is as it appears in a container definition.

              (structure)
                 The load balancer configuration to use with a service or task
                 set.

                 For specific notes and restrictions regarding the use of load
                 balancers with services and task sets, see the  CreateService
                 and CreateTaskSet actions.

                 When  you  add,  update, or remove a load blaancer configura-
                 tion, Amazon ECS starts a new  deployment  with  the  updated
                 Elastic  Load  Balancing  configuration. This causes tasks to
                 register to and deregister from load balancers.

                 We recommend that you verify this on a test  environment  be-
                 fore you update the Elastic Load Balancing configuration.

                 A  service-linked role is required for services that use mul-
                 tiple target groups. For more information, see Service-linked
                 roles in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide
                 .

                 targetGroupArn -> (string)
                     The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  Elastic  Load
                     Balancing  target  group or groups associated with a ser-
                     vice or task set.

                     A target group ARN is only specified when using an Appli-
                     cation  Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. If you're
                     using a Classic Load Balancer, omit the target group ARN.

                     For services using the ECS deployment controller, you can
                     specify  one or multiple target groups. For more informa-
                     tion, see Registering Multiple Target Groups with a  Ser-
                     vice  in  the  Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer
                     Guide .

                     For services using the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller,
                     you're  required to define two target groups for the load
                     balancer. For more information, see Blue/Green Deployment
                     with  CodeDeploy  in the Amazon Elastic Container Service
                     Developer Guide .

                     WARNING:
                        If your service's task definition uses the awsvpc net-
                        work  mode, you must choose ip as the target type, not
                        instance . Do this when creating  your  target  groups
                        because tasks that use the awsvpc network mode are as-
                        sociated with an elastic  network  interface,  not  an
                        Amazon EC2 instance. This network mode is required for
                        the Fargate launch type.

                 loadBalancerName -> (string)
                     The name of the load balancer to associate with the  Ama-
                     zon ECS service or task set.

                     A load balancer name is only specified when using a Clas-
                     sic Load Balancer. If you are using an  Application  Load
                     Balancer  or  a  Network  Load Balancer the load balancer
                     name parameter should be omitted.

                 containerName -> (string)
                     The name of the container (as it appears in  a  container
                     definition) to associate with the load balancer.

                 containerPort -> (integer)
                     The port on the container to associate with the load bal-
                     ancer. This port must correspond to  a  containerPort  in
                     the  task  definition the tasks in the service are using.
                     For tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the container in-
                     stance  they're launched on must allow ingress traffic on
                     the hostPort of the port mapping.

          serviceRegistries -> (list)
              The details for the service discovery registries  to  assign  to
              this service. For more information, see Service Discovery .

              (structure)
                 The details for the service registry.

                 Each  service  may  be  associated with one service registry.
                 Multiple service registries for each  service  are  not  sup-
                 ported.

                 When  you  add, update, or remove the service registries con-
                 figuration, Amazon ECS starts a new deployment. New tasks are
                 registered  and  deregistered to the updated service registry
                 configuration.

                 registryArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  service  registry.
                     The  currently  supported  service registry is Cloud Map.
                     For more information, see CreateService .

                 port -> (integer)
                     The port value used if  your  service  discovery  service
                     specified an SRV record. This field might be used if both
                     the awsvpc network mode and SRV records are used.

                 containerName -> (string)
                     The container name value to be used for your service dis-
                     covery  service. It's already specified in the task defi-
                     nition. If the task definition  that  your  service  task
                     specifies  uses the bridge or host network mode, you must
                     specify a  containerName  and  containerPort  combination
                     from  the  task  definition.  If the task definition that
                     your service task specifies uses the awsvpc network  mode
                     and  a  type SRV DNS record is used, you must specify ei-
                     ther a containerName and containerPort combination  or  a
                     port value. However, you can't specify both.

                 containerPort -> (integer)
                     The port value to be used for your service discovery ser-
                     vice. It's already specified in the task  definition.  If
                     the  task definition your service task specifies uses the
                     bridge or host network mode, you must specify a  contain-
                     erName  and containerPort combination from the task defi-
                     nition. If the task definition your service  task  speci-
                     fies  uses  the  awsvpc  network  mode and a type SRV DNS
                     record is used, you must specify either  a  containerName
                     and  containerPort  combination or a port value. However,
                     you can't specify both.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the service. The valid values are ACTIVE ,  DRAIN-
              ING , or INACTIVE .

          desiredCount -> (integer)
              The  desired  number of instantiations of the task definition to
              keep running on the service. This value is  specified  when  the
              service  is created with  CreateService , and it can be modified
              with  UpdateService .

          runningCount -> (integer)
              The number of tasks in the  cluster  that  are  in  the  RUNNING
              state.

          pendingCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of  tasks  in  the  cluster that are in the PENDING
              state.

          launchType -> (string)
              The launch type  the  service  is  using.  When  using  the  De-
              scribeServices  API,  this  field  is omitted if the service was
              created using a capacity provider strategy.

          capacityProviderStrategy -> (list)
              The capacity provider strategy the service uses. When using  the
              DescribeServices  API,  this field is omitted if the service was
              created using a launch type.

              (structure)
                 The details of  a  capacity  provider  strategy.  A  capacity
                 provider strategy can be set when using the  RunTask or  Cre-
                 ateCluster APIs or as the default capacity provider  strategy
                 for a cluster with the  CreateCluster API.

                 Only  capacity  providers  that are already associated with a
                 cluster and have an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used  in
                 a   capacity   provider   strategy.   The   PutClusterCapaci-
                 tyProviders API is used to associate a capacity provider with
                 a cluster.

                 If  specifying  a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling
                 group, the capacity provider must  already  be  created.  New
                 Auto Scaling group capacity providers can be created with the
                 CreateCapacityProvider API operation.

                 To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either  the  FAR-
                 GATE or FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers. The Fargate capacity
                 providers are available to all accounts and only need  to  be
                 associated  with  a cluster to be used in a capacity provider
                 strategy.

                 A capacity provider strategy may contain a maximum of  6  ca-
                 pacity providers.

                 capacityProvider -> (string)
                     The short name of the capacity provider.

                 weight -> (integer)
                     The  weight  value  designates the relative percentage of
                     the total number of tasks launched that  should  use  the
                     specified  capacity  provider.  The weight value is taken
                     into consideration after the base value, if  defined,  is
                     satisfied.

                     If  no  weight value is specified, the default value of 0
                     is used. When multiple capacity providers  are  specified
                     within  a capacity provider strategy, at least one of the
                     capacity providers must have a weight value greater  than
                     zero  and any capacity providers with a weight of 0 can't
                     be used to place tasks. If you specify multiple  capacity
                     providers in a strategy that all have a weight of 0 , any
                     RunTask  or  CreateService  actions  using  the  capacity
                     provider strategy will fail.

                     An  example  scenario  for  using  weights  is defining a
                     strategy that contains two capacity  providers  and  both
                     have a weight of 1 , then when the base is satisfied, the
                     tasks will  be  split  evenly  across  the  two  capacity
                     providers. Using that same logic, if you specify a weight
                     of 1 for capacityProviderA and a weight of 4 for  capaci-
                     tyProviderB  ,  then  for every one task that's run using
                     capacityProviderA  ,  four  tasks   would   use   capaci-
                     tyProviderB .

                 base -> (integer)
                     The  base  value designates how many tasks, at a minimum,
                     to run on the specified capacity provider. Only  one  ca-
                     pacity  provider in a capacity provider strategy can have
                     a base defined. If no value  is  specified,  the  default
                     value of 0 is used.

          platformVersion -> (string)
              The  platform version to run your service on. A platform version
              is only specified for tasks that are hosted on Fargate.  If  one
              isn't  specified,  the LATEST platform version is used. For more
              information, see Fargate Platform Versions in the Amazon Elastic
              Container Service Developer Guide .

          platformFamily -> (string)
              The  operating  system  that your tasks in the service run on. A
              platform family is specified only for tasks  using  the  Fargate
              launch type.

              All  tasks  that  run  as part of this service must use the same
              platformFamily value as the service (for example, LINUX ).

          taskDefinition -> (string)
              The task definition to use for tasks in the service. This  value
              is  specified  when the service is created with  CreateService ,
              and it can be modified with  UpdateService .

          deploymentConfiguration -> (structure)
              Optional deployment parameters that control how many  tasks  run
              during  the deployment and the ordering of stopping and starting
              tasks.

              deploymentCircuitBreaker -> (structure)

                 NOTE:
                     The deployment circuit breaker can only be used for  ser-
                     vices using the rolling update (ECS ) deployment type.

                 The  deployment  circuit breaker determines whether a service
                 deployment will fail if the  service  can't  reach  a  steady
                 state.  If  deployment  circuit breaker is enabled, a service
                 deployment will transition to a failed state and stop launch-
                 ing new tasks. If rollback is enabled, when a service deploy-
                 ment fails, the service is rolled back to the last deployment
                 that completed successfully.

                 enable -> (boolean)
                     Determines  whether to use the deployment circuit breaker
                     logic for the service.

                 rollback -> (boolean)
                     Determines whether to configure Amazon ECS to  roll  back
                     the service if a service deployment fails. If rollback is
                     enabled, when a service deployment fails, the service  is
                     rolled  back  to  the last deployment that completed suc-
                     cessfully.

              maximumPercent -> (integer)
                 If a service is using the rolling update  (ECS  )  deployment
                 type, the maximum percent parameter represents an upper limit
                 on the number of tasks in a service that are allowed  in  the
                 RUNNING or PENDING state during a deployment, as a percentage
                 of the desired number of tasks (rounded down to  the  nearest
                 integer), and while any container instances are in the DRAIN-
                 ING state if the service contains tasks using the EC2  launch
                 type.  This  parameter  enables  you to define the deployment
                 batch size. For example, if your service has a desired number
                 of four tasks and a maximum percent value of 200%, the sched-
                 uler may start four new tasks before stopping the four  older
                 tasks  (provided  that  the  cluster resources required to do
                 this are available). The default value for maximum percent is
                 200%.

                 If a service is using the blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY ) or EXTER-
                 NAL deployment types and tasks that use the EC2 launch  type,
                 the  maximum percent value is set to the default value and is
                 used to define the upper limit on the number of the tasks  in
                 the  service  that remain in the RUNNING state while the con-
                 tainer instances are in the DRAINING state. If the  tasks  in
                 the  service use the Fargate launch type, the maximum percent
                 value is not used, although it is  returned  when  describing
                 your service.

              minimumHealthyPercent -> (integer)
                 If  a  service  is using the rolling update (ECS ) deployment
                 type, the minimum healthy percent represents a lower limit on
                 the number of tasks in a service that must remain in the RUN-
                 NING state during a deployment, as a percentage  of  the  de-
                 sired  number  of  tasks (rounded up to the nearest integer),
                 and while any container instances are in the  DRAINING  state
                 if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This
                 parameter enables you  to  deploy  without  using  additional
                 cluster  capacity. For example, if your service has a desired
                 number of four tasks and a minimum healthy  percent  of  50%,
                 the  scheduler may stop two existing tasks to free up cluster
                 capacity before starting two new tasks.  Tasks  for  services
                 that  do  not  use  a load balancer are considered healthy if
                 they're in the RUNNING state; tasks for services that do  use
                 a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUN-
                 NING state and they're reported as healthy by the  load  bal-
                 ancer. The default value for minimum healthy percent is 100%.

                 If a service is using the blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY ) or EXTER-
                 NAL deployment types and tasks that use the EC2 launch  type,
                 the minimum healthy percent value is set to the default value
                 and is used to define the lower limit on the  number  of  the
                 tasks  in  the service that remain in the RUNNING state while
                 the container instances are in the  DRAINING  state.  If  the
                 tasks in the service use the Fargate launch type, the minimum
                 healthy percent value is not used, although  it  is  returned
                 when describing your service.

          taskSets -> (list)
              Information about a set of Amazon ECS tasks in either an CodeDe-
              ploy or an EXTERNAL deployment. An Amazon ECS task set  includes
              details  such as the desired number of tasks, how many tasks are
              running, and whether the task set serves production traffic.

              (structure)
                 Information about a set of Amazon ECS tasks in either an Cod-
                 eDeploy or an EXTERNAL deployment. An Amazon ECS task set in-
                 cludes details such as the desired number of tasks, how  many
                 tasks are running, and whether the task set serves production
                 traffic.

                 id -> (string)
                     The ID of the task set.

                 taskSetArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task set.

                 serviceArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  service  the  task
                     set exists in.

                 clusterArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the cluster that the
                     service that hosts the task set exists in.

                 startedBy -> (string)
                     The tag specified when a task set is started. If an  Cod-
                     eDeploy  deployment  created  the task set, the startedBy
                     parameter is CODE_DEPLOY . If an external deployment cre-
                     ated the task set, the startedBy field isn't used.

                 externalId -> (string)
                     The external ID associated with the task set.

                     If  an  CodeDeploy deployment created a task set, the ex-
                     ternalId parameter contains the CodeDeploy deployment ID.

                     If a task set is created for an external  deployment  and
                     is  associated with a service discovery registry, the ex-
                     ternalId parameter contains the  ECS_TASK_SET_EXTERNAL_ID
                     Cloud Map attribute.

                 status -> (string)
                     The  status of the task set. The following describes each
                     state.
                        PRIMARY

                     The task set is serving production traffic.
                        ACTIVE

                     The task set isn't serving production traffic.
                        DRAINING

                     The tasks in the task set are being  stopped,  and  their
                     corresponding  targets  are being deregistered from their
                     target group.

                 taskDefinition -> (string)
                     The task definition that the task set is using.

                 computedDesiredCount -> (integer)
                     The computed desired count for the task set. This is cal-
                     culated  by multiplying the service's desiredCount by the
                     task set's scale percentage. The result is always rounded
                     up. For example, if the computed desired count is 1.2, it
                     rounds up to 2 tasks.

                 pendingCount -> (integer)
                     The number of tasks in the task set that are in the PEND-
                     ING  status  during  a  deployment. A task in the PENDING
                     state is preparing to enter the RUNNING state. A task set
                     enters  the PENDING status when it launches for the first
                     time or when it's restarted after being  in  the  STOPPED
                     state.

                 runningCount -> (integer)
                     The  number of tasks in the task set that are in the RUN-
                     NING status during a deployment. A task  in  the  RUNNING
                     state is running and ready for use.

                 createdAt -> (timestamp)
                     The  Unix  timestamp  for  the time when the task set was
                     created.

                 updatedAt -> (timestamp)
                     The Unix timestamp for the time when  the  task  set  was
                     last updated.

                 launchType -> (string)
                     The  launch type the tasks in the task set are using. For
                     more information, see Amazon ECS launch types in the Ama-
                     zon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                 capacityProviderStrategy -> (list)
                     The  capacity  provider strategy that are associated with
                     the task set.

                     (structure)
                        The details of a capacity provider strategy. A  capac-
                        ity  provider strategy can be set when using the  Run-
                        Task or  CreateCluster APIs or as the default capacity
                        provider  strategy for a cluster with the  CreateClus-
                        ter API.

                        Only capacity providers that  are  already  associated
                        with  a  cluster and have an ACTIVE or UPDATING status
                        can be used in a capacity provider strategy. The  Put-
                        ClusterCapacityProviders  API  is  used to associate a
                        capacity provider with a cluster.

                        If specifying a capacity provider that  uses  an  Auto
                        Scaling  group,  the capacity provider must already be
                        created. New Auto Scaling group capacity providers can
                        be created with the  CreateCapacityProvider API opera-
                        tion.

                        To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either the
                        FARGATE  or  FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers. The Far-
                        gate capacity providers are available to all  accounts
                        and  only  need  to be associated with a cluster to be
                        used in a capacity provider strategy.

                        A capacity provider strategy may contain a maximum  of
                        6 capacity providers.

                        capacityProvider -> (string)
                            The short name of the capacity provider.

                        weight -> (integer)
                            The  weight value designates the relative percent-
                            age of the total number  of  tasks  launched  that
                            should  use  the  specified capacity provider. The
                            weight value is taken into consideration after the
                            base value, if defined, is satisfied.

                            If no weight value is specified, the default value
                            of 0 is used. When multiple capacity providers are
                            specified  within a capacity provider strategy, at
                            least one of the capacity providers  must  have  a
                            weight  value  greater  than zero and any capacity
                            providers with a weight of  0  can't  be  used  to
                            place  tasks.  If  you  specify  multiple capacity
                            providers in a strategy that all have a weight  of
                            0 , any RunTask or CreateService actions using the
                            capacity provider strategy will fail.

                            An example scenario for using weights is  defining
                            a  strategy  that  contains two capacity providers
                            and both have a weight of 1 , then when  the  base
                            is  satisfied,  the  tasks  will  be  split evenly
                            across the two capacity providers. Using that same
                            logic,  if  you  specify a weight of 1 for capaci-
                            tyProviderA  and  a  weight  of  4   for   capaci-
                            tyProviderB  ,  then for every one task that's run
                            using capacityProviderA , four tasks would use ca-
                            pacityProviderB .

                        base -> (integer)
                            The  base  value  designates  how many tasks, at a
                            minimum,  to  run  on   the   specified   capacity
                            provider. Only one capacity provider in a capacity
                            provider strategy can have a base defined.  If  no
                            value  is  specified,  the  default  value of 0 is
                            used.

                 platformVersion -> (string)
                     The Fargate platform version where the tasks in the  task
                     set are running. A platform version is only specified for
                     tasks run on Fargate. For more information,  see  Fargate
                     platform versions in the Amazon Elastic Container Service
                     Developer Guide .

                 platformFamily -> (string)
                     The operating system that your tasks in the set are  run-
                     ning  on.  A  platform family is specified only for tasks
                     that use the Fargate launch type.

                     All tasks in the set must have the same value.

                 networkConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The network configuration for the task set.

                     awsvpcConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The VPC subnets and security groups that  are  associ-
                        ated with a task.

                        NOTE:
                            All  specified subnets and security groups must be
                            from the same VPC.

                        subnets -> (list)
                            The IDs of the subnets associated with the task or
                            service. There's a limit of 16 subnets that can be
                            specified per AwsVpcConfiguration .

                            NOTE:
                               All specified subnets must  be  from  the  same
                               VPC.

                            (string)

                        securityGroups -> (list)
                            The IDs of the security groups associated with the
                            task or service. If you don't specify  a  security
                            group,  the  default security group for the VPC is
                            used. There's a limit of 5  security  groups  that
                            can be specified per AwsVpcConfiguration .

                            NOTE:
                               All  specified security groups must be from the
                               same VPC.

                            (string)

                        assignPublicIp -> (string)
                            Whether the task's elastic network  interface  re-
                            ceives  a  public IP address. The default value is
                            DISABLED .

                 loadBalancers -> (list)
                     Details on a load balancer that are used with a task set.

                     (structure)
                        The load balancer configuration to use with a  service
                        or task set.

                        For  specific notes and restrictions regarding the use
                        of load balancers with services and task sets, see the
                        CreateService and CreateTaskSet actions.

                        When  you  add, update, or remove a load blaancer con-
                        figuration, Amazon ECS starts a  new  deployment  with
                        the updated Elastic Load Balancing configuration. This
                        causes tasks to register to and deregister  from  load
                        balancers.

                        We  recommend  that you verify this on a test environ-
                        ment before you update the Elastic Load Balancing con-
                        figuration.

                        A  service-linked  role  is required for services that
                        use multiple target groups. For more information,  see
                        Service-linked  roles  in the Amazon Elastic Container
                        Service Developer Guide .

                        targetGroupArn -> (string)
                            The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Elastic
                            Load  Balancing  target group or groups associated
                            with a service or task set.

                            A target group ARN is only specified when using an
                            Application  Load  Balancer  or  Network Load Bal-
                            ancer. If you're using a  Classic  Load  Balancer,
                            omit the target group ARN.

                            For  services using the ECS deployment controller,
                            you can specify one or multiple target groups. For
                            more  information, see Registering Multiple Target
                            Groups with a Service in the Amazon  Elastic  Con-
                            tainer Service Developer Guide .

                            For services using the CODE_DEPLOY deployment con-
                            troller, you're  required  to  define  two  target
                            groups  for  the  load balancer. For more informa-
                            tion, see Blue/Green Deployment with CodeDeploy in
                            the  Amazon  Elastic  Container  Service Developer
                            Guide .

                            WARNING:
                               If your  service's  task  definition  uses  the
                               awsvpc  network mode, you must choose ip as the
                               target type, not instance . Do this when creat-
                               ing  your  target groups because tasks that use
                               the awsvpc network mode are associated with  an
                               elastic  network  interface,  not an Amazon EC2
                               instance. This network mode is required for the
                               Fargate launch type.

                        loadBalancerName -> (string)
                            The  name  of  the load balancer to associate with
                            the Amazon ECS service or task set.

                            A load balancer name is only specified when  using
                            a  Classic  Load Balancer. If you are using an Ap-
                            plication Load Balancer or a Network Load Balancer
                            the  load  balancer name parameter should be omit-
                            ted.

                        containerName -> (string)
                            The name of the container (as it appears in a con-
                            tainer definition) to associate with the load bal-
                            ancer.

                        containerPort -> (integer)
                            The port on the container to  associate  with  the
                            load balancer. This port must correspond to a con-
                            tainerPort in the task definition the tasks in the
                            service  are  using.  For  tasks  that use the EC2
                            launch  type,  the  container   instance   they're
                            launched  on  must  allow  ingress  traffic on the
                            hostPort of the port mapping.

                 serviceRegistries -> (list)
                     The details for the service discovery registries  to  as-
                     sign  to this task set. For more information, see Service
                     discovery .

                     (structure)
                        The details for the service registry.

                        Each service may be associated with one  service  reg-
                        istry.  Multiple  service  registries for each service
                        are not supported.

                        When you add, update, or remove the service registries
                        configuration, Amazon ECS starts a new deployment. New
                        tasks are registered and deregistered to  the  updated
                        service registry configuration.

                        registryArn -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service reg-
                            istry. The currently supported service registry is
                            Cloud Map. For more information, see CreateService
                            .

                        port -> (integer)
                            The port value used if your service discovery ser-
                            vice  specified an SRV record. This field might be
                            used if both  the  awsvpc  network  mode  and  SRV
                            records are used.

                        containerName -> (string)
                            The  container name value to be used for your ser-
                            vice discovery service. It's already specified  in
                            the  task  definition. If the task definition that
                            your service task specifies  uses  the  bridge  or
                            host  network  mode, you must specify a container-
                            Name and containerPort combination from  the  task
                            definition.  If the task definition that your ser-
                            vice task specifies uses the awsvpc  network  mode
                            and  a type SRV DNS record is used, you must spec-
                            ify either a containerName and containerPort  com-
                            bination or a port value. However, you can't spec-
                            ify both.

                        containerPort -> (integer)
                            The port value to be used for your service discov-
                            ery  service.  It's  already specified in the task
                            definition. If the task  definition  your  service
                            task  specifies  uses  the  bridge or host network
                            mode, you must specify a  containerName  and  con-
                            tainerPort  combination  from the task definition.
                            If the task definition your service task specifies
                            uses  the  awsvpc  network mode and a type SRV DNS
                            record is used, you must specify either a contain-
                            erName  and  containerPort  combination  or a port
                            value. However, you can't specify both.

                 scale -> (structure)
                     A floating-point percentage of  your  desired  number  of
                     tasks to place and keep running in the task set.

                     value -> (double)
                        The value, specified as a percent total of a service's
                        desiredCount , to scale the task set. Accepted  values
                        are numbers between 0 and 100.

                     unit -> (string)
                        The unit of measure for the scale value.

                 stabilityStatus -> (string)
                     The stability status. This indicates whether the task set
                     has reached a steady state. If the  following  conditions
                     are met, the task set sre in STEADY_STATE :

                     o The  task runningCount is equal to the computedDesired-
                       Count .

                     o The pendingCount is 0 .

                     o There are no tasks that are running  on  container  in-
                       stances in the DRAINING status.

                     o All  tasks are reporting a healthy status from the load
                       balancers,  service  discovery,  and  container  health
                       checks.

                     If any of those conditions aren't met, the stability sta-
                     tus returns STABILIZING .

                 stabilityStatusAt -> (timestamp)
                     The Unix timestamp for the time when the task set stabil-
                     ity status was retrieved.

                 tags -> (list)
                     The  metadata  that you apply to the task set to help you
                     categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a  key
                     and an optional value. You define both.

                     The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                     o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                     o For  each  resource,  each  tag key must be unique, and
                       each tag key can have only one value.

                     o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                     o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                     o If your tagging schema is used across multiple services
                       and  resources,  remember  that other services may have
                       restrictions on allowed characters.  Generally  allowed
                       characters  are:  letters,  numbers,  and spaces repre-
                       sentable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + -  =
                       . _ : / @.

                     o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                     o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase com-
                       bination of such as a prefix for either keys or  values
                       as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You can-
                       not edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix.
                       Tags  with  this  prefix do not count against your tags
                       per resource limit.

                     (structure)
                        The metadata that you apply to a resource to help  you
                        categorize  and  organize them. Each tag consists of a
                        key and an optional value. You define them.

                        The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                        o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                        o For each resource, each tag key must be unique,  and
                          each tag key can have only one value.

                        o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                        o Maximum  value  length  -  256 Unicode characters in
                          UTF-8

                        o If your tagging schema is used across multiple  ser-
                          vices  and  resources,  remember that other services
                          may have restrictions on allowed characters.  Gener-
                          ally  allowed  characters are: letters, numbers, and
                          spaces representable in  UTF-8,  and  the  following
                          characters: + - = . _ : / @.

                        o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                        o Do  not  use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase
                          combination of such as a prefix for either  keys  or
                          values  as  it  is  reserved for Amazon Web Services
                          use. You cannot edit or delete tag  keys  or  values
                          with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count
                          against your tags per resource limit.

                        key -> (string)
                            One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A
                            key  is  a general label that acts like a category
                            for more specific tag values.

                        value -> (string)
                            The optional part of a key-value pair that make up
                            a  tag.  A value acts as a descriptor within a tag
                            category (key).

          deployments -> (list)
              The current state of deployments for the service.

              (structure)
                 The details of an Amazon ECS service deployment. This is used
                 only when a service uses the ECS deployment controller type.

                 id -> (string)
                     The ID of the deployment.

                 status -> (string)
                     The  status  of  the  deployment. The following describes
                     each state.
                        PRIMARY

                     The most recent deployment of a service.
                        ACTIVE

                     A service deployment that still has  running  tasks,  but
                     are  in  the process of being replaced with a new PRIMARY
                     deployment.
                        INACTIVE

                     A deployment that has been completely replaced.

                 taskDefinition -> (string)
                     The most recent task definition that  was  specified  for
                     the tasks in the service to use.

                 desiredCount -> (integer)
                     The most recent desired count of tasks that was specified
                     for the service to deploy or maintain.

                 pendingCount -> (integer)
                     The number of tasks in the deployment  that  are  in  the
                     PENDING status.

                 runningCount -> (integer)
                     The  number  of  tasks  in the deployment that are in the
                     RUNNING status.

                 failedTasks -> (integer)
                     The number of consecutively failed tasks in  the  deploy-
                     ment.  A  task  is  considered  a  failure if the service
                     scheduler can't launch the task, the task doesn't transi-
                     tion  to  a  RUNNING state, or if it fails any of its de-
                     fined health checks and is stopped.

                     NOTE:
                        Once a service deployment has one or more successfully
                        running  tasks,  the  failed task count resets to zero
                        and stops being evaluated.

                 createdAt -> (timestamp)
                     The Unix timestamp for the time when the service  deploy-
                     ment was created.

                 updatedAt -> (timestamp)
                     The  Unix timestamp for the time when the service deploy-
                     ment was last updated.

                 capacityProviderStrategy -> (list)
                     The capacity provider strategy that the deployment is us-
                     ing.

                     (structure)
                        The  details of a capacity provider strategy. A capac-
                        ity provider strategy can be set when using the   Run-
                        Task or  CreateCluster APIs or as the default capacity
                        provider strategy for a cluster with the   CreateClus-
                        ter API.

                        Only  capacity  providers  that are already associated
                        with a cluster and have an ACTIVE or  UPDATING  status
                        can be used in a capacity provider strategy. The  Put-
                        ClusterCapacityProviders API is used  to  associate  a
                        capacity provider with a cluster.

                        If  specifying  a  capacity provider that uses an Auto
                        Scaling group, the capacity provider must  already  be
                        created. New Auto Scaling group capacity providers can
                        be created with the  CreateCapacityProvider API opera-
                        tion.

                        To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either the
                        FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers.  The  Far-
                        gate  capacity providers are available to all accounts
                        and only need to be associated with a  cluster  to  be
                        used in a capacity provider strategy.

                        A  capacity provider strategy may contain a maximum of
                        6 capacity providers.

                        capacityProvider -> (string)
                            The short name of the capacity provider.

                        weight -> (integer)
                            The weight value designates the relative  percent-
                            age  of  the  total  number of tasks launched that
                            should use the specified  capacity  provider.  The
                            weight value is taken into consideration after the
                            base value, if defined, is satisfied.

                            If no weight value is specified, the default value
                            of 0 is used. When multiple capacity providers are
                            specified within a capacity provider strategy,  at
                            least  one  of  the capacity providers must have a
                            weight value greater than zero  and  any  capacity
                            providers  with  a  weight  of  0 can't be used to
                            place tasks.  If  you  specify  multiple  capacity
                            providers  in a strategy that all have a weight of
                            0 , any RunTask or CreateService actions using the
                            capacity provider strategy will fail.

                            An  example scenario for using weights is defining
                            a strategy that contains  two  capacity  providers
                            and  both  have a weight of 1 , then when the base
                            is satisfied,  the  tasks  will  be  split  evenly
                            across the two capacity providers. Using that same
                            logic, if you specify a weight of  1  for  capaci-
                            tyProviderA   and   a  weight  of  4  for  capaci-
                            tyProviderB , then for every one task  that's  run
                            using capacityProviderA , four tasks would use ca-
                            pacityProviderB .

                        base -> (integer)
                            The base value designates how  many  tasks,  at  a
                            minimum,   to   run   on  the  specified  capacity
                            provider. Only one capacity provider in a capacity
                            provider  strategy  can have a base defined. If no
                            value is specified, the  default  value  of  0  is
                            used.

                 launchType -> (string)
                     The  launch  type the tasks in the service are using. For
                     more information, see Amazon ECS Launch Types in the Ama-
                     zon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                 platformVersion -> (string)
                     The  platform  version that your tasks in the service run
                     on. A platform version is only specified for tasks  using
                     the Fargate launch type. If one isn't specified, the LAT-
                     EST platform version is used. For more  information,  see
                     Fargate Platform Versions in the Amazon Elastic Container
                     Service Developer Guide .

                 platformFamily -> (string)
                     The operating system that your tasks in the  service,  or
                     tasks are running on. A platform family is specified only
                     for tasks using the Fargate launch type.

                     All tasks that run as part of this service must  use  the
                     same  platformFamily  value  as the service, for example,
                     LINUX. .

                 networkConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The VPC subnet and security group configuration for tasks
                     that receive their own elastic network interface by using
                     the awsvpc networking mode.

                     awsvpcConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The VPC subnets and security groups that  are  associ-
                        ated with a task.

                        NOTE:
                            All  specified subnets and security groups must be
                            from the same VPC.

                        subnets -> (list)
                            The IDs of the subnets associated with the task or
                            service. There's a limit of 16 subnets that can be
                            specified per AwsVpcConfiguration .

                            NOTE:
                               All specified subnets must  be  from  the  same
                               VPC.

                            (string)

                        securityGroups -> (list)
                            The IDs of the security groups associated with the
                            task or service. If you don't specify  a  security
                            group,  the  default security group for the VPC is
                            used. There's a limit of 5  security  groups  that
                            can be specified per AwsVpcConfiguration .

                            NOTE:
                               All  specified security groups must be from the
                               same VPC.

                            (string)

                        assignPublicIp -> (string)
                            Whether the task's elastic network  interface  re-
                            ceives  a  public IP address. The default value is
                            DISABLED .

                 rolloutState -> (string)

                     NOTE:
                        The rolloutState of a service  is  only  returned  for
                        services that use the rolling update (ECS ) deployment
                        type that aren't behind a Classic Load Balancer.

                     The rollout state of the deployment. When a  service  de-
                     ployment  is  started, it begins in an IN_PROGRESS state.
                     When the service reaches a steady state,  the  deployment
                     transitions to a COMPLETED state. If the service fails to
                     reach a steady state and circuit breaker is enabled,  the
                     deployment transitions to a FAILED state. A deployment in
                     FAILED state doesn't launch any new tasks. For  more  in-
                     formation, see  DeploymentCircuitBreaker .

                 rolloutStateReason -> (string)
                     A description of the rollout state of a deployment.

          roleArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  of the IAM role that's associated with the service. It
              allows the Amazon ECS container agent to register container  in-
              stances with an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer.

          events -> (list)
              The  event stream for your service. A maximum of 100 of the lat-
              est events are displayed.

              (structure)
                 The details for an event that's associated with a service.

                 id -> (string)
                     The ID string for the event.

                 createdAt -> (timestamp)
                     The Unix timestamp for the time when the event was  trig-
                     gered.

                 message -> (string)
                     The event message.

          createdAt -> (timestamp)
              The Unix timestamp for the time when the service was created.

          placementConstraints -> (list)
              The placement constraints for the tasks in the service.

              (structure)
                 An  object  representing  a constraint on task placement. For
                 more information, see Task Placement Constraints in the  Ama-
                 zon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                 NOTE:
                     If  you're  using the Fargate launch type, task placement
                     constraints aren't supported.

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of constraint. Use  distinctInstance  to  ensure
                     that each task in a particular group is running on a dif-
                     ferent container instance. Use memberOf to  restrict  the
                     selection to a group of valid candidates.

                 expression -> (string)
                     A  cluster query language expression to apply to the con-
                     straint. The expression can have a maximum length of 2000
                     characters.  You  can't specify an expression if the con-
                     straint type is distinctInstance . For more  information,
                     see  Cluster  query  language  in the Amazon Elastic Con-
                     tainer Service Developer Guide .

          placementStrategy -> (list)
              The placement strategy that determines how tasks for the service
              are placed.

              (structure)
                 The  task  placement strategy for a task or service. For more
                 information, see Task  Placement  Strategies  in  the  Amazon
                 Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                 type -> (string)
                     The  type  of  placement  strategy.  The random placement
                     strategy randomly places tasks on  available  candidates.
                     The  spread  placement  strategy spreads placement across
                     available candidates evenly based on the field parameter.
                     The binpack strategy places tasks on available candidates
                     that have the least  available  amount  of  the  resource
                     that's  specified  with the field parameter. For example,
                     if you binpack on memory, a task is  placed  on  the  in-
                     stance  with  the  least  amount  of remaining memory but
                     still enough to run the task.

                 field -> (string)
                     The field to apply the placement  strategy  against.  For
                     the  spread  placement strategy, valid values are instan-
                     ceId (or host , which has the same effect), or any  plat-
                     form  or  custom  attribute that's applied to a container
                     instance, such as attribute:ecs.availability-zone  .  For
                     the  binpack placement strategy, valid values are cpu and
                     memory . For the random placement strategy, this field is
                     not used.

          networkConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  VPC  subnet and security group configuration for tasks that
              receive their own elastic network interface by using the  awsvpc
              networking mode.

              awsvpcConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The  VPC subnets and security groups that are associated with
                 a task.

                 NOTE:
                     All specified subnets and security groups  must  be  from
                     the same VPC.

                 subnets -> (list)
                     The  IDs  of the subnets associated with the task or ser-
                     vice. There's a limit of 16 subnets that can be specified
                     per AwsVpcConfiguration .

                     NOTE:
                        All specified subnets must be from the same VPC.

                     (string)

                 securityGroups -> (list)
                     The  IDs  of the security groups associated with the task
                     or service. If you don't specify a  security  group,  the
                     default  security  group  for  the VPC is used. There's a
                     limit of 5 security groups  that  can  be  specified  per
                     AwsVpcConfiguration .

                     NOTE:
                        All  specified  security  groups must be from the same
                        VPC.

                     (string)

                 assignPublicIp -> (string)
                     Whether the task's elastic network interface  receives  a
                     public IP address. The default value is DISABLED .

          healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds -> (integer)
              The  period  of  time,  in  seconds, that the Amazon ECS service
              scheduler ignores unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing target health
              checks after a task has first started.

          schedulingStrategy -> (string)
              The  scheduling strategy to use for the service. For more infor-
              mation, see Services .

              There are two service scheduler strategies available.

              o REPLICA -The replica scheduling strategy places and  maintains
                the  desired  number of tasks across your cluster. By default,
                the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones.
                You  can use task placement strategies and constraints to cus-
                tomize task placement decisions.

              o DAEMON -The daemon scheduling  strategy  deploys  exactly  one
                task on each active container instance. This task meets all of
                the task placement constraints that you specify in your  clus-
                ter.  The  service scheduler also evaluates the task placement
                constraints for running tasks. It stop tasks that  don't  meet
                the placement constraints.

              NOTE:
                 Fargate tasks don't support the DAEMON scheduling strategy.

          deploymentController -> (structure)
              The  deployment controller type the service is using. When using
              the DescribeServices API, this field is omitted if  the  service
              uses the ECS deployment controller type.

              type -> (string)
                 The deployment controller type to use.

                 There are three deployment controller types available:
                     ECS

                 The  rolling update (ECS ) deployment type involves replacing
                 the current running version of the container with the  latest
                 version.  The number of containers Amazon ECS adds or removes
                 from the service during a rolling update is controlled by ad-
                 justing  the  minimum and maximum number of healthy tasks al-
                 lowed during a service deployment, as specified in  the   De-
                 ploymentConfiguration .
                     CODE_DEPLOY

                 The  blue/green  (CODE_DEPLOY  )  deployment  type  uses  the
                 blue/green deployment model powered by CodeDeploy, which  al-
                 lows you to verify a new deployment of a service before send-
                 ing production traffic to it.
                     EXTERNAL

                 The external (EXTERNAL ) deployment type enables you  to  use
                 any  third-party  deployment controller for full control over
                 the deployment process for an Amazon ECS service.

          tags -> (list)
              The metadata that you apply to the service to help  you  catego-
              rize  and  organize  them. Each tag consists of a key and an op-
              tional value. You define bot the key and value.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

              o For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and  each  tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o If  your  tagging  schema is used across multiple services and
                resources, remember that other services may have  restrictions
                on  allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
                lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.

              o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

              o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination
                of such as a prefix for either keys or values  as  it  is  re-
                served  for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete
                tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix  do
                not count against your tags per resource limit.

              (structure)
                 The metadata that you apply to a resource to help you catego-
                 rize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an op-
                 tional value. You define them.

                   tions on allowed characters. Generally  allowed  characters
                   are:  letters,  numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8,
                   and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.

                 o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combina-
                   tion of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is
                   reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You  cannot  edit  or
                   delete  tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this
                   prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.

                 key -> (string)
                     One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is
                     a  general  label that acts like a category for more spe-
                     cific tag values.

                 value -> (string)
                     The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a tag.
                     A value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

          createdBy -> (string)
              The principal that created the service.

          enableECSManagedTags -> (boolean)
              Determines  whether to use Amazon ECS managed tags for the tasks
              in the service. For more information, see  Tagging  Your  Amazon
              ECS  Resources in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer
              Guide .

          propagateTags -> (string)
              Determines whether to propagate the tags from the  task  defini-
              tion  or  the service to the task. If no value is specified, the
              tags aren't propagated.

          enableExecuteCommand -> (boolean)
              Determines whether the execute command functionality is  enabled
              for  the service. If true , the execute command functionality is
              enabled for all containers in tasks as part of the service.
