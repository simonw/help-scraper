DESCRIPTION
       WARNING:
          Updating  the task placement strategies and constraints on an Amazon
          ECS service remains in preview and is a Beta Service as  defined  by
          and  subject to the Beta Service Participation Service Terms located
          at https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms ("Beta Terms").  These  Beta
          Terms apply to your participation in this preview.

       Modifies the parameters of a service.

       For services using the rolling update (ECS ) you can update the desired
       count, the deployment configuration, the  network  configuration,  load
       balancers,  service  registries, enable ECS managed tags option, propa-
       gate tags option, task placement constraints and  strategies,  and  the
       task  definition.  When  you update any of these parameters, Amazon ECS
       starts new tasks with the new configuration.

       For services using the blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY ) deployment controller,
       only  the  desired count, deployment configuration, task placement con-
       straints and strategies, enable ECS managed tags option, and  propagate
       tags can be updated using this API. If the network configuration, plat-
       form version, task definition, or load balancer  need  to  be  updated,
       create   a   new  CodeDeploy  deployment.  For  more  information,  see
       CreateDeployment in the CodeDeploy API Reference .

       For services using an external deployment controller,  you  can  update
       only  the  desired  count,  task  placement constraints and strategies,
       health check grace period, enable ECS managed tags option,  and  propa-
       gate  tags  option,  using this API. If the launch type, load balancer,
       network configuration, platform version, or task definition need to  be
       updated, create a new task set For more information, see  CreateTaskSet
       .

       You can add to or subtract from the number of instantiations of a  task
       definition  in  a service by specifying the cluster that the service is
       running in and a new desiredCount parameter.

       If you have updated the Docker image of your application, you can  cre-
       ate  a  new  task definition with that image and deploy it to your ser-
       vice. The service scheduler uses the minimum healthy percent and  maxi-
       mum  percent  parameters (in the service's deployment configuration) to
       determine the deployment strategy.

       NOTE:
          If your updated Docker image uses the same tag as what is in the ex-
          isting  task definition for your service (for example, my_image:lat-
          est ), you don't need to create a new revision of your task  defini-
          tion.  You  can  update the service using the forceNewDeployment op-
          tion. The new tasks launched by the deployment pull the current  im-
          age/tag combination from your repository when they start.

       You  can  also update the deployment configuration of a service. When a
       deployment is triggered by updating the task definition of  a  service,
       the  service  scheduler  uses  the deployment configuration parameters,
       minimumHealthyPercent and maximumPercent , to determine the  deployment
       strategy.

       o If  minimumHealthyPercent is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore de-
         siredCount temporarily during a deployment. For example, if  desired-
         Count  is  four  tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler to stop
         two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Tasks for  services
         that  don't  use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in
         the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that use a  load  balancer  are
         considered  healthy  if they're in the RUNNING state and are reported
         as healthy by the load balancer.

       o The maximumPercent parameter represents an upper limit on the  number
         of  running  tasks  during a deployment. You can use it to define the
         deployment batch size. For example, if desiredCount is four tasks,  a
         maximum  of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four older
         tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to  do  this  are
         available).

       When  UpdateService stops a task during a deployment, the equivalent of
       docker stop is issued to the containers running in the task.  This  re-
       sults in a SIGTERM and a 30-second timeout. After this, SIGKILL is sent
       and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the container  handles  the
       SIGTERM  gracefully  and  exits within 30 seconds from receiving it, no
       SIGKILL is sent.

       When the service scheduler  launches  new  tasks,  it  determines  task
       placement in your cluster with the following logic.

       o Determine  which  of the container instances in your cluster can sup-
         port your service's task definition. For example, they have  the  re-
         quired CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes.

       o By  default,  the  service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across
         Availability Zones in this manner even though you can choose  a  dif-
         ferent placement strategy.

         o Sort  the valid container instances by the fewest number of running
           tasks for this service in the same Availability  Zone  as  the  in-
           stance.  For  example,  if  zone A has one running service task and
           zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances  in  either
           zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.

         o Place  the new service task on a valid container instance in an op-
           timal Availability Zone (based on  the  previous  steps),  favoring
           container  instances  with  the  fewest number of running tasks for
           this service.

       When the service scheduler stops running tasks, it attempts to maintain
       balance across the Availability Zones in your cluster using the follow-
       ing logic:

       o Sort the container instances by the largest number of  running  tasks
         for  this  service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For
         example, if zone A has one running service task and  zones  B  and  C
         each  have two, container instances in either zone B or C are consid-
         ered optimal for termination.

       o Stop the task on a container instance in an optimal Availability Zone
         (based  on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the
         largest number of running tasks for this service.

       NOTE:
          You must have a service-linked role when you update any of the  fol-
          lowing  service  properties. If you specified a custom IAM role when
          you created the  service,  Amazon  ECS  automatically  replaces  the
          roleARN  associated  with  the  service  with  the  ARN of your ser-
          vice-linked role. For more information, see Service-linked roles  in
          the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The  short  name  or  full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster
          that your service runs on. If you do not specify a cluster, the  de-
          fault cluster is assumed.

       --service (string)
          The name of the service to update.

       --desired-count (integer)
          The  number  of instantiations of the task to place and keep running
          in your service.

       --task-definition (string)
          The family and revision (family:revision ) or full ARN of  the  task
          definition  to  run in your service. If a revision is not specified,
          the latest ACTIVE revision is used. If you modify the  task  defini-
          tion with UpdateService , Amazon ECS spawns a task with the new ver-
          sion of the task definition and then stops an old task after the new
          version is running.

       --capacity-provider-strategy (list)
          The capacity provider strategy to update the service to use.

          if  the  service uses the default capacity provider strategy for the
          cluster, the service can be updated to  use  one  or  more  capacity
          providers as opposed to the default capacity provider strategy. How-
          ever, when a service is using a capacity  provider  strategy  that's
          not the default capacity provider strategy, the service can't be up-
          dated to use the cluster's default capacity provider strategy.

          A capacity provider  strategy  consists  of  one  or  more  capacity
          providers along with the base and weight to assign to them. A capac-
          ity provider must be associated with the cluster to be used in a ca-
          pacity  provider  strategy.  The  PutClusterCapacityProviders API is
          used to associate a capacity provider with a cluster. Only  capacity
          providers with an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used.

          If  specifying  a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group,
          the  capacity  provider  must  already  be  created.  New   capacity
          providers can be created with the  CreateCapacityProvider API opera-
          tion.

          To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either  the  FARGATE  or
          FARGATE_SPOT  capacity providers. The Fargate capacity providers are
          available to all accounts and only need  to  be  associated  with  a
          cluster to be used.

          The  PutClusterCapacityProviders API operation is used to update the
          list of available capacity providers for a cluster after the cluster
          is created.

          (structure)
              The details of a capacity provider strategy. A capacity provider
              strategy can be set when using the   RunTask  or   CreateCluster
              APIs  or as the default capacity provider strategy for a cluster
              with the  CreateCluster API.

              Only capacity providers that are already associated with a clus-
              ter  and  have an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used in a ca-
              pacity provider strategy. The   PutClusterCapacityProviders  API
              is used to associate a capacity provider with a cluster.

              If  specifying  a  capacity  provider  that uses an Auto Scaling
              group, the capacity provider must already be created.  New  Auto
              Scaling  group  capacity providers can be created with the  Cre-
              ateCapacityProvider API operation.

              To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either  the  FARGATE
              or   FARGATE_SPOT   capacity  providers.  The  Fargate  capacity
              providers are available to all accounts and only need to be  as-
              sociated with a cluster to be used in a capacity provider strat-
              egy.

              A capacity provider strategy may contain a maximum of 6 capacity
              providers.

              capacityProvider -> (string)
                 The short name of the capacity provider.

              weight -> (integer)
                 The  weight  value  designates the relative percentage of the
                 total number of tasks launched that should use the  specified
                 capacity  provider. The weight value is taken into considera-
                 tion after the base value, if defined, is satisfied.

                 If no weight value is specified, the default value  of  0  is
                 used. When multiple capacity providers are specified within a
                 capacity provider strategy, at  least  one  of  the  capacity
                 providers  must have a weight value greater than zero and any
                 capacity providers with a weight of 0 can't be used to  place
                 tasks. If you specify multiple capacity providers in a strat-
                 egy that all have a weight of 0 , any RunTask  or  CreateSer-
                 vice actions using the capacity provider strategy will fail.

                 An  example scenario for using weights is defining a strategy
                 that contains two capacity providers and both have  a  weight
                 of  1  ,  then  when the base is satisfied, the tasks will be
                 split evenly across the two capacity  providers.  Using  that
                 same  logic,  if  you  specify  a  weight  of  1  for capaci-
                 tyProviderA and a weight of 4 for  capacityProviderB  ,  then
                 for  every one task that's run using capacityProviderA , four
                 tasks would use capacityProviderB .

              base -> (integer)
                 The base value designates how many tasks, at  a  minimum,  to
                 run  on  the  specified  capacity provider. Only one capacity
                 provider in a capacity provider strategy can have a base  de-
                 fined.  If  no  value is specified, the default value of 0 is
                 used.

          [
            {

              "base": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --deployment-configuration (structure)
          Optional deployment parameters that control how many tasks run  dur-
          ing the deployment and the ordering of stopping and starting tasks.

          deploymentCircuitBreaker -> (structure)

              NOTE:
                 The  deployment circuit breaker can only be used for services
                 using the rolling update (ECS ) deployment type.

              The deployment circuit breaker determines whether a service  de-
              ployment will fail if the service can't reach a steady state. If
              deployment circuit breaker is enabled, a service deployment will
              transition  to  a  failed state and stop launching new tasks. If
              rollback is enabled, when a service deployment fails,  the  ser-
              vice  is  rolled back to the last deployment that completed suc-
              cessfully.

              enable -> (boolean)
                 Determines whether to  use  the  deployment  circuit  breaker
                 logic for the service.

              rollback -> (boolean)
                 Determines  whether  to configure Amazon ECS to roll back the
                 service if a service deployment fails.  If  rollback  is  en-
                 abled, when a service deployment fails, the service is rolled
                 back to the last deployment that completed successfully.

          maximumPercent -> (integer)
              If a service is using the rolling update (ECS ) deployment type,
              the  maximum  percent parameter represents an upper limit on the
              number of tasks in a service that are allowed in the RUNNING  or
              PENDING  state  during  a deployment, as a percentage of the de-
              sired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest integer), and
              while  any  container instances are in the DRAINING state if the
              service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter
              enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if
              your service has a desired number of four tasks  and  a  maximum
              percent  value  of  200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks
              before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the  cluster
              resources  required to do this are available). The default value
              for maximum percent is 200%.

              If a service is using the blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY ) or  EXTERNAL
              deployment  types  and  tasks  that use the EC2 launch type, the
              maximum percent value is set to the default value and is used to
              define the upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service
              that remain in the RUNNING state while the  container  instances
              are  in  the DRAINING state. If the tasks in the service use the
              Fargate launch type, the maximum percent value is not used,  al-
              though it is returned when describing your service.

          minimumHealthyPercent -> (integer)
              If a service is using the rolling update (ECS ) deployment type,
              the minimum healthy percent represents a lower limit on the num-
              ber  of tasks in a service that must remain in the RUNNING state
              during a deployment, as a percentage of the  desired  number  of
              tasks  (rounded  up  to the nearest integer), and while any con-
              tainer instances are in the DRAINING state if the  service  con-
              tains  tasks  using  the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables
              you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For ex-
              ample,  if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a
              minimum healthy percent of 50%, the scheduler may stop  two  ex-
              isting tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new
              tasks. Tasks for services that do not use a  load  balancer  are
              considered  healthy  if  they're in the RUNNING state; tasks for
              services that do use a load balancer are considered  healthy  if
              they're  in the RUNNING state and they're reported as healthy by
              the load balancer. The default value for minimum healthy percent
              is 100%.

              If  a service is using the blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY ) or EXTERNAL
              deployment types and tasks that use the  EC2  launch  type,  the
              minimum healthy percent value is set to the default value and is
              used to define the lower limit on the number of the tasks in the
              service that remain in the RUNNING state while the container in-
              stances are in the DRAINING state. If the tasks in  the  service
              use  the  Fargate launch type, the minimum healthy percent value
              is not used, although it is returned when describing  your  ser-
              vice.

       --network-configuration (structure)
          An object representing the network configuration for the service.

          awsvpcConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  VPC  subnets and security groups that are associated with a
              task.

              NOTE:
                 All specified subnets and security groups must  be  from  the

              assignPublicIp -> (string)
                 Whether the task's elastic network interface receives a  pub-
                 lic IP address. The default value is DISABLED .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[string,string],securityGroups=[string,string],assignPublicIp=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "awsvpcConfiguration": {
              "subnets": ["string", ...],
              "securityGroups": ["string", ...],
              "assignPublicIp": "ENABLED"|"DISABLED"
            }
          }

       --placement-constraints (list)
          An  array of task placement constraint objects to update the service
          to use. If no value is specified, the existing placement constraints
          for  the  service will remain unchanged. If this value is specified,
          it will override any existing placement constraints defined for  the
          service.  To  remove  all existing placement constraints, specify an
          empty array.

          You can specify a maximum of 10  constraints  for  each  task.  This
          limit  includes  constraints in the task definition and those speci-
          fied at runtime.

          (structure)
              An object representing a constraint on task placement. For  more
              information,  see Task Placement Constraints in the Amazon Elas-
              tic Container Service Developer Guide .

              NOTE:
                 If you're using the Fargate launch type, task placement  con-
                 straints aren't supported.

              type -> (string)
                 The  type  of constraint. Use distinctInstance to ensure that
                 each task in a particular group is  running  on  a  different
                 container instance. Use memberOf to restrict the selection to
                 a group of valid candidates.

              expression -> (string)
                 A cluster query language expression  to  apply  to  the  con-
                 straint.  The  expression  can  have a maximum length of 2000
                 characters. You can't specify an expression if the constraint
                 type  is distinctInstance . For more information, see Cluster
                 query language in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Devel-
                 oper Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          type=string,expression=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "type": "distinctInstance"|"memberOf",
              "expression": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --placement-strategy (list)
          The task placement strategy objects to update the service to use. If
          no value is specified, the existing placement strategy for the  ser-
          vice  will  remain  unchanged.  If  this value is specified, it will
          override the existing placement strategy defined for the service. To
          remove an existing placement strategy, specify an empty object.

          You can specify a maximum of five strategy rules for each service.

          (structure)
              The  task placement strategy for a task or service. For more in-
              formation, see Task Placement Strategies in the  Amazon  Elastic
              Container Service Developer Guide .

              type -> (string)
                 The type of placement strategy. The random placement strategy
                 randomly places tasks on  available  candidates.  The  spread
                 placement  strategy spreads placement across available candi-
                 dates evenly based on the field parameter. The binpack strat-
                 egy  places tasks on available candidates that have the least
                 available amount of the resource that's  specified  with  the
                 field  parameter.  For  example,  if you binpack on memory, a
                 task is placed on the instance with the least amount  of  re-
                 maining memory but still enough to run the task.

              field -> (string)
                 The  field  to  apply the placement strategy against. For the
                 spread placement strategy, valid values  are  instanceId  (or
                 host  , which has the same effect), or any platform or custom
                 attribute that's applied to a container instance, such as at-
                 tribute:ecs.availability-zone  .  For  the  binpack placement
                 strategy, valid values are cpu and memory .  For  the  random
                 placement strategy, this field is not used.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          type=string,field=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "type": "random"|"spread"|"binpack",
              "field": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --platform-version (string)
          The  platform version that your tasks in the service run on. A plat-
          form version is only specified for tasks using  the  Fargate  launch
          type.  If  a  platform version is not specified, the LATEST platform
          version is used. For more information, see Fargate Platform Versions
          in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

       --force-new-deployment | --no-force-new-deployment (boolean)
          Determines  whether to force a new deployment of the service. By de-
          fault, deployments aren't forced. You can use this option to start a
          new  deployment with no service definition changes. For example, you
          can update a service's tasks to use a newer Docker  image  with  the
          same  image/tag  combination  (my_image:latest  ) or to roll Fargate
          tasks onto a newer platform version.

       --health-check-grace-period-seconds (integer)
          The period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS  service  sched-
          uler  ignores  unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing target health checks
          after a task has first started. This is only valid if  your  service
          is configured to use a load balancer. If your service's tasks take a
          while to start and respond to Elastic Load Balancing health  checks,
          you  can  specify a health check grace period of up to 2,147,483,647
          seconds. During that time, the Amazon ECS service scheduler  ignores
          the  Elastic  Load  Balancing health check status. This grace period
          can prevent the ECS service scheduler  from  marking  tasks  as  un-
          healthy and stopping them before they have time to come up.

       --enable-execute-command | --disable-execute-command (boolean)
          If  true  ,  this  enables execute command functionality on all task
          containers.

          If you do not want to override the value that was set when the  ser-
          vice  was created, you can set this to null when performing this ac-
          tion.

       --enable-ecs-managed-tags | --no-enable-ecs-managed-tags (boolean)
          Determines whether to turn on Amazon ECS managed tags for the  tasks
          in  the  service.  For more information, see Tagging Your Amazon ECS
          Resources in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

          Only tasks launched after the update will reflect the update. To up-
          date the tags on all tasks, set forceNewDeployment to true , so that
          Amazon ECS starts new tasks with the updated tags.

       --load-balancers (list)
          A list of Elastic Load Balancing load balancer objects. It  contains
          the  load  balancer name, the container name, and the container port
          to access from the load balancer. The container name is  as  it  ap-
          pears in a container definition.

          When  you add, update, or remove a load balancer configuration, Ama-
          zon ECS starts new tasks with the  updated  Elastic  Load  Balancing
          configuration,  and  then stops the old tasks when the new tasks are
          running.

          You can remove existing loadBalancers by passing an empty list.

          (structure)
              The load balancer configuration to use with a  service  or  task
              set.

              For  specific  notes  and restrictions regarding the use of load
              balancers with services and task sets, see the CreateService and
              CreateTaskSet actions.

              When  you  add, update, or remove a load blaancer configuration,
              Amazon ECS starts a new deployment with the updated Elastic Load
              Balancing  configuration.  This  causes tasks to register to and
              deregister from load balancers.

              We recommend that you verify this on a test  environment  before
              you update the Elastic Load Balancing configuration.

              A service-linked role is required for services that use multiple
              target groups. For more information, see Service-linked roles in
              the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

              targetGroupArn -> (string)
                 The  full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Elastic Load Bal-
                 ancing target group or groups associated with  a  service  or
                 task set.

                 A  target  group ARN is only specified when using an Applica-
                 tion Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. If you're  using
                 a Classic Load Balancer, omit the target group ARN.

                 For  services  using  the  ECS deployment controller, you can
                 specify one or multiple target groups. For more  information,
                 see  Registering Multiple Target Groups with a Service in the
                 Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                 For services using  the  CODE_DEPLOY  deployment  controller,
                 you're required to define two target groups for the load bal-
                 ancer. For more information, see Blue/Green  Deployment  with
                 CodeDeploy  in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer
                 Guide .

                 WARNING:
                     If your service's task definition uses the awsvpc network
                     mode, you must choose ip as the target type, not instance
                     . Do this when creating your target groups because  tasks
                     that  use  the awsvpc network mode are associated with an
                     elastic network interface, not an  Amazon  EC2  instance.
                     This  network  mode  is  required  for the Fargate launch
                     type.

              loadBalancerName -> (string)
                 The name of the load balancer to associate  with  the  Amazon
                 ECS service or task set.

                 A  load  balancer name is only specified when using a Classic
                 Load Balancer. If you are using an Application Load  Balancer
                 or  a  Network Load Balancer the load balancer name parameter
                 should be omitted.

              containerName -> (string)
                 The name of the container (as it appears in a container defi-
                 nition) to associate with the load balancer.

              containerPort -> (integer)
                 The  port  on  the  container to associate with the load bal-
                 ancer. This port must correspond to a  containerPort  in  the
                 task definition the tasks in the service are using. For tasks
                 that use the EC2 launch type, the container instance  they're
                 launched on must allow ingress traffic on the hostPort of the
                 port mapping.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          targetGroupArn=string,loadBalancerName=string,containerName=string,containerPort=integer ...

              "containerPort": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --propagate-tags (string)
          Determines whether to propagate the tags from the task definition or
          the  service  to the task. If no value is specified, the tags aren't
          propagated.

          Only tasks launched after the update will reflect the update. To up-
          date the tags on all tasks, set forceNewDeployment to true , so that
          Amazon ECS starts new tasks with the updated tags.

          Possible values:

          o TASK_DEFINITION

          o SERVICE

          o NONE

       --service-registries (list)
          The details for the service discovery registries to assign  to  this
          service. For more information, see Service Discovery .

          When  you  add,  update, or remove the service registries configura-
          tion, Amazon ECS starts new tasks  with  the  updated  service  reg-
          istries  configuration,  and  then  stops the old tasks when the new
          tasks are running.

          You can remove existing serviceRegistries by passing an empty list.

          (structure)
              The details for the service registry.

              Each service may be associated with one service registry. Multi-
              ple service registries for each service are not supported.

              When  you add, update, or remove the service registries configu-
              ration, Amazon ECS starts a new deployment. New tasks are regis-
              tered  and deregistered to the updated service registry configu-
              ration.

              registryArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service  registry.  The
                 currently  supported  service registry is Cloud Map. For more
                 information, see CreateService .

              port -> (integer)
                 The port value used if your service discovery service  speci-
                 fied  an  SRV  record.  This  field might be used if both the
                 awsvpc network mode and SRV records are used.

              containerName -> (string)
                 The container name value to be used for your service  discov-
                 ery  service.  It's already specified in the task definition.
                 If the task definition that your service task specifies  uses
                 the  bridge or host network mode, you must specify a contain-
                 erName and containerPort combination from  the  task  defini-
                 tion. If the task definition that your service task specifies
                 uses the awsvpc network mode and a type  SRV  DNS  record  is
                 used,  you must specify either a containerName and container-
                 Port combination or a port value. However, you can't  specify
                 both.

              containerPort -> (integer)
                 The port value to be used for your service discovery service.
                 It's already specified in the task definition.  If  the  task
                 definition  your  service  task  specifies uses the bridge or
                 host network mode, you must specify a containerName and  con-
                 tainerPort  combination from the task definition. If the task
                 definition your service task specifies uses the  awsvpc  net-
                 work mode and a type SRV DNS record is used, you must specify
                 either a containerName and  containerPort  combination  or  a
                 port value. However, you can't specify both.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To change the task definition used in a service

       The following update-service example updates the  my-http-service  ser-
       vice to use the amazon-ecs-sample task definition.

          aws ecs update-service --service my-http-service --task-definition amazon-ecs-sample

       Example 2: To change the number of tasks in a service

       The  following update-service example updates the desired task count of
       the service my-http-service to 3.

          aws ecs update-service --service my-http-service --desired-count 3

OUTPUT
       service -> (structure)
          The full description of your service following the update call.

          serviceArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  that  identifies  the  service.  The  ARN contains the
              arn:aws:ecs namespace, followed by the Region  of  the  service,
              the  Amazon  Web  Services  account ID of the service owner, the
              service namespace, and  then  the  service  name.  For  example,
              arn:aws:ecs:region:012345678910:service/my-service .

          serviceName -> (string)
              The  name of your service. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and low-
              ercase), numbers, underscores, and hyphens are allowed.  Service
              names  must  be  unique  within a cluster. However, you can have
              similarly named services in multiple clusters within a Region or
              across multiple Regions.

          clusterArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the cluster that hosts the
              service.

          loadBalancers -> (list)
              A list of Elastic Load Balancing load balancer objects. It  con-
              tains  the  load balancer name, the container name, and the con-
              tainer port to access from the load balancer. The container name
              is as it appears in a container definition.

              (structure)
                 The load balancer configuration to use with a service or task
                 set.

                 For specific notes and restrictions regarding the use of load
                 balancers  with services and task sets, see the CreateService
                 and CreateTaskSet actions.

                 When you add, update, or remove a  load  blaancer  configura-
                 tion,  Amazon  ECS  starts  a new deployment with the updated
                 Elastic Load Balancing configuration. This  causes  tasks  to
                 register to and deregister from load balancers.

                 We  recommend  that you verify this on a test environment be-
                 fore you update the Elastic Load Balancing configuration.

                 A service-linked role is required for services that use  mul-
                 tiple target groups. For more information, see Service-linked
                 roles in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide
                 .

                 targetGroupArn -> (string)
                     The  full  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Elastic Load
                     Balancing target group or groups associated with  a  ser-
                     vice or task set.

                     A target group ARN is only specified when using an Appli-
                     cation Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. If  you're
                     using a Classic Load Balancer, omit the target group ARN.

                     For services using the ECS deployment controller, you can
                     specify one or multiple target groups. For more  informa-
                     tion,  see Registering Multiple Target Groups with a Ser-
                     vice in the Amazon Elastic  Container  Service  Developer
                     Guide .

                     For services using the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller,
                     you're required to define two target groups for the  load
                     balancer. For more information, see Blue/Green Deployment
                     with CodeDeploy in the Amazon Elastic  Container  Service
                     Developer Guide .

                     WARNING:
                        If your service's task definition uses the awsvpc net-
                        work mode, you must choose ip as the target type,  not
                        instance  .  Do  this when creating your target groups
                        because tasks that use the awsvpc network mode are as-
                        sociated  with  an  elastic  network interface, not an
                        Amazon EC2 instance. This network mode is required for
                        the Fargate launch type.

                 loadBalancerName -> (string)
                     The  name of the load balancer to associate with the Ama-
                     zon ECS service or task set.

                     A load balancer name is only specified when using a Clas-
                     sic  Load  Balancer. If you are using an Application Load
                     Balancer or a Network Load  Balancer  the  load  balancer
                     name parameter should be omitted.

                 containerName -> (string)
                     The  name  of the container (as it appears in a container
                     definition) to associate with the load balancer.

                 containerPort -> (integer)
                     The port on the container to associate with the load bal-
                     ancer.  This  port  must correspond to a containerPort in
                     the task definition the tasks in the service  are  using.
                     For tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the container in-
                     stance they're launched on must allow ingress traffic  on
                     the hostPort of the port mapping.

          serviceRegistries -> (list)
              The  details  for  the service discovery registries to assign to
              this service. For more information, see Service Discovery .

              (structure)
                 The details for the service registry.

                 Each service may be associated  with  one  service  registry.
                 Multiple  service  registries  for  each service are not sup-
                 ported.

                 When you add, update, or remove the service  registries  con-
                 figuration, Amazon ECS starts a new deployment. New tasks are
                 registered and deregistered to the updated  service  registry
                 configuration.

                 registryArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the service registry.
                     The currently supported service registry  is  Cloud  Map.
                     For more information, see CreateService .

                 port -> (integer)
                     The  port  value  used  if your service discovery service
                     specified an SRV record. This field might be used if both
                     the awsvpc network mode and SRV records are used.

                 containerName -> (string)
                     The container name value to be used for your service dis-
                     covery service. It's already specified in the task  defi-
                     nition.  If  the  task  definition that your service task
                     specifies uses the bridge or host network mode, you  must
                     specify  a  containerName  and  containerPort combination
                     from the task definition. If  the  task  definition  that
                     your  service task specifies uses the awsvpc network mode
                     and a type SRV DNS record is used, you must  specify  ei-
                     ther  a  containerName and containerPort combination or a
                     port value. However, you can't specify both.

                 containerPort -> (integer)
                     The port value to be used for your service discovery ser-
                     vice.  It's  already specified in the task definition. If
                     the task definition your service task specifies uses  the
                     bridge  or host network mode, you must specify a contain-
                     erName and containerPort combination from the task  defi-
                     nition.  If  the task definition your service task speci-
                     fies uses the awsvpc network mode  and  a  type  SRV  DNS
                     record  is  used, you must specify either a containerName
                     and containerPort combination or a port  value.  However,
                     you can't specify both.

          status -> (string)
              The  status of the service. The valid values are ACTIVE , DRAIN-
              ING , or INACTIVE .

          desiredCount -> (integer)
              The desired number of instantiations of the task  definition  to
              keep  running  on  the service. This value is specified when the
              service is created with  CreateService , and it can be  modified
              with  UpdateService .

          runningCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of  tasks  in  the  cluster that are in the RUNNING
              state.

          pendingCount -> (integer)
              The number of tasks in the  cluster  that  are  in  the  PENDING
              state.

          launchType -> (string)
              The  launch  type  the  service  is  using.  When  using the De-
              scribeServices API, this field is omitted  if  the  service  was
              created using a capacity provider strategy.

          capacityProviderStrategy -> (list)
              The  capacity provider strategy the service uses. When using the
              DescribeServices API, this field is omitted if the  service  was
              created using a launch type.

              (structure)
                 The  details  of  a  capacity  provider  strategy. A capacity
                 provider strategy can be set when using the  RunTask or  Cre-
                 ateCluster  APIs or as the default capacity provider strategy
                 for a cluster with the  CreateCluster API.

                 Only capacity providers that are already  associated  with  a
                 cluster  and have an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used in
                 a  capacity   provider   strategy.   The    PutClusterCapaci-
                 tyProviders API is used to associate a capacity provider with
                 a cluster.

                 If specifying a capacity provider that uses an  Auto  Scaling
                 group,  the  capacity  provider  must already be created. New
                 Auto Scaling group capacity providers can be created with the
                 CreateCapacityProvider API operation.

                 To  use  a Fargate capacity provider, specify either the FAR-
                 GATE or FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers. The Fargate capacity
                 providers  are  available to all accounts and only need to be
                 associated with a cluster to be used in a  capacity  provider
                 strategy.

                 A  capacity  provider strategy may contain a maximum of 6 ca-
                 pacity providers.

                 capacityProvider -> (string)
                     The short name of the capacity provider.

                 weight -> (integer)
                     The weight value designates the  relative  percentage  of
                     the  total  number  of tasks launched that should use the
                     specified capacity provider. The weight  value  is  taken
                     into  consideration  after the base value, if defined, is
                     satisfied.

                     If no weight value is specified, the default value  of  0
                     is  used.  When multiple capacity providers are specified
                     within a capacity provider strategy, at least one of  the
                     capacity  providers must have a weight value greater than
                     zero and any capacity providers with a weight of 0  can't
                     be  used to place tasks. If you specify multiple capacity
                     providers in a strategy that all have a weight of 0 , any
                     RunTask  or  CreateService  actions  using  the  capacity
                     provider strategy will fail.

                     An example scenario  for  using  weights  is  defining  a
                     strategy  that  contains  two capacity providers and both
                     have a weight of 1 , then when the base is satisfied, the
                     tasks  will  be  split  evenly  across  the  two capacity
                     providers. Using that same logic, if you specify a weight
                     of  1 for capacityProviderA and a weight of 4 for capaci-
                     tyProviderB , then for every one task  that's  run  using
                     capacityProviderA   ,   four   tasks  would  use  capaci-
                     tyProviderB .

                 base -> (integer)
                     The base value designates how many tasks, at  a  minimum,
                     to  run  on the specified capacity provider. Only one ca-
                     pacity provider in a capacity provider strategy can  have
                     a  base  defined.  If  no value is specified, the default
                     value of 0 is used.

          platformVersion -> (string)
              The platform version to run your service on. A platform  version
              is  only  specified for tasks that are hosted on Fargate. If one
              isn't specified, the LATEST platform version is used.  For  more
              information, see Fargate Platform Versions in the Amazon Elastic
              Container Service Developer Guide .

          platformFamily -> (string)
              The operating system that your tasks in the service  run  on.  A
              platform  family  is  specified only for tasks using the Fargate
              launch type.

              All tasks that run as part of this service  must  use  the  same
              platformFamily value as the service (for example, LINUX ).

          taskDefinition -> (string)
              The  task definition to use for tasks in the service. This value
              is specified when the service is created with   CreateService  ,
              and it can be modified with  UpdateService .

          deploymentConfiguration -> (structure)
              Optional  deployment  parameters that control how many tasks run
              during the deployment and the ordering of stopping and  starting
              tasks.

              deploymentCircuitBreaker -> (structure)

                 NOTE:
                     The  deployment circuit breaker can only be used for ser-
                     vices using the rolling update (ECS ) deployment type.

                 The deployment circuit breaker determines whether  a  service
                 deployment  will  fail  if  the  service can't reach a steady
                 state. If deployment circuit breaker is  enabled,  a  service
                 deployment will transition to a failed state and stop launch-
                 ing new tasks. If rollback is enabled, when a service deploy-
                 ment fails, the service is rolled back to the last deployment
                 that completed successfully.

                 enable -> (boolean)
                     Determines whether to use the deployment circuit  breaker
                     logic for the service.

                 rollback -> (boolean)
                     Determines  whether  to configure Amazon ECS to roll back
                     the service if a service deployment fails. If rollback is
                     enabled,  when a service deployment fails, the service is
                     rolled back to the last deployment  that  completed  suc-
                     cessfully.

              maximumPercent -> (integer)
                 If  a  service  is using the rolling update (ECS ) deployment
                 type, the maximum percent parameter represents an upper limit
                 on  the  number of tasks in a service that are allowed in the
                 RUNNING or PENDING state during a deployment, as a percentage
                 of  the  desired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest
                 integer), and while any container instances are in the DRAIN-
                 ING  state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch
                 type. This parameter enables you  to  define  the  deployment
                 batch size. For example, if your service has a desired number
                 of four tasks and a maximum percent value of 200%, the sched-
                 uler  may start four new tasks before stopping the four older
                 tasks (provided that the cluster  resources  required  to  do
                 this are available). The default value for maximum percent is
                 200%.

                 If a service is using the blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY ) or EXTER-
                 NAL  deployment types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type,
                 the maximum percent value is set to the default value and  is
                 used  to define the upper limit on the number of the tasks in
                 the service that remain in the RUNNING state while  the  con-
                 tainer  instances  are in the DRAINING state. If the tasks in
                 the service use the Fargate launch type, the maximum  percent
                 value  is  not  used, although it is returned when describing
                 your service.

              minimumHealthyPercent -> (integer)
                 If a service is using the rolling update  (ECS  )  deployment
                 type, the minimum healthy percent represents a lower limit on
                 the number of tasks in a service that must remain in the RUN-
                 NING  state  during  a deployment, as a percentage of the de-
                 sired number of tasks (rounded up to  the  nearest  integer),
                 and  while  any container instances are in the DRAINING state
                 if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This
                 parameter  enables  you  to  deploy  without using additional
                 cluster capacity. For example, if your service has a  desired
                 number  of  four  tasks and a minimum healthy percent of 50%,
                 the scheduler may stop two existing tasks to free up  cluster
                 capacity  before  starting  two new tasks. Tasks for services
                 that do not use a load balancer  are  considered  healthy  if
                 they're  in the RUNNING state; tasks for services that do use
                 a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUN-
                 NING  state  and they're reported as healthy by the load bal-
                 ancer. The default value for minimum healthy percent is 100%.

                 If a service is using the blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY ) or EXTER-
                 NAL  deployment types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type,
                 the minimum healthy percent value is set to the default value
                 and  is  used  to define the lower limit on the number of the
                 tasks in the service that remain in the RUNNING  state  while
                 the  container  instances  are  in the DRAINING state. If the
                 tasks in the service use the Fargate launch type, the minimum
                 healthy  percent  value  is not used, although it is returned
                 when describing your service.

          taskSets -> (list)
              Information about a set of Amazon ECS tasks in either an CodeDe-
              ploy  or an EXTERNAL deployment. An Amazon ECS task set includes
              details such as the desired number of tasks, how many tasks  are
              running, and whether the task set serves production traffic.

              (structure)
                 Information about a set of Amazon ECS tasks in either an Cod-
                 eDeploy or an EXTERNAL deployment. An Amazon ECS task set in-
                 cludes  details such as the desired number of tasks, how many
                 tasks are running, and whether the task set serves production
                 traffic.

                 id -> (string)
                     The ID of the task set.

                 taskSetArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task set.

                 serviceArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the service the task
                     set exists in.

                 clusterArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  cluster  that  the
                     service that hosts the task set exists in.

                 startedBy -> (string)
                     The  tag specified when a task set is started. If an Cod-
                     eDeploy deployment created the task  set,  the  startedBy
                     parameter is CODE_DEPLOY . If an external deployment cre-
                     ated the task set, the startedBy field isn't used.

                 externalId -> (string)
                     The external ID associated with the task set.

                     If an CodeDeploy deployment created a task set,  the  ex-
                     ternalId parameter contains the CodeDeploy deployment ID.

                     If  a  task set is created for an external deployment and
                     is associated with a service discovery registry, the  ex-
                     ternalId  parameter contains the ECS_TASK_SET_EXTERNAL_ID
                     Cloud Map attribute.

                 status -> (string)
                     The status of the task set. The following describes  each
                     state.
                        PRIMARY

                     The task set is serving production traffic.
                        ACTIVE

                     The task set isn't serving production traffic.
                        DRAINING

                     The  tasks  in  the task set are being stopped, and their
                     corresponding targets are being deregistered  from  their
                     target group.

                 taskDefinition -> (string)
                     The task definition that the task set is using.

                 computedDesiredCount -> (integer)
                     The computed desired count for the task set. This is cal-
                     culated by multiplying the service's desiredCount by  the
                     task set's scale percentage. The result is always rounded
                     up. For example, if the computed desired count is 1.2, it
                     rounds up to 2 tasks.

                 pendingCount -> (integer)
                     The number of tasks in the task set that are in the PEND-
                     ING status during a deployment. A  task  in  the  PENDING
                     state is preparing to enter the RUNNING state. A task set
                     enters the PENDING status when it launches for the  first
                     time  or  when  it's restarted after being in the STOPPED
                     state.

                 runningCount -> (integer)
                     The number of tasks in the task set that are in the  RUN-
                     NING  status  during  a deployment. A task in the RUNNING
                     state is running and ready for use.

                 createdAt -> (timestamp)
                     The Unix timestamp for the time when  the  task  set  was
                     created.

                 updatedAt -> (timestamp)
                     The  Unix  timestamp  for  the time when the task set was
                     last updated.

                 launchType -> (string)
                     The launch type the tasks in the task set are using.  For
                     more information, see Amazon ECS launch types in the Ama-
                     zon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                 capacityProviderStrategy -> (list)
                     The capacity provider strategy that are  associated  with
                     the task set.

                     (structure)
                        The  details of a capacity provider strategy. A capac-
                        ity provider strategy can be set when using the   Run-
                        Task or  CreateCluster APIs or as the default capacity
                        provider strategy for a cluster with the   CreateClus-
                        ter API.

                        Only  capacity  providers  that are already associated
                        with a cluster and have an ACTIVE or  UPDATING  status
                        can be used in a capacity provider strategy. The  Put-
                        ClusterCapacityProviders API is used  to  associate  a
                        capacity provider with a cluster.

                        If  specifying  a  capacity provider that uses an Auto
                        Scaling group, the capacity provider must  already  be
                        created. New Auto Scaling group capacity providers can
                        be created with the  CreateCapacityProvider API opera-
                        tion.

                        To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either the
                        FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers.  The  Far-
                        gate  capacity providers are available to all accounts
                        and only need to be associated with a  cluster  to  be
                        used in a capacity provider strategy.

                        A  capacity provider strategy may contain a maximum of
                        6 capacity providers.

                        capacityProvider -> (string)
                            The short name of the capacity provider.

                        weight -> (integer)
                            The weight value designates the relative  percent-
                            age  of  the  total  number of tasks launched that
                            should use the specified  capacity  provider.  The
                            weight value is taken into consideration after the
                            base value, if defined, is satisfied.

                            If no weight value is specified, the default value
                            of 0 is used. When multiple capacity providers are
                            specified within a capacity provider strategy,  at
                            least  one  of  the capacity providers must have a
                            weight value greater than zero  and  any  capacity
                            providers  with  a  weight  of  0 can't be used to
                            place tasks.  If  you  specify  multiple  capacity
                            providers  in a strategy that all have a weight of
                            0 , any RunTask or CreateService actions using the
                            capacity provider strategy will fail.

                            An  example scenario for using weights is defining
                            a strategy that contains  two  capacity  providers
                            and  both  have a weight of 1 , then when the base
                            is satisfied,  the  tasks  will  be  split  evenly
                            across the two capacity providers. Using that same
                            logic, if you specify a weight of  1  for  capaci-
                            tyProviderA   and   a  weight  of  4  for  capaci-
                            tyProviderB , then for every one task  that's  run
                            using capacityProviderA , four tasks would use ca-
                            pacityProviderB .

                        base -> (integer)
                            The base value designates how  many  tasks,  at  a
                            minimum,   to   run   on  the  specified  capacity
                            provider. Only one capacity provider in a capacity
                            provider  strategy  can have a base defined. If no
                            value is specified, the  default  value  of  0  is
                            used.

                 platformVersion -> (string)
                     The  Fargate platform version where the tasks in the task
                     set are running. A platform version is only specified for
                     tasks  run  on Fargate. For more information, see Fargate
                     platform versions in the Amazon Elastic Container Service
                     Developer Guide .

                 platformFamily -> (string)
                     The  operating system that your tasks in the set are run-
                     ning on. A platform family is specified  only  for  tasks
                     that use the Fargate launch type.

                     All tasks in the set must have the same value.

                 networkConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The network configuration for the task set.

                     awsvpcConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The  VPC  subnets and security groups that are associ-
                        ated with a task.

                        NOTE:
                            All specified subnets and security groups must  be
                            from the same VPC.

                        subnets -> (list)
                            The IDs of the subnets associated with the task or
                            service. There's a limit of 16 subnets that can be
                            specified per AwsVpcConfiguration .

                            NOTE:
                               All  specified  subnets  must  be from the same
                               VPC.

                            (string)

                        securityGroups -> (list)
                            The IDs of the security groups associated with the
                            task  or  service. If you don't specify a security
                            group, the default security group for the  VPC  is
                            used.  There's  a  limit of 5 security groups that
                            can be specified per AwsVpcConfiguration .

                            NOTE:
                               All specified security groups must be from  the
                               same VPC.

                            (string)

                        assignPublicIp -> (string)
                            Whether  the  task's elastic network interface re-
                            ceives a public IP address. The default  value  is
                            DISABLED .

                 loadBalancers -> (list)
                     Details on a load balancer that are used with a task set.

                     (structure)
                        The  load balancer configuration to use with a service
                        or task set.

                        For specific notes and restrictions regarding the  use
                        of load balancers with services and task sets, see the
                        CreateService and CreateTaskSet actions.

                        When you add, update, or remove a load  blaancer  con-
                        figuration,  Amazon  ECS  starts a new deployment with
                        the updated Elastic Load Balancing configuration. This
                        causes  tasks  to register to and deregister from load
                        balancers.

                        We recommend that you verify this on a  test  environ-
                        ment before you update the Elastic Load Balancing con-
                        figuration.

                        A service-linked role is required  for  services  that
                        use  multiple target groups. For more information, see
                        Service-linked roles in the Amazon  Elastic  Container
                        Service Developer Guide .

                        targetGroupArn -> (string)
                            The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Elastic
                            Load Balancing target group or  groups  associated
                            with a service or task set.

                            A target group ARN is only specified when using an
                            Application Load Balancer  or  Network  Load  Bal-
                            ancer.  If  you're  using a Classic Load Balancer,
                            omit the target group ARN.

                            For services using the ECS deployment  controller,
                            you can specify one or multiple target groups. For
                            more information, see Registering Multiple  Target
                            Groups  with  a Service in the Amazon Elastic Con-
                            tainer Service Developer Guide .

                            For services using the CODE_DEPLOY deployment con-
                            troller,  you're  required  to  define  two target
                            groups for the load balancer.  For  more  informa-
                            tion, see Blue/Green Deployment with CodeDeploy in
                            the Amazon  Elastic  Container  Service  Developer
                            Guide .

                            WARNING:
                               If  your  service's  task  definition  uses the
                               awsvpc network mode, you must choose ip as  the
                               target type, not instance . Do this when creat-
                               ing your target groups because tasks  that  use
                               the  awsvpc network mode are associated with an
                               elastic network interface, not  an  Amazon  EC2
                               instance. This network mode is required for the
                               Fargate launch type.

                        loadBalancerName -> (string)
                            The name of the load balancer  to  associate  with
                            the Amazon ECS service or task set.

                            A  load balancer name is only specified when using
                            a Classic Load Balancer. If you are using  an  Ap-
                            plication Load Balancer or a Network Load Balancer
                            the load balancer name parameter should  be  omit-
                            ted.

                        containerName -> (string)
                            The name of the container (as it appears in a con-
                            tainer definition) to associate with the load bal-
                            ancer.

                        containerPort -> (integer)
                            The  port  on  the container to associate with the
                            load balancer. This port must correspond to a con-
                            tainerPort in the task definition the tasks in the
                            service are using. For  tasks  that  use  the  EC2
                            launch   type,   the  container  instance  they're
                            launched on must  allow  ingress  traffic  on  the
                            hostPort of the port mapping.

                 serviceRegistries -> (list)
                     The  details  for the service discovery registries to as-
                     sign to this task set. For more information, see  Service
                     discovery .

                     (structure)
                        The details for the service registry.

                        Each  service  may be associated with one service reg-
                        istry. Multiple service registries  for  each  service
                        are not supported.

                        When you add, update, or remove the service registries
                        configuration, Amazon ECS starts a new deployment. New
                        tasks  are  registered and deregistered to the updated
                        service registry configuration.

                        registryArn -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service reg-
                            istry. The currently supported service registry is
                            Cloud Map. For more information, see CreateService
                            .

                        port -> (integer)
                            The port value used if your service discovery ser-
                            vice specified an SRV record. This field might  be
                            used  if  both  the  awsvpc  network  mode and SRV
                            records are used.

                        containerName -> (string)
                            The container name value to be used for your  ser-
                            vice  discovery service. It's already specified in
                            the task definition. If the task  definition  that
                            your  service  task  specifies  uses the bridge or
                            host network mode, you must specify  a  container-
                            Name  and  containerPort combination from the task
                            definition. If the task definition that your  ser-
                            vice  task  specifies uses the awsvpc network mode
                            and a type SRV DNS record is used, you must  spec-
                            ify  either a containerName and containerPort com-
                            bination or a port value. However, you can't spec-
                            ify both.

                        containerPort -> (integer)
                            The port value to be used for your service discov-
                            ery service. It's already specified  in  the  task
                            definition.  If  the  task definition your service
                            task specifies uses the  bridge  or  host  network
                            mode,  you  must  specify a containerName and con-
                            tainerPort combination from the  task  definition.
                            If the task definition your service task specifies
                            uses the awsvpc network mode and a  type  SRV  DNS
                            record is used, you must specify either a contain-
                            erName and containerPort  combination  or  a  port
                            value. However, you can't specify both.

                 scale -> (structure)
                     A  floating-point  percentage  of  your desired number of
                     tasks to place and keep running in the task set.

                     value -> (double)
                        The value, specified as a percent total of a service's
                        desiredCount  , to scale the task set. Accepted values
                        are numbers between 0 and 100.

                     unit -> (string)
                        The unit of measure for the scale value.

                 stabilityStatus -> (string)
                     The stability status. This indicates whether the task set
                     has  reached  a steady state. If the following conditions
                     are met, the task set sre in STEADY_STATE :

                     o The task runningCount is equal to the  computedDesired-
                       Count .

                     o The pendingCount is 0 .

                     o There  are  no  tasks that are running on container in-
                       stances in the DRAINING status.

                     o All tasks are reporting a healthy status from the  load
                       balancers,  service  discovery,  and  container  health
                       checks.

                     If any of those conditions aren't met, the stability sta-
                     tus returns STABILIZING .

                 stabilityStatusAt -> (timestamp)
                     The Unix timestamp for the time when the task set stabil-
                     ity status was retrieved.

                 tags -> (list)
                     The metadata that you apply to the task set to  help  you
                     categorize  and organize them. Each tag consists of a key
                     and an optional value. You define both.

                     The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                     o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                     o For each resource, each tag key  must  be  unique,  and
                       each tag key can have only one value.

                     o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                     o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                     o If your tagging schema is used across multiple services
                       and resources, remember that other  services  may  have
                       restrictions  on  allowed characters. Generally allowed
                       characters are: letters,  numbers,  and  spaces  repre-
                       sentable  in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - =
                       . _ : / @.

                     o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                     o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase com-
                       bination  of such as a prefix for either keys or values
                       as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You can-
                       not edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix.
                       Tags with this prefix do not count  against  your  tags
                       per resource limit.

                     (structure)
                        The  metadata that you apply to a resource to help you
                        categorize and organize them. Each tag consists  of  a
                        key and an optional value. You define them.

                        The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                        o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                        o For  each resource, each tag key must be unique, and
                          each tag key can have only one value.

                        o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                        o Maximum value length -  256  Unicode  characters  in
                          UTF-8

                        o If  your tagging schema is used across multiple ser-
                          vices and resources, remember  that  other  services
                          may  have restrictions on allowed characters. Gener-
                          ally allowed characters are: letters,  numbers,  and
                          spaces  representable  in  UTF-8,  and the following
                          characters: + - = . _ : / @.

                        o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                        o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper  or  lowercase
                          combination  of  such as a prefix for either keys or
                          values as it is reserved  for  Amazon  Web  Services
                          use.  You  cannot  edit or delete tag keys or values
                          with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count
                          against your tags per resource limit.

                        key -> (string)
                            One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A
                            key is a general label that acts like  a  category
                            for more specific tag values.

                        value -> (string)
                            The optional part of a key-value pair that make up
                            a tag. A value acts as a descriptor within  a  tag
                            category (key).

          deployments -> (list)
              The current state of deployments for the service.

              (structure)
                 The details of an Amazon ECS service deployment. This is used
                 only when a service uses the ECS deployment controller type.

                 id -> (string)
                     The ID of the deployment.

                 status -> (string)
                     The status of the  deployment.  The  following  describes
                     each state.
                        PRIMARY

                     The most recent deployment of a service.
                        ACTIVE

                     A  service  deployment  that still has running tasks, but
                     are in the process of being replaced with a  new  PRIMARY
                     deployment.
                        INACTIVE

                     A deployment that has been completely replaced.

                 taskDefinition -> (string)
                     The  most  recent  task definition that was specified for
                     the tasks in the service to use.

                 desiredCount -> (integer)
                     The most recent desired count of tasks that was specified
                     for the service to deploy or maintain.

                 pendingCount -> (integer)
                     The  number  of  tasks  in the deployment that are in the
                     PENDING status.

                 runningCount -> (integer)
                     The number of tasks in the deployment  that  are  in  the
                     RUNNING status.

                 failedTasks -> (integer)
                     The  number  of consecutively failed tasks in the deploy-
                     ment. A task is  considered  a  failure  if  the  service
                     scheduler can't launch the task, the task doesn't transi-
                     tion to a RUNNING state, or if it fails any  of  its  de-
                     fined health checks and is stopped.

                     NOTE:
                        Once a service deployment has one or more successfully
                        running tasks, the failed task count  resets  to  zero
                        and stops being evaluated.

                 createdAt -> (timestamp)
                     The  Unix timestamp for the time when the service deploy-
                     ment was created.

                 updatedAt -> (timestamp)
                     The Unix timestamp for the time when the service  deploy-
                     ment was last updated.

                 capacityProviderStrategy -> (list)
                     The capacity provider strategy that the deployment is us-
                     ing.

                     (structure)
                        The details of a capacity provider strategy. A  capac-
                        ity  provider strategy can be set when using the  Run-
                        Task or  CreateCluster APIs or as the default capacity
                        provider  strategy for a cluster with the  CreateClus-
                        ter API.

                        Only capacity providers that  are  already  associated
                        with  a  cluster and have an ACTIVE or UPDATING status
                        can be used in a capacity provider strategy. The  Put-
                        ClusterCapacityProviders  API  is  used to associate a
                        capacity provider with a cluster.

                        If specifying a capacity provider that  uses  an  Auto
                        Scaling  group,  the capacity provider must already be
                        created. New Auto Scaling group capacity providers can
                        be created with the  CreateCapacityProvider API opera-
                        tion.

                        To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either the
                        FARGATE  or  FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers. The Far-
                        gate capacity providers are available to all  accounts
                        and  only  need  to be associated with a cluster to be
                        used in a capacity provider strategy.

                        A capacity provider strategy may contain a maximum  of
                        6 capacity providers.

                        capacityProvider -> (string)
                            The short name of the capacity provider.

                        weight -> (integer)
                            The  weight value designates the relative percent-
                            age of the total number  of  tasks  launched  that
                            should  use  the  specified capacity provider. The
                            weight value is taken into consideration after the
                            base value, if defined, is satisfied.

                            If no weight value is specified, the default value
                            of 0 is used. When multiple capacity providers are
                            specified  within a capacity provider strategy, at
                            least one of the capacity providers  must  have  a
                            weight  value  greater  than zero and any capacity
                            providers with a weight of  0  can't  be  used  to
                            place  tasks.  If  you  specify  multiple capacity
                            providers in a strategy that all have a weight  of
                            0 , any RunTask or CreateService actions using the
                            capacity provider strategy will fail.

                            An example scenario for using weights is  defining
                            a  strategy  that  contains two capacity providers
                            and both have a weight of 1 , then when  the  base
                            is  satisfied,  the  tasks  will  be  split evenly
                            across the two capacity providers. Using that same
                            logic,  if  you  specify a weight of 1 for capaci-
                            tyProviderA  and  a  weight  of  4   for   capaci-
                            tyProviderB  ,  then for every one task that's run
                            using capacityProviderA , four tasks would use ca-
                            pacityProviderB .

                        base -> (integer)
                            The  base  value  designates  how many tasks, at a
                            minimum,  to  run  on   the   specified   capacity
                            provider. Only one capacity provider in a capacity
                            provider strategy can have a base defined.  If  no
                            value  is  specified,  the  default  value of 0 is
                            used.

                 launchType -> (string)
                     The launch type the tasks in the service are  using.  For

                     zon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                 platformVersion -> (string)
                     The platform version that your tasks in the  service  run
                     on.  A platform version is only specified for tasks using
                     the Fargate launch type. If one isn't specified, the LAT-
                     EST  platform  version is used. For more information, see
                     Fargate Platform Versions in the Amazon Elastic Container
                     Service Developer Guide .

                 platformFamily -> (string)
                     The  operating  system that your tasks in the service, or
                     tasks are running on. A platform family is specified only
                     for tasks using the Fargate launch type.

                     All  tasks  that run as part of this service must use the
                     same platformFamily value as the  service,  for  example,
                     LINUX. .

                 networkConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The VPC subnet and security group configuration for tasks
                     that receive their own elastic network interface by using
                     the awsvpc networking mode.

                     awsvpcConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The  VPC  subnets and security groups that are associ-
                        ated with a task.

                        NOTE:
                            All specified subnets and security groups must  be
                            from the same VPC.

                        subnets -> (list)
                            The IDs of the subnets associated with the task or
                            service. There's a limit of 16 subnets that can be
                            specified per AwsVpcConfiguration .

                            NOTE:
                               All  specified  subnets  must  be from the same
                               VPC.

                            (string)

                        securityGroups -> (list)
                            The IDs of the security groups associated with the
                            task  or  service. If you don't specify a security
                            group, the default security group for the  VPC  is
                            used.  There's  a  limit of 5 security groups that
                            can be specified per AwsVpcConfiguration .

                            NOTE:
                               All specified security groups must be from  the
                               same VPC.

                            (string)

                        assignPublicIp -> (string)
                            Whether  the  task's elastic network interface re-
                            ceives a public IP address. The default  value  is
                            DISABLED .

                 rolloutState -> (string)

                     NOTE:
                        The  rolloutState  of  a  service is only returned for
                        services that use the rolling update (ECS ) deployment
                        type that aren't behind a Classic Load Balancer.

                     The  rollout  state of the deployment. When a service de-
                     ployment is started, it begins in an  IN_PROGRESS  state.
                     When  the  service reaches a steady state, the deployment
                     transitions to a COMPLETED state. If the service fails to
                     reach  a steady state and circuit breaker is enabled, the
                     deployment transitions to a FAILED state. A deployment in
                     FAILED  state  doesn't launch any new tasks. For more in-
                     formation, see  DeploymentCircuitBreaker .

                 rolloutStateReason -> (string)
                     A description of the rollout state of a deployment.

          roleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the IAM role that's associated with the  service.  It
              allows  the Amazon ECS container agent to register container in-
              stances with an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer.

          events -> (list)
              The event stream for your service. A maximum of 100 of the  lat-
              est events are displayed.

              (structure)
                 The details for an event that's associated with a service.

                 id -> (string)
                     The ID string for the event.

                 createdAt -> (timestamp)
                     The  Unix timestamp for the time when the event was trig-
                     gered.

                 message -> (string)
                     The event message.

          createdAt -> (timestamp)
              The Unix timestamp for the time when the service was created.

          placementConstraints -> (list)
              The placement constraints for the tasks in the service.

              (structure)
                 An object representing a constraint on  task  placement.  For
                 more  information, see Task Placement Constraints in the Ama-
                 zon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                 NOTE:
                     If you're using the Fargate launch type,  task  placement
                     constraints aren't supported.

                 type -> (string)
                     The  type  of  constraint. Use distinctInstance to ensure
                     that each task in a particular group is running on a dif-
                     ferent  container  instance. Use memberOf to restrict the
                     selection to a group of valid candidates.

                 expression -> (string)
                     A cluster query language expression to apply to the  con-
                     straint. The expression can have a maximum length of 2000
                     characters. You can't specify an expression if  the  con-
                     straint  type is distinctInstance . For more information,
                     see Cluster query language in  the  Amazon  Elastic  Con-
                     tainer Service Developer Guide .

          placementStrategy -> (list)
              The placement strategy that determines how tasks for the service
              are placed.

              (structure)
                 The task placement strategy for a task or service.  For  more
                 information,  see  Task  Placement  Strategies  in the Amazon
                 Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of  placement  strategy.  The  random  placement
                     strategy  randomly  places tasks on available candidates.
                     The spread placement strategy  spreads  placement  across
                     available candidates evenly based on the field parameter.
                     The binpack strategy places tasks on available candidates
                     that  have  the  least  available  amount of the resource
                     that's specified with the field parameter.  For  example,
                     if  you  binpack  on  memory, a task is placed on the in-
                     stance with the least  amount  of  remaining  memory  but
                     still enough to run the task.

                 field -> (string)
                     The  field  to  apply the placement strategy against. For
                     the spread placement strategy, valid values  are  instan-
                     ceId  (or host , which has the same effect), or any plat-
                     form or custom attribute that's applied  to  a  container
                     instance,  such  as attribute:ecs.availability-zone . For
                     the binpack placement strategy, valid values are cpu  and
                     memory . For the random placement strategy, this field is
                     not used.

          networkConfiguration -> (structure)
              The VPC subnet and security group configuration for  tasks  that
              receive  their own elastic network interface by using the awsvpc
              networking mode.

              awsvpcConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The VPC subnets and security groups that are associated  with
                 a task.

                 NOTE:
                     All  specified  subnets  and security groups must be from
                     the same VPC.

                 subnets -> (list)
                     The IDs of the subnets associated with the task  or  ser-
                     vice. There's a limit of 16 subnets that can be specified
                     per AwsVpcConfiguration .

                     NOTE:
                        All specified subnets must be from the same VPC.

                     (string)

                 securityGroups -> (list)
                     The IDs of the security groups associated with  the  task
                     or  service.  If  you don't specify a security group, the
                     default security group for the VPC  is  used.  There's  a
                     limit  of  5  security  groups  that can be specified per
                     AwsVpcConfiguration .

                     NOTE:
                        All specified security groups must be  from  the  same
                        VPC.

                     (string)

                 assignPublicIp -> (string)
                     Whether  the  task's elastic network interface receives a
                     public IP address. The default value is DISABLED .

          healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds -> (integer)
              The period of time, in seconds,  that  the  Amazon  ECS  service
              scheduler ignores unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing target health
              checks after a task has first started.

          schedulingStrategy -> (string)
              The scheduling strategy to use for the service. For more  infor-
              mation, see Services .

              There are two service scheduler strategies available.

              o REPLICA  -The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains
                the desired number of tasks across your cluster.  By  default,
                the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones.
                You can use task placement strategies and constraints to  cus-
                tomize task placement decisions.

              o DAEMON  -The  daemon  scheduling  strategy deploys exactly one
                task on each active container instance. This task meets all of
                the  task placement constraints that you specify in your clus-
                ter. The service scheduler also evaluates the  task  placement
                constraints  for  running tasks. It stop tasks that don't meet
                the placement constraints.

              NOTE:
                 Fargate tasks don't support the DAEMON scheduling strategy.

          deploymentController -> (structure)
              The deployment controller type the service is using. When  using
              the  DescribeServices  API, this field is omitted if the service
              uses the ECS deployment controller type.

              type -> (string)
                 The deployment controller type to use.

                 There are three deployment controller types available:
                     ECS

                 The rolling update (ECS ) deployment type involves  replacing
                 the  current running version of the container with the latest
                 version. The number of containers Amazon ECS adds or  removes
                 from the service during a rolling update is controlled by ad-
                 justing the minimum and maximum number of healthy  tasks  al-
                 lowed  during  a service deployment, as specified in the  De-
                 ploymentConfiguration .
                     CODE_DEPLOY

                 The  blue/green  (CODE_DEPLOY  )  deployment  type  uses  the
                 blue/green  deployment model powered by CodeDeploy, which al-
                 lows you to verify a new deployment of a service before send-
                 ing production traffic to it.
                     EXTERNAL

                 The  external  (EXTERNAL ) deployment type enables you to use
                 any third-party deployment controller for full  control  over
                 the deployment process for an Amazon ECS service.

          tags -> (list)
              The  metadata  that you apply to the service to help you catego-
              rize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key  and  an  op-
              tional value. You define bot the key and value.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

              o For  each  resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o If your tagging schema is used across  multiple  services  and
                resources,  remember that other services may have restrictions
                on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are:  let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
                lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.

              o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

              o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination
                of  such  as  a  prefix for either keys or values as it is re-
                served for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or  delete
                tag  keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do
                not count against your tags per resource limit.

              (structure)
                 The metadata that you apply to a resource to help you catego-
                 rize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an op-
                 tional value. You define them.

                 The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                 o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                 o For each resource, each tag key must be  unique,  and  each
                   tag key can have only one value.

                 o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
                   resources, remember that other services may  have  restric-
                   tions  on  allowed characters. Generally allowed characters
                   are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable  in  UTF-8,
                   and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.

                 o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                 o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combina-
                   tion of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is
                   reserved  for  Amazon  Web Services use. You cannot edit or
                   delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with  this
                   prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.

                 key -> (string)
                     One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is
                     a general label that acts like a category for  more  spe-
                     cific tag values.

                 value -> (string)
                     The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a tag.
                     A value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

          createdBy -> (string)
              The principal that created the service.

          enableECSManagedTags -> (boolean)
              Determines whether to use Amazon ECS managed tags for the  tasks
              in  the  service.  For more information, see Tagging Your Amazon
              ECS Resources in the Amazon Elastic Container Service  Developer
              Guide .

          propagateTags -> (string)
              Determines  whether  to propagate the tags from the task defini-
              tion or the service to the task. If no value is  specified,  the
              tags aren't propagated.

          enableExecuteCommand -> (boolean)
              Determines  whether the execute command functionality is enabled
              for the service. If true , the execute command functionality  is
              enabled for all containers in tasks as part of the service.
