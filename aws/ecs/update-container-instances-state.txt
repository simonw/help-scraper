NAME
       update-container-instances-state -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies the status of an Amazon ECS container instance.

       Once  a  container instance has reached an ACTIVE state, you can change
       the status of a container instance to DRAINING to  manually  remove  an
       instance  from a cluster, for example to perform system updates, update
       the Docker daemon, or scale down the cluster size.

       WARNING:
          A container instance can't be  changed  to  DRAINING  until  it  has
          reached an ACTIVE status. If the instance is in any other status, an
          error will be received.

       When you set a container instance to DRAINING , Amazon ECS prevents new
       tasks  from being scheduled for placement on the container instance and
       replacement service tasks are started on other container  instances  in
       the  cluster  if the resources are available. Service tasks on the con-
       tainer instance that are in the PENDING state are stopped immediately.

       Service tasks on the container instance that are in the  RUNNING  state
       are stopped and replaced according to the service's deployment configu-
       ration parameters, minimumHealthyPercent and maximumPercent .  You  can
       change  the  deployment configuration of your service using  UpdateSer-
       vice .

       o If minimumHealthyPercent is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore  de-
         siredCount temporarily during task replacement. For example, desired-
         Count is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the  scheduler  to  stop
         two  existing  tasks before starting two new tasks. If the minimum is
         100%, the service scheduler can't remove existing tasks until the re-
         placement  tasks  are  considered healthy. Tasks for services that do
         not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUN-
         NING  state.  Tasks for services that use a load balancer are consid-
         ered healthy if they're in the RUNNING  state  and  are  reported  as
         healthy by the load balancer..

       o The  maximumPercent parameter represents an upper limit on the number
         of running tasks during task replacement. You can use this to  define
         the  replacement  batch  size.  For  example, if desiredCount is four
         tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks  before  stopping  the
         four  tasks  to  be  drained, provided that the cluster resources re-
         quired to do this are available. If the maximum  is  100%,  then  re-
         placement tasks can't start until the draining tasks have stopped.

       Any PENDING or RUNNING tasks that do not belong to a service aren't af-
       fected. You must wait for them to finish or stop them manually.

       A container instance has completed draining when it has no more RUNNING
       tasks. You can verify this using  ListTasks .

       When a container instance has been drained, you can set a container in-
       stance to ACTIVE status and once it has reached that status the  Amazon
       ECS scheduler can begin scheduling tasks on the instance again.

SYNOPSIS
            update-container-instances-state
          [--cluster <value>]
          --container-instances <value>
          --status <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The  short  name  or  full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster
          that hosts the container instance to update. If you do not specify a
          cluster, the default cluster is assumed.

       --container-instances (list)
          A list of up to 10 container instance IDs or full ARN entries.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --status (string)
          The  container instance state to update the container instance with.
          The only valid values for this action are ACTIVE and  DRAINING  .  A
          container  instance  can  only be updated to DRAINING status once it
          has reached an ACTIVE state. If a container instance is in REGISTER-
          ING  , DEREGISTERING , or REGISTRATION_FAILED state you can describe
          the container instance  but  can't  update  the  container  instance
          state.

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o DRAINING

          o REGISTERING

          o DEREGISTERING

          o REGISTRATION_FAILED

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update the state of a container instance

       The following update-container-instances-state updates the state of the
       specified  container instance to DRAINING which will remove it from the
       cluster is it registered to.

OUTPUT
       containerInstances -> (list)
          The list of container instances.

          (structure)
              An EC2 instance that's running the Amazon ECS agent and has been
              registered with a cluster.

              containerInstanceArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the container instance. The
                 ARN contains the arn:aws:ecs namespace, followed by  the  Re-
                 gion  of  the container instance, the Amazon Web Services ac-
                 count ID of the container instance owner,  the  container-in-
                 stance namespace, and then the container instance ID. For ex-
                 ample,        arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:container-in-
                 stance/container_instance_ID .

              ec2InstanceId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of the container instance. For Amazon EC2 instances,
                 this value is the Amazon EC2 instance ID.  For  external  in-
                 stances,  this  value is the Amazon Web Services Systems Man-
                 ager managed instance ID.

              capacityProviderName -> (string)
                 The capacity provider that's associated  with  the  container
                 instance.

              version -> (long)
                 The  version counter for the container instance. Every time a
                 container instance  experiences  a  change  that  triggers  a
                 CloudWatch  event,  the  version  counter  is incremented. If
                 you're replicating your Amazon ECS container  instance  state
                 with CloudWatch Events, you can compare the version of a con-
                 tainer instance reported by the Amazon ECS APIs with the ver-
                 sion reported in CloudWatch Events for the container instance
                 (inside the detail object) to verify that the version in your
                 event stream is current.

              versionInfo -> (structure)
                 The  version  information  for the Amazon ECS container agent
                 and Docker daemon running on the container instance.

                 agentVersion -> (string)
                     The version number of the Amazon ECS container agent.

                 agentHash -> (string)
                     The Git commit hash for the Amazon  ECS  container  agent
                     build on the amazon-ecs-agent GitHub repository.

                 dockerVersion -> (string)
                     The  Docker  version  that's running on the container in-
                     stance.

              remainingResources -> (list)
                 For CPU and memory resource types, this  parameter  describes
                 the remaining CPU and memory that wasn't already allocated to
                 tasks and is therefore available for new tasks. For port  re-
                 source  types,  this  parameter describes the ports that were
                 reserved by the Amazon ECS container agent (at instance  reg-
                 istration  time)  and  any task containers that have reserved
                 port mappings on the host (with the host  or  bridge  network
                 mode).  Any  port  that's not specified here is available for
                 new tasks.

                 (structure)
                     Describes the resources available  for  a  container  in-
                     stance.

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the resource, such as CPU , MEMORY , PORTS
                        , PORTS_UDP , or a user-defined resource.

                     type -> (string)
                        The type of the resource. Valid values: INTEGER , DOU-

                     doubleValue -> (double)
                        When the doubleValue type is set, the value of the re-
                        source must be a double precision floating-point type.

                     longValue -> (long)
                        When the longValue type is set, the value of  the  re-
                        source  must  be  an extended precision floating-point
                        type.

                     integerValue -> (integer)
                        When the integerValue type is set, the  value  of  the
                        resource must be an integer.

                     stringSetValue -> (list)
                        When  the stringSetValue type is set, the value of the
                        resource must be a string type.

                        (string)

              registeredResources -> (list)
                 For CPU and memory resource types, this  parameter  describes
                 the  amount  of  each resource that was available on the con-
                 tainer instance when the container agent registered  it  with
                 Amazon ECS. This value represents the total amount of CPU and
                 memory that can be allocated on this  container  instance  to
                 tasks.  For port resource types, this parameter describes the
                 ports that were reserved by the Amazon  ECS  container  agent
                 when it registered the container instance with Amazon ECS.

                 (structure)
                     Describes  the  resources  available  for a container in-
                     stance.

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the resource, such as CPU , MEMORY , PORTS
                        , PORTS_UDP , or a user-defined resource.

                     type -> (string)
                        The type of the resource. Valid values: INTEGER , DOU-
                        BLE , LONG , or STRINGSET .

                     doubleValue -> (double)
                        When the doubleValue type is set, the value of the re-
                        source must be a double precision floating-point type.

                     longValue -> (long)
                        When  the  longValue type is set, the value of the re-
                        source must be an  extended  precision  floating-point
                        type.

                     integerValue -> (integer)
                        When  the  integerValue  type is set, the value of the
                        resource must be an integer.

                     stringSetValue -> (list)
                        When the stringSetValue type is set, the value of  the
                        resource must be a string type.

                        (string)

              status -> (string)
                 The  status  of  the container instance. The valid values are
                 REGISTERING ,  REGISTRATION_FAILED  ,  ACTIVE  ,  INACTIVE  ,
                 DEREGISTERING , or DRAINING .

                 If  your  account  has opted in to the awsvpcTrunking account
                 setting, then any newly registered  container  instance  will
                 transition  to  a  REGISTERING status while the trunk elastic
                 network interface is provisioned for  the  instance.  If  the
                 registration  fails, the instance will transition to a REGIS-
                 TRATION_FAILED status. You can  describe  the  container  in-
                 stance and see the reason for failure in the statusReason pa-
                 rameter. Once the container instance is terminated,  the  in-
                 stance  transitions to a DEREGISTERING status while the trunk
                 elastic network interface is deprovisioned. The instance then
                 transitions to an INACTIVE status.

                 The  ACTIVE  status indicates that the container instance can
                 accept tasks. The DRAINING indicates that  new  tasks  aren't
                 placed  on  the container instance and any service tasks run-
                 ning on the container instance are removed if  possible.  For
                 more information, see Container Instance Draining in the Ama-
                 zon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

              statusReason -> (string)
                 The reason that the container instance  reached  its  current
                 status.

              agentConnected -> (boolean)
                 This parameter returns true if the agent is connected to Ama-
                 zon ECS. Registered instances with an agent that may  be  un-
                 healthy or stopped return false . Only instances connected to
                 an agent can accept placement requests.

              runningTasksCount -> (integer)
                 The number of tasks on the container instance that are in the
                 RUNNING status.

              pendingTasksCount -> (integer)
                 The number of tasks on the container instance that are in the
                 PENDING status.

              agentUpdateStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the most recent  agent  update.  If  an  update
                 wasn't ever requested, this value is NULL .

              attributes -> (list)
                 The  attributes set for the container instance, either by the
                 Amazon ECS container agent at instance registration or  manu-
                 ally with the  PutAttributes operation.

                 (structure)
                     An  attribute is a name-value pair that's associated with
                     an Amazon ECS object. Use attributes to extend the Amazon
                     ECS  data  model  by  adding  custom metadata to your re-
                     sources. For more information, see Attributes in the Ama-
                     zon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                     name -> (string)
                        The  name  of the attribute. The name must contain be-
                        tween 1 and 128 characters. The name may contain  let-
                        ters  (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens (-),
                        underscores (_), forward slashes (/), back slashes (),
                        or periods (.).

                     value -> (string)
                        The value of the attribute. The value must contain be-
                        tween 1 and 128 characters.  It  can  contain  letters
                        (uppercase  and  lowercase), numbers, hyphens (-), un-
                        derscores (_), periods  (.),  at  signs  (@),  forward
                        slashes  (/),  back slashes (), colons (:), or spaces.
                        The value can't can't start or end with a space.

                     targetType -> (string)
                        The type of the target to attach the  attribute  with.
                        This  parameter  is required if you use the short form
                        ID for a resource instead of the full ARN.

                     targetId -> (string)
                        The ID of the target. You can specify the  short  form
                        ID  for  a  resource  or the full Amazon Resource Name
                        (ARN).

              attachments -> (list)
                 The resources attached to a container instance, such as elas-
                 tic network interfaces.

                 (structure)
                     An object representing a container instance or  task  at-
                     tachment.

                     id -> (string)
                        The unique identifier for the attachment.

                     type -> (string)
                        The  type of the attachment, such as ElasticNetworkIn-
                        terface .

                     status -> (string)
                        The status of the attachment. Valid values are PRECRE-
                        ATED  ,  CREATED  , ATTACHING , ATTACHED , DETACHING ,
                        DETACHED , DELETED , and FAILED .

                     details -> (list)
                        Details of the attachment. For elastic network  inter-
                        faces, this includes the network interface ID, the MAC
                        address, the subnet ID, and the private IPv4 address.

                        (structure)
                            A key-value pair object.

                            name -> (string)
                               The name of the key-value pair. For environment
                               variables,  this is the name of the environment
                               variable.

                               ronment variable.

              tags -> (list)
                 The metadata that you apply to the container instance to help
                 you  categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key
                 and an optional value. You define both.

                 The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                 o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                 o For each resource, each tag key must be  unique,  and  each
                   tag key can have only one value.

                 o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
                   resources, remember that other services may  have  restric-
                   tions  on  allowed characters. Generally allowed characters
                   are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable  in  UTF-8,
                   and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.

                 o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                 o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combina-
                   tion of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is
                   reserved  for  Amazon  Web Services use. You cannot edit or
                   delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with  this
                   prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.

                 (structure)
                     The  metadata  that  you  apply to a resource to help you

                       bination of such as a prefix for either keys or  values
                       as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You can-
                       not edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix.
                       Tags  with  this  prefix do not count against your tags
                       per resource limit.

                     key -> (string)
                        One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key
                        is  a general label that acts like a category for more
                        specific tag values.

                     value -> (string)
                        The optional part of a key-value pair that make  up  a
                        tag.  A  value acts as a descriptor within a tag cate-
                        gory (key).

                 An object representing the health status of the container in-
                 stance.

                 overallStatus -> (string)
                     The overall health status of the container instance. This
                     is an aggregate status of all container  instance  health
                     checks.

                 details -> (list)
                     An  array of objects representing the details of the con-
                     tainer instance health status.

                     (structure)
                        An object representing the result of a  container  in-
                        stance health status check.

                        type -> (string)
                            The  type of container instance health status that

                        status -> (string)
                            The container instance health status.

                        lastUpdated -> (timestamp)
                            The Unix timestamp for when the container instance
                            health status was last updated.

                        lastStatusChange -> (timestamp)
                            The Unix timestamp for when the container instance
                            health status last changed.

       failures -> (list)
          Any failures associated with the call.
