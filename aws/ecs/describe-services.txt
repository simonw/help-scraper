OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The  short  name  or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN)the cluster that
          hosts the service to describe. If you do not specify a cluster,  the
          default  cluster  is assumed. This parameter is required if the ser-
          vice or services you are describing were  launched  in  any  cluster
          other than the default cluster.

       --services (list)
          A list of services to describe. You may specify up to 10 services to
          describe in a single operation.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --include (list)
          Determines whether you want to see the resource tags  for  the  ser-
          vice.  If  TAGS is specified, the tags are included in the response.
          If this field is omitted, tags aren't included in the response.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            TAGS

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe a service

       The  following  describe-services  example  retrieves  details  for the
       my-http-service service in the default cluster.

          aws ecs describe-services --services my-http-service

OUTPUT
       services -> (list)
          The list of services described.

          (structure)
              Details on a service within a cluster.

              serviceArn -> (string)
                 The ARN that identifies the  service.  For  more  information
                 about  the  ARN format, see Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in the
                 Amazon ECS Developer Guide .

              serviceName -> (string)
                 The name of your service. Up to 255  letters  (uppercase  and
                 lowercase),  numbers,  underscores,  and hyphens are allowed.
                 Service names must be unique within a cluster.  However,  you
                 can have similarly named services in multiple clusters within
                 a Region or across multiple Regions.

              clusterArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that hosts  the
                 service.

              loadBalancers -> (list)
                 A  list  of  Elastic Load Balancing load balancer objects. It
                 contains the load balancer name, the container name, and  the
                 container  port  to  access  from the load balancer. The con-
                 tainer name is as it appears in a container definition.

                 (structure)
                     The load balancer configuration to use with a service  or
                     task set.

                     When  you add, update, or remove a load balancer configu-
                     ration, Amazon ECS starts a new deployment with  the  up-
                     dated  Elastic  Load Balancing configuration. This causes
                     tasks to register to and deregister from load balancers.

                     We recommend that you verify this on a  test  environment
                     before  you  update the Elastic Load Balancing configura-
                     tion.

                     A service-linked role is required for services  that  use
                     multiple  target  groups. For more information, see Using
                     service-linked roles in the Amazon Elastic Container Ser-
                     vice Developer Guide .

                     targetGroupArn -> (string)
                        The  full  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the Elastic
                        Load Balancing target group or groups associated  with
                        a service or task set.

                        A target group ARN is only specified when using an Ap-
                        plication Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer.

                        For services using the ECS deployment controller,  you
                        can  specify  one  or multiple target groups. For more
                        information, see Registering  multiple  target  groups
                        with a service in the Amazon Elastic Container Service
                        Developer Guide .

                        For services using  the  CODE_DEPLOY  deployment  con-
                        troller,  you're  required to define two target groups
                        for the  load  balancer.  For  more  information,  see
                        Blue/green  deployment  with  CodeDeploy in the Amazon
                        Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                        WARNING:
                            If your service's task definition uses the  awsvpc
                            network  mode,  you  must  choose ip as the target
                            type, not instance . Do this  when  creating  your
                            target  groups  because  tasks that use the awsvpc
                            network mode are associated with an  elastic  net-
                            work  interface,  not an Amazon EC2 instance. This
                            network mode is required for  the  Fargate  launch
                            type.

                     loadBalancerName -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the load balancer to associate with the
                        Amazon ECS service or task set.

                        If you are using an Application  Load  Balancer  or  a
                        Network Load Balancer the load balancer name parameter
                        should be omitted.

                     containerName -> (string)
                        The name of the container (as it  appears  in  a  con-
                        tainer  definition)  to  associate  with the load bal-
                        ancer.

                        You need to specify the container name when  configur-
                        ing the target group for an Amazon ECS load balancer.

                     containerPort -> (integer)
                        The  port  on the container to associate with the load
                        balancer. This port must correspond to a containerPort
                        in  the  task  definition the tasks in the service are
                        using. For tasks that use the  EC2  launch  type,  the
                        container  instance  they're  launched  on  must allow
                        ingress traffic on the hostPort of the port mapping.

              serviceRegistries -> (list)
                 The details for the service discovery registries to assign to
                 this service. For more information, see Service Discovery .

                 (structure)
                     The details for the service registry.

                     Each service may be associated with one service registry.
                     Multiple service registries for each service are not sup-
                     ported.

                     When  you  add,  update, or remove the service registries
                     configuration, Amazon ECS starts a  new  deployment.  New
                     tasks are registered and deregistered to the updated ser-
                     vice registry configuration.

                     registryArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  service  reg-
                        istry.  The  currently  supported  service registry is
                        Cloud Map. For more information, see CreateService .

                     port -> (integer)
                        The port value used if your service discovery  service
                        specified  an  SRV record. This field might be used if
                        both the awsvpc network mode and SRV records are used.

                     containerName -> (string)
                        The container name value to be used for  your  service
                        discovery  service. It's already specified in the task
                        definition. If the task definition that  your  service
                        task  specifies  uses the bridge or host network mode,
                        you must specify  a  containerName  and  containerPort
                        combination from the task definition. If the task def-
                        inition that your  service  task  specifies  uses  the
                        awsvpc network mode and a type SRV DNS record is used,
                        you must specify either a containerName and container-
                        Port  combination  or a port value. However, you can't
                        specify both.

                     containerPort -> (integer)
                        The port value to be used for your  service  discovery
                        service.  It's  already  specified in the task defini-
                        tion. If the task definition your service task  speci-
                        fies  uses  the  bridge or host network mode, you must
                        specify a containerName and containerPort  combination
                        from  the task definition. If the task definition your
                        service task specifies uses the  awsvpc  network  mode
                        and  a  type  SRV DNS record is used, you must specify
                        either a containerName and  containerPort  combination
                        or a port value. However, you can't specify both.

              status -> (string)
                 The  status  of  the  service.  The valid values are ACTIVE ,
                 DRAINING , or INACTIVE .

              desiredCount -> (integer)
                 The desired number of instantiations of the  task  definition
                 to  keep running on the service. This value is specified when
                 the service is created with CreateService ,  and  it  can  be
                 modified with UpdateService .

              runningCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  tasks in the cluster that are in the RUNNING
                 state.

              pendingCount -> (integer)
                 The number of tasks in the cluster that are  in  the  PENDING
                 state.

              launchType -> (string)
                 The  launch  type  the  service  is using. When using the De-
                 scribeServices API, this field is omitted if the service  was
                 created using a capacity provider strategy.

              capacityProviderStrategy -> (list)
                 The  capacity  provider strategy the service uses. When using
                 the DescribeServices API, this field is omitted if  the  ser-
                 vice was created using a launch type.

                 (structure)
                     The  details  of a capacity provider strategy. A capacity
                     provider strategy can be set when using  the  RunTask  or
                     CreateCluster  APIs  or  as the default capacity provider
                     strategy for a cluster with the CreateCluster API.

                     Only capacity providers that are already associated  with
                     a  cluster  and  have an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be
                     used   in   a    capacity    provider    strategy.    The
                     PutClusterCapacityProviders  API  is  used to associate a
                     capacity provider with a cluster.

                     If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scal-
                     ing group, the capacity provider must already be created.
                     New Auto Scaling group capacity providers can be  created
                     with the CreateClusterCapacityProvider API operation.

                     To  use  a  Fargate capacity provider, specify either the
                     FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers.  The  Fargate
                     capacity providers are available to all accounts and only
                     need to be associated with a cluster to be used in a  ca-
                     pacity provider strategy.

                     With  FARGATE_SPOT  ,  you  can run interruption tolerant
                     tasks at a rate that's discounted compared to the FARGATE
                     price. FARGATE_SPOT runs tasks on spare compute capacity.
                     When Amazon Web Services needs the  capacity  back,  your
                     tasks  are  interrupted  with  a two-minute warning. FAR-
                     GATE_SPOT supports Linux tasks with the X86_64  architec-
                     ture  on  platform  version  1.3.0 or later. FARGATE_SPOT
                     supports Linux tasks with the ARM64 architecture on plat-
                     form version 1.4.0 or later.

                     A  capacity  provider strategy may contain a maximum of 6
                     capacity providers.

                     capacityProvider -> (string)
                        The short name of the capacity provider.

                     weight -> (integer)
                        The weight value designates the relative percentage of
                        the total number of tasks launched that should use the
                        specified capacity provider. The weight value is taken
                        into  consideration  after the base value, if defined,
                        is satisfied.

                        If no weight value is specified, the default value  of
                        0 is used. When multiple capacity providers are speci-
                        fied within a capacity provider strategy, at least one
                        of  the  capacity  providers  must have a weight value
                        greater than zero and any capacity  providers  with  a
                        weight of 0 can't be used to place tasks. If you spec-
                        ify multiple capacity providers in a strategy that all
                        have  a weight of 0 , any RunTask or CreateService ac-
                        tions using the capacity provider strategy will fail.

                        An example scenario for using weights  is  defining  a
                        strategy that contains two capacity providers and both
                        have a weight of 1 , then when the base is  satisfied,
                        the tasks will be split evenly across the two capacity
                        providers. Using that same logic,  if  you  specify  a
                        weight  of  1  for capacityProviderA and a weight of 4
                        for capacityProviderB , then for every one task that's
                        run using capacityProviderA , four tasks would use ca-
                        pacityProviderB .

                     base -> (integer)
                        The base value designates how many tasks, at  a  mini-
                        mum,  to  run on the specified capacity provider. Only
                        one capacity provider in a capacity provider  strategy
                        can have a base defined. If no value is specified, the
                        default value of 0 is used.

              platformVersion -> (string)
                 The platform version to run your service on. A platform  ver-
                 sion  is only specified for tasks that are hosted on Fargate.
                 If one isn't specified, the LATEST platform version is  used.
                 For  more  information,  see Fargate Platform Versions in the
                 Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

              platformFamily -> (string)
                 The operating system that your tasks in the service run on. A
                 platform family is specified only for tasks using the Fargate
                 launch type.

                 All tasks that run as part of this service must use the  same
                 platformFamily value as the service (for example, LINUX ).

              taskDefinition -> (string)
                 The  task  definition  to  use for tasks in the service. This
                 value  is  specified  when  the  service  is   created   with
                 CreateService , and it can be modified with UpdateService .

              deploymentConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Optional  deployment  parameters  that control how many tasks
                 run during the deployment and the ordering  of  stopping  and
                 starting tasks.

                 deploymentCircuitBreaker -> (structure)

                     NOTE:
                        The  deployment  circuit  breaker can only be used for
                        services using the rolling update  (ECS  )  deployment
                        type.

                     The  deployment circuit breaker determines whether a ser-
                     vice deployment will fail if the service  can't  reach  a
                     steady  state. If you use the deployment circuit breaker,
                     a service deployment will transition to  a  failed  state
                     and stop launching new tasks. If you use the rollback op-
                     tion, when a service deployment  fails,  the  service  is
                     rolled  back  to  the last deployment that completed suc-
                     cessfully. For more information, see  Rolling  update  in
                     the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide

                     enable -> (boolean)
                        Determines  whether  to  use  the  deployment  circuit
                        breaker logic for the service.

                     rollback -> (boolean)
                        Determines whether to configure  Amazon  ECS  to  roll
                        back  the  service  if  a service deployment fails. If
                        rollback is on, when a service deployment  fails,  the
                        service  is  rolled  back  to the last deployment that
                        completed successfully.

                 maximumPercent -> (integer)
                     If a service is using the rolling update (ECS  )  deploy-
                     ment type, the maximumPercent parameter represents an up-
                     per limit on the number of your service's tasks that  are
                     allowed  in the RUNNING or PENDING state during a deploy-
                     ment, as a percentage of the desiredCount  (rounded  down
                     to  the  nearest  integer). This parameter enables you to
                     define the deployment batch size. For  example,  if  your
                     service  is using the REPLICA service scheduler and has a
                     desiredCount of four tasks and a maximumPercent value  of
                     200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stop-
                     ping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster  re-
                     sources  required  to do this are available). The default
                     maximumPercent value for a service using the REPLICA ser-
                     vice scheduler is 200%.

                     If  a service is using either the blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY
                     ) or EXTERNAL deployment types, and tasks in the  service
                     use the EC2 launch type, the maximum percent value is set
                     to the default value. The maximum percent value  is  used
                     to  define  the upper limit on the number of the tasks in
                     the service that remain in the RUNNING  state  while  the
                     container instances are in the DRAINING state.

                     NOTE:
                        You  can't specify a custom maximumPercent value for a
                        service that uses either the blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY )
                        or  EXTERNAL  deployment  types and has tasks that use
                        the EC2 launch type.

                     If the tasks in the service use the Fargate launch  type,
                     the maximum percent value is not used, although it is re-
                     turned when describing your service.

                 minimumHealthyPercent -> (integer)
                     If a service is using the rolling update (ECS  )  deploy-
                     ment  type,  the minimumHealthyPercent represents a lower
                     limit on the number of your service's tasks that must re-
                     main  in the RUNNING state during a deployment, as a per-
                     centage of the desiredCount (rounded up  to  the  nearest
                     integer).  This  parameter  enables you to deploy without
                     using additional cluster capacity. For example,  if  your
                     service  has  a  desiredCount  of  four tasks and a mini-
                     mumHealthyPercent of 50%, the service scheduler may  stop
                     two  existing  tasks  to  free up cluster capacity before
                     starting two new tasks.

                     For services that do not use a load balancer, the follow-
                     ing should be noted:

                     o A  service  is considered healthy if all essential con-
                       tainers within the tasks  in  the  service  pass  their
                       health checks.

                     o If  a  task  has  no essential containers with a health
                       check defined, the service scheduler will wait  for  40
                       seconds after a task reaches a RUNNING state before the
                       task is counted towards the minimum healthy percent to-
                       tal.

                     o If  a  task has one or more essential containers with a
                       health check defined, the service scheduler  will  wait
                       for  the task to reach a healthy status before counting
                       it towards the minimum healthy percent total. A task is
                       considered healthy when all essential containers within
                       the task have passed their health checks. The amount of
                       time  the  service scheduler can wait for is determined
                       by the container health check settings.

                     For services that do use a load balancer,  the  following
                     should be noted:

                     o If  a  task  has  no essential containers with a health
                       check defined, the service scheduler will wait for  the
                       load  balancer  target  group  health check to return a
                       healthy status before counting  the  task  towards  the
                       minimum healthy percent total.

                     o If  a  task  has  an  essential container with a health
                       check defined, the service scheduler will wait for both
                       the  task  to  reach a healthy status and the load bal-
                       ancer target group health check  to  return  a  healthy
                       status  before  counting  the  task towards the minimum
                       healthy percent total.

                     The  default  value  for  a  replica  service  for  mini-
                     mumHealthyPercent is 100%. The default minimumHealthyPer-
                     cent value for a service using the DAEMON service  sched-
                     ule  is 0% for the CLI, the Amazon Web Services SDKs, and
                     the APIs and 50% for the Amazon Web  Services  Management
                     Console.

                     The  minimum  number of healthy tasks during a deployment
                     is the desiredCount multiplied by the  minimumHealthyPer-
                     cent /100, rounded up to the nearest integer value.

                     If  a service is using either the blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY
                     ) or EXTERNAL deployment types and is running tasks  that
                     use  the  EC2  launch  type,  the minimum healthy percent
                     value is set to the default value.  The  minimum  healthy
                     percent  value  is  used to define the lower limit on the
                     number of the tasks in the service  that  remain  in  the
                     RUNNING  state  while  the container instances are in the
                     DRAINING state.

                     NOTE:
                        You can't specify a custom minimumHealthyPercent value
                        for   a   service  that  uses  either  the  blue/green
                        (CODE_DEPLOY ) or EXTERNAL deployment  types  and  has
                        tasks that use the EC2 launch type.

                     If  a service is using either the blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY
                     ) or EXTERNAL deployment types and is running tasks  that
                     use  the Fargate launch type, the minimum healthy percent
                     value is not used, although it is returned when  describ-
                     ing your service.

                 alarms -> (structure)
                     Information about the CloudWatch alarms.

                     alarmNames -> (list)
                        One or more CloudWatch alarm names. Use a "," to sepa-
                        rate the alarms.

                        (string)

                     rollback -> (boolean)
                        Determines whether to configure  Amazon  ECS  to  roll
                        back  the  service  if  a service deployment fails. If
                        rollback is used, when a service deployment fails, the
                        service  is  rolled  back  to the last deployment that
                        completed successfully.

                     enable -> (boolean)
                        Determines whether to use the CloudWatch alarm  option
                        in the service deployment process.

              taskSets -> (list)
                 Information about a set of Amazon ECS tasks in either an Cod-
                 eDeploy or an EXTERNAL deployment. An Amazon ECS task set in-
                 cludes  details such as the desired number of tasks, how many
                 tasks are running, and whether the task set serves production
                 traffic.

                 (structure)
                     Information  about a set of Amazon ECS tasks in either an
                     CodeDeploy or an EXTERNAL deployment. An Amazon ECS  task
                     set includes details such as the desired number of tasks,
                     how many tasks are running,  and  whether  the  task  set
                     serves production traffic.

                     id -> (string)
                        The ID of the task set.

                     taskSetArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task set.

                     serviceArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service the task
                        set exists in.

                     clusterArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that the
                        service that hosts the task set exists in.

                     startedBy -> (string)
                        The  tag  specified  when a task set is started. If an
                        CodeDeploy deployment created the task set, the start-
                        edBy parameter is CODE_DEPLOY . If an external deploy-
                        ment created the task set, the startedBy  field  isn't
                        used.

                     externalId -> (string)
                        The external ID associated with the task set.

                        If  an  CodeDeploy  deployment created a task set, the
                        externalId parameter contains the  CodeDeploy  deploy-
                        ment ID.

                        If  a  task  set is created for an external deployment
                        and is associated with a service  discovery  registry,
                        the externalId parameter contains the ECS_TASK_SET_EX-
                        TERNAL_ID Cloud Map attribute.

                     status -> (string)
                        The status of the task set.  The  following  describes
                        each state.
                            PRIMARY

                        The task set is serving production traffic.
                            ACTIVE

                        The task set isn't serving production traffic.
                            DRAINING

                        The tasks in the task set are being stopped, and their
                        corresponding  targets  are  being  deregistered  from
                        their target group.

                     taskDefinition -> (string)
                        The task definition that the task set is using.

                     computedDesiredCount -> (integer)
                        The  computed  desired count for the task set. This is
                        calculated by multiplying the  service's  desiredCount
                        by  the task set's scale percentage. The result is al-
                        ways rounded up. For example, if the computed  desired
                        count is 1.2, it rounds up to 2 tasks.

                     pendingCount -> (integer)
                        The  number  of  tasks in the task set that are in the
                        PENDING status during a  deployment.  A  task  in  the
                        PENDING state is preparing to enter the RUNNING state.
                        A task set enters the PENDING status when it  launches
                        for  the first time or when it's restarted after being
                        in the STOPPED state.

                     runningCount -> (integer)
                        The number of tasks in the task set that  are  in  the
                        RUNNING status during a deployment. A task in the RUN-
                        NING state is running and ready for use.

                     createdAt -> (timestamp)
                        The Unix timestamp for the time when the task set  was
                        created.

                     updatedAt -> (timestamp)
                        The  Unix timestamp for the time when the task set was
                        last updated.

                     launchType -> (string)
                        The launch type the tasks in the task set  are  using.
                        For  more  information, see Amazon ECS launch types in
                        the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                     capacityProviderStrategy -> (list)
                        The capacity provider  strategy  that  are  associated
                        with the task set.

                        (structure)
                            The details of a capacity provider strategy. A ca-
                            pacity provider strategy can be set when using the
                            RunTask  or  CreateCluster  APIs or as the default
                            capacity provider strategy for a cluster with  the
                            CreateCluster API.

                            Only  capacity  providers that are already associ-
                            ated with a cluster and have an ACTIVE or UPDATING
                            status  can  be used in a capacity provider strat-
                            egy. The PutClusterCapacityProviders API  is  used
                            to associate a capacity provider with a cluster.

                            If  specifying  a  capacity  provider that uses an
                            Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must al-
                            ready  be created. New Auto Scaling group capacity
                            providers    can    be    created     with     the
                            CreateClusterCapacityProvider API operation.

                            To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either
                            the FARGATE or  FARGATE_SPOT  capacity  providers.
                            The  Fargate  capacity  providers are available to
                            all accounts and only need to be associated with a
                            cluster  to  be used in a capacity provider strat-
                            egy.

                            With FARGATE_SPOT , you can run interruption  tol-
                            erant  tasks  at a rate that's discounted compared
                            to the FARGATE price. FARGATE_SPOT runs  tasks  on
                            spare  compute  capacity. When Amazon Web Services
                            needs the capacity back,  your  tasks  are  inter-
                            rupted  with  a  two-minute  warning. FARGATE_SPOT
                            supports Linux tasks with the X86_64  architecture
                            on  platform  version 1.3.0 or later. FARGATE_SPOT
                            supports Linux tasks with the  ARM64  architecture
                            on platform version 1.4.0 or later.

                            A capacity provider strategy may contain a maximum
                            of 6 capacity providers.

                            capacityProvider -> (string)
                               The short name of the capacity provider.

                            weight -> (integer)
                               The weight value designates the  relative  per-
                               centage  of  the total number of tasks launched
                               that  should   use   the   specified   capacity
                               provider.  The  weight value is taken into con-
                               sideration after the base value, if defined, is
                               satisfied.

                               If  no  weight  value is specified, the default
                               value of 0  is  used.  When  multiple  capacity
                               providers   are  specified  within  a  capacity
                               provider strategy, at least one of the capacity
                               providers must have a weight value greater than
                               zero and any capacity providers with  a  weight
                               of 0 can't be used to place tasks. If you spec-
                               ify multiple capacity providers in  a  strategy
                               that  all  have  a weight of 0 , any RunTask or
                               CreateService  actions   using   the   capacity
                               provider strategy will fail.

                               An example scenario for using weights is defin-
                               ing  a  strategy  that  contains  two  capacity
                               providers  and  both  have a weight of 1 , then
                               when the base is satisfied, the tasks  will  be
                               split evenly across the two capacity providers.
                               Using that same logic, if you specify a  weight
                               of  1  for  capacityProviderA and a weight of 4
                               for capacityProviderB , then for every one task
                               that's run using capacityProviderA , four tasks
                               would use capacityProviderB .

                            base -> (integer)
                               The base value designates how many tasks, at  a
                               minimum,  to  run  on  the  specified  capacity
                               provider. Only one capacity provider in  a  ca-
                               pacity  provider  strategy  can have a base de-
                               fined. If no value is  specified,  the  default
                               value of 0 is used.

                     platformVersion -> (string)
                        The  Fargate  platform  version where the tasks in the
                        task set are running. A platform version is only spec-
                        ified  for tasks run on Fargate. For more information,
                        see Fargate platform versions in  the  Amazon  Elastic
                        Container Service Developer Guide .

                     platformFamily -> (string)
                        The  operating  system  that your tasks in the set are
                        running on. A platform family is  specified  only  for
                        tasks that use the Fargate launch type.

                        All tasks in the set must have the same value.

                     networkConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The network configuration for the task set.

                        awsvpcConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The VPC subnets and security groups that are asso-
                            ciated with a task.

                            NOTE:
                               All specified subnets and security groups  must
                               be from the same VPC.

                            subnets -> (list)
                               The IDs of the subnets associated with the task
                               or service. There's a limit of 16 subnets  that
                               can be specified per awsvpcConfiguration .

                               NOTE:
                                   All specified subnets must be from the same
                                   VPC.

                               (string)

                            securityGroups -> (list)
                               The IDs of the security groups associated  with
                               the task or service. If you don't specify a se-
                               curity group, the default  security  group  for
                               the  VPC is used. There's a limit of 5 security
                               groups that can be specified per awsvpcConfigu-
                               ration .

                               NOTE:
                                   All  specified security groups must be from
                                   the same VPC.

                               (string)

                            assignPublicIp -> (string)
                               Whether the task's  elastic  network  interface
                               receives a public IP address. The default value
                               is DISABLED .

                     loadBalancers -> (list)
                        Details on a load balancer that are used with  a  task
                        set.

                        (structure)
                            The load balancer configuration to use with a ser-
                            vice or task set.

                            When you add, update, or remove  a  load  balancer
                            configuration,  Amazon ECS starts a new deployment
                            with the updated Elastic Load Balancing configura-
                            tion.  This causes tasks to register to and dereg-
                            ister from load balancers.

                            We recommend that you verify this on a test  envi-
                            ronment before you update the Elastic Load Balanc-
                            ing configuration.

                            A service-linked role  is  required  for  services

                            targetGroupArn -> (string)
                               The  full  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the
                               Elastic Load Balancing target group  or  groups
                               associated with a service or task set.

                               A target group ARN is only specified when using
                               an Application Load Balancer  or  Network  Load
                               Balancer.

                                   work  mode  is  required  for  the  Fargate
                                   launch type.

                            loadBalancerName -> (string)
                               The name of the load balancer to associate with
                               the Amazon ECS service or task set.

                               If you are using an Application  Load  Balancer
                               or  a  Network  Load Balancer the load balancer
                               name parameter should be omitted.

                            containerName -> (string)
                               The name of the container (as it appears  in  a
                               container  definition)  to  associate  with the
                               load balancer.

                               You need to specify  the  container  name  when
                               configuring  the target group for an Amazon ECS
                               load balancer.

                            containerPort -> (integer)
                               The port on the container to associate with the
                               load  balancer.  This port must correspond to a
                               containerPort in the task definition the  tasks
                               in  the  service  are using. For tasks that use
                               the EC2 launch  type,  the  container  instance
                               they're  launched on must allow ingress traffic
                               on the hostPort of the port mapping.

                     serviceRegistries -> (list)
                        The details for the service  discovery  registries  to
                        assign  to  this  task  set. For more information, see
                        Service discovery .

                        (structure)
                            The details for the service registry.

                            Each service may be associated  with  one  service
                            registry.  Multiple  service  registries  for each
                            service are not supported.

                            When you add, update, or remove the  service  reg-
                            istries configuration, Amazon ECS starts a new de-
                            ployment. New tasks are  registered  and  deregis-
                            tered  to  the updated service registry configura-
                            tion.

                            registryArn -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  service
                               registry.  The currently supported service reg-
                               istry is Cloud Map. For more  information,  see
                               CreateService .

                            port -> (integer)
                               The  port  value used if your service discovery
                               service specified an  SRV  record.  This  field
                               might  be  used if both the awsvpc network mode
                               and SRV records are used.

                            containerName -> (string)
                               The container name value to be  used  for  your
                               service  discovery service. It's already speci-
                               fied in the task definition. If the task  defi-
                               nition  that  your  service task specifies uses
                               the bridge or host network mode, you must spec-
                               ify  a containerName and containerPort combina-
                               tion from the task definition. If the task def-
                               inition  that  your service task specifies uses
                               the awsvpc network mode  and  a  type  SRV  DNS
                               record  is used, you must specify either a con-
                               tainerName and containerPort combination  or  a
                               port value. However, you can't specify both.

                            containerPort -> (integer)
                               The port value to be used for your service dis-
                               covery service. It's already specified  in  the
                               task  definition.  If  the task definition your
                               service task specifies uses the bridge or  host
                               network  mode, you must specify a containerName
                               and containerPort  combination  from  the  task
                               definition. If the task definition your service
                               task specifies uses the awsvpc network mode and
                               a type SRV DNS record is used, you must specify
                               either a containerName and containerPort combi-
                               nation  or  a  port  value.  However, you can't
                               specify both.

                     scale -> (structure)
                        A floating-point percentage of your desired number  of
                        tasks to place and keep running in the task set.

                        value -> (double)
                            The  value, specified as a percent total of a ser-
                            vice's desiredCount , to scale the task  set.  Ac-
                            cepted values are numbers between 0 and 100.

                        unit -> (string)
                            The unit of measure for the scale value.

                     stabilityStatus -> (string)
                        The  stability status. This indicates whether the task
                        set has reached a steady state. If the following  con-
                        ditions are met, the task set are in STEADY_STATE :

                        o The  task  runningCount  is equal to the computedDe-
                          siredCount .

                        o The pendingCount is 0 .

                        o There are no tasks that are running on container in-
                          stances in the DRAINING status.

                        o All  tasks  are  reporting a healthy status from the
                          load balancers,  service  discovery,  and  container
                          health checks.

                        If  any  of those conditions aren't met, the stability
                        status returns STABILIZING .

                     stabilityStatusAt -> (timestamp)
                        The Unix timestamp for the time when the task set sta-
                        bility status was retrieved.

                     tags -> (list)
                        The  metadata  that  you apply to the task set to help
                        you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of
                        a key and an optional value. You define both.

                        The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                        o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                        o For  each resource, each tag key must be unique, and
                          each tag key can have only one value.

                        o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                        o Maximum value length -  256  Unicode  characters  in
                          UTF-8

                        o If  your tagging schema is used across multiple ser-
                          vices and resources, remember  that  other  services
                          may  have restrictions on allowed characters. Gener-
                          ally allowed characters are: letters,  numbers,  and
                          spaces  representable  in  UTF-8,  and the following
                          characters: + - = . _ : / @.

                        o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                        o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper  or  lowercase
                          combination  of  such as a prefix for either keys or
                          values as it is reserved  for  Amazon  Web  Services
                          use.  You  cannot  edit or delete tag keys or values
                          with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count
                          against your tags per resource limit.

                        (structure)
                            The  metadata that you apply to a resource to help
                            you categorize and organize them.  Each  tag  con-
                            sists  of  a key and an optional value. You define
                            them.

                            The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                            o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                              ters. Generally allowed characters are: letters,
                              numbers,  and spaces representable in UTF-8, and
                              the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.

                            o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                            o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or  lower-
                              case  combination of such as a prefix for either
                              keys or values as it is reserved for Amazon  Web
                              Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys
                              or values with this prefix. Tags with this  pre-
                              fix  do not count against your tags per resource
                              limit.

                            key -> (string)
                               One part of a key-value pair  that  make  up  a
                               tag.  A key is a general label that acts like a
                               category for more specific tag values.

                            value -> (string)
                               The optional part of a key-value pair that make
                               up a tag. A value acts as a descriptor within a
                               tag category (key).

                     fargateEphemeralStorage -> (structure)

                     status -> (string)
                        The status of the deployment. The following  describes
                        each state.
                            PRIMARY

                        The most recent deployment of a service.
                            ACTIVE

                        A service deployment that still has running tasks, but
                        are in the process of being replaced with a  new  PRI-
                        MARY deployment.
                            INACTIVE

                        A deployment that has been completely replaced.

                     taskDefinition -> (string)
                        The most recent task definition that was specified for
                        the tasks in the service to use.

                     desiredCount -> (integer)
                        The most recent desired count of tasks that was speci-

                     failedTasks -> (integer)
                        The  number  of  consecutively failed tasks in the de-
                        ployment. A task is considered a failure if  the  ser-
                        vice scheduler can't launch the task, the task doesn't
                        transition to a RUNNING state, or if it fails  any  of
                        its defined health checks and is stopped.

                        NOTE:
                            Once a service deployment has one or more success-
                            fully running tasks, the failed task count  resets
                            to zero and stops being evaluated.

                     capacityProviderStrategy -> (list)
                        The  capacity provider strategy that the deployment is
                        using.

                        (structure)
                            The details of a capacity provider strategy. A ca-
                            pacity provider strategy can be set when using the
                            RunTask or CreateCluster APIs or  as  the  default
                            capacity  provider strategy for a cluster with the
                            CreateCluster API.

                            Only capacity providers that are  already  associ-
                            ated with a cluster and have an ACTIVE or UPDATING
                            status can be used in a capacity  provider  strat-
                            egy.  The  PutClusterCapacityProviders API is used
                            to associate a capacity provider with a cluster.

                            If specifying a capacity  provider  that  uses  an
                            Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must al-
                            ready be created. New Auto Scaling group  capacity
                            providers     can     be    created    with    the
                            CreateClusterCapacityProvider API operation.

                            To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either
                            the  FARGATE  or  FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers.
                            The Fargate capacity providers  are  available  to
                            all accounts and only need to be associated with a
                            cluster to be used in a capacity  provider  strat-
                            egy.

                            With  FARGATE_SPOT , you can run interruption tol-
                            erant tasks at a rate that's  discounted  compared
                            to  the  FARGATE price. FARGATE_SPOT runs tasks on
                            spare compute capacity. When Amazon  Web  Services
                            needs  the  capacity  back,  your tasks are inter-
                            rupted with  a  two-minute  warning.  FARGATE_SPOT
                            supports  Linux tasks with the X86_64 architecture
                            on platform version 1.3.0 or  later.  FARGATE_SPOT
                            supports  Linux  tasks with the ARM64 architecture
                            on platform version 1.4.0 or later.

                            A capacity provider strategy may contain a maximum
                            of 6 capacity providers.

                            capacityProvider -> (string)
                               The short name of the capacity provider.

                            weight -> (integer)
                               The  weight  value designates the relative per-
                               centage of the total number of  tasks  launched
                               that   should   use   the   specified  capacity
                               provider. The weight value is taken  into  con-
                               sideration after the base value, if defined, is
                               satisfied.

                               If no weight value is  specified,  the  default
                               value  of  0  is  used.  When multiple capacity
                               providers  are  specified  within  a   capacity
                               provider strategy, at least one of the capacity
                               providers must have a weight value greater than
                               zero  and  any capacity providers with a weight
                               of 0 can't be used to place tasks. If you spec-
                               ify  multiple  capacity providers in a strategy
                               that all have a weight of 0 ,  any  RunTask  or
                               CreateService   actions   using   the  capacity
                               provider strategy will fail.

                               An example scenario for using weights is defin-
                               ing  a  strategy  that  contains  two  capacity
                               providers and both have a weight of  1  ,  then
                               when  the  base is satisfied, the tasks will be
                               split evenly across the two capacity providers.
                               Using  that same logic, if you specify a weight
                               of 1 for capacityProviderA and a  weight  of  4
                               for capacityProviderB , then for every one task
                               that's run using capacityProviderA , four tasks
                               would use capacityProviderB .

                            base -> (integer)
                               The  base value designates how many tasks, at a
                               minimum,  to  run  on  the  specified  capacity
                               provider.  Only  one capacity provider in a ca-
                               pacity provider strategy can have  a  base  de-
                               fined.  If  no  value is specified, the default
                               value of 0 is used.

                     launchType -> (string)
                        The launch type the tasks in the  service  are  using.
                        For  more  information, see Amazon ECS Launch Types in
                        the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                     platformVersion -> (string)
                        The platform version that your tasks  in  the  service
                        run on. A platform version is only specified for tasks
                        using the Fargate launch type. If one isn't specified,
                        the LATEST platform version is used. For more informa-
                        tion, see Fargate  Platform  Versions  in  the  Amazon
                        Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                     platformFamily -> (string)
                        The  operating  system that your tasks in the service,
                        or tasks are running on. A platform family  is  speci-
                        fied only for tasks using the Fargate launch type.

                        All  tasks  that  run as part of this service must use
                        the same platformFamily value as the service, for  ex-
                        ample, LINUX. .

                     networkConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The  VPC  subnet  and security group configuration for
                        tasks that receive their own elastic network interface
                        by using the awsvpc networking mode.

                        awsvpcConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The VPC subnets and security groups that are asso-
                            ciated with a task.

                            NOTE:
                               All specified subnets and security groups  must
                               be from the same VPC.

                            subnets -> (list)
                               The IDs of the subnets associated with the task
                               or service. There's a limit of 16 subnets  that
                               can be specified per awsvpcConfiguration .

                               NOTE:
                                   All specified subnets must be from the same
                                   VPC.

                               (string)

                            securityGroups -> (list)
                               The IDs of the security groups associated  with
                               the task or service. If you don't specify a se-
                               curity group, the default  security  group  for
                               the  VPC is used. There's a limit of 5 security
                               groups that can be specified per awsvpcConfigu-
                               ration .

                               NOTE:
                                   All  specified security groups must be from
                                   the same VPC.

                               (string)

                            assignPublicIp -> (string)
                               Whether the task's  elastic  network  interface
                               receives a public IP address. The default value
                               is DISABLED .

                     rolloutState -> (string)

                        NOTE:
                            The rolloutState of a service is only returned for
                            services  that  use  the rolling update (ECS ) de-
                            ployment type that aren't behind  a  Classic  Load
                            Balancer.

                        The  rollout  state  of the deployment. When a service
                        deployment is started, it  begins  in  an  IN_PROGRESS
                        state.  When  the  service reaches a steady state, the
                        deployment transitions to a COMPLETED  state.  If  the
                        service  fails  to  reach  a  steady state and circuit
                        breaker is turned on, the deployment transitions to  a
                        FAILED  state.  A  deployment  in FAILED state doesn't
                        launch  any  new  tasks.  For  more  information,  see
                        DeploymentCircuitBreaker .

                     rolloutStateReason -> (string)
                        A description of the rollout state of a deployment.

                     serviceConnectConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The  details  of  the  Service  Connect  configuration
                        that's used by this deployment. Compare the configura-
                        tion between multiple deployments when troubleshooting
                        issues with new deployments.

                        The configuration for this  service  to  discover  and
                        connect  to  services,  and be discovered by, and con-
                        nected from, other services within a namespace.

                        Tasks that run in a namespace can use short  names  to
                        connect  to  services in the namespace. Tasks can con-
                        nect to services across all of  the  clusters  in  the
                        namespace.  Tasks connect through a managed proxy con-
                        tainer that collects logs and  metrics  for  increased
                        visibility.  Only  the  tasks that Amazon ECS services
                        create are supported with Service  Connect.  For  more
                        information, see Service Connect in the Amazon Elastic
                        Container Service Developer Guide .

                        enabled -> (boolean)
                            Specifies whether to use Service Connect with this
                            service.

                        namespace -> (string)
                            The  namespace  name  or full Amazon Resource Name
                            (ARN) of the Cloud Map namespace for use with Ser-
                            vice  Connect.  The  namespace must be in the same
                            Amazon Web Services Region as the Amazon ECS  ser-
                            vice  and  cluster.  The type of namespace doesn't
                            affect Service Connect. For more information about
                            Cloud  Map, see Working with Services in the Cloud
                            Map Developer Guide .

                        services -> (list)
                            The list of Service Connect service objects. These
                            are  names  and  aliases (also known as endpoints)
                            that are used by other Amazon ECS services to con-
                            nect to this service.

                            This  field  is not required for a "client" Amazon
                            ECS service that's a member of a namespace only to
                            connect to other services within the namespace. An
                            example of this would be  a  frontend  application
                            that  accepts incoming requests from either a load
                            balancer that's attached  to  the  service  or  by
                            other means.

                            An object selects a port from the task definition,
                            assigns a name for the Cloud Map  service,  and  a
                            list  of  aliases (endpoints) and ports for client
                            applications to refer to this service.

                            (structure)
                               The Service Connect service  object  configura-
                               tion. For more information, see Service Connect

                               portName -> (string)
                                   The  portName must match the name of one of
                                   the portMappings from all the containers in
                                   the task definition of this Amazon ECS ser-

                               discoveryName -> (string)
                                   The discoveryName is the name  of  the  new
                                   Cloud  Map  service that Amazon ECS creates
                                   for this Amazon ECS service. This  must  be
                                   unique  within the Cloud Map namespace. The
                                   name can contain up to 64  characters.  The
                                   name  can  include  lowercase letters, num-
                                   bers, underscores (_), and hyphens (-). The
                                   name can't start with a hyphen.

                                   If  the  discoveryName isn't specified, the
                                   port mapping name from the task  definition
                                   is used in portName.namespace .

                               clientAliases -> (list)
                                   The list of client aliases for this Service
                                   Connect service. You use  these  to  assign
                                   names  that  can be used by client applica-
                                   tions. The maximum number of client aliases
                                   that you can have in this list is 1.

                                   Each  alias  ("endpoint") is a fully-quali-
                                   fied name and port number that other Amazon
                                   ECS tasks ("clients") can use to connect to
                                   this service.

                                   Each name and port mapping must  be  unique
                                   within the namespace.

                                   For  each  ServiceConnectService , you must
                                   provide at least one clientAlias  with  one
                                   port .

                                   (structure)
                                      Each alias ("endpoint") is a fully-qual-
                                      ified name and port  number  that  other
                                      tasks  ("clients") can use to connect to
                                      this service.

                                      Each  name  and  port  mapping  must  be
                                      unique within the namespace.

                                      Tasks  that  run  in a namespace can use
                                      short names to connect  to  services  in
                                      the namespace. Tasks can connect to ser-
                                      vices across all of the clusters in  the
                                      namespace.  Tasks connect through a man-
                                      aged proxy container that collects  logs
                                      and  metrics  for  increased visibility.
                                      Only the tasks that Amazon ECS  services
                                      create  are  supported with Service Con-
                                      nect. For more information, see  Service

                                      port -> (integer)
                                          The listening port  number  for  the
                                          Service  Connect proxy. This port is
                                          available inside of all of the tasks
                                          within the same namespace.

                                          in client Amazon ECS  services,  set
                                          this  to  the  same  port  that  the
                                          client application uses by  default.

                                          The dnsName is the name that you use
                                          in the applications of client  tasks
                                          to connect to this service. The name
                                          must be a valid DNS name but doesn't
                                          need to be fully-qualified. The name
                                          can include up  to  127  characters.
                                          The  name can include lowercase let-
                                          ters, numbers, underscores (_),  hy-
                                          phens (-), and periods (.). The name
                                          can't start with a hyphen.

                                          If this parameter  isn't  specified,
                                          the   default  value  of  discovery-
                                          Name.namespace is used. If the  dis-

                               ingressPortOverride -> (integer)
                                   The  port  number  for  the Service Connect
                                   proxy to listen on.

                                   fied in the named portMapping in  the  task
                                   definition  of  this  application, and then
                                   use it in your VPC security groups to allow
                                   traffic  into the proxy for this Amazon ECS
                                   service.

                                   In awsvpc mode  and  Fargate,  the  default
                                   value  is  the  container  port number. The
                                   container port number is in the portMapping
                                   in the task definition. In bridge mode, the
                                   default value is the ephemeral port of  the
                                   Service Connect proxy.

                               timeout -> (structure)

                                   idleTimeoutSeconds -> (integer)
                                      The  amount of time in seconds a connec-
                                      tion will  stay  active  while  idle.  A
                                      value  of  0 can be set to disable idle-
                                      Timeout .

                                      The idleTimeout default for HTTP  /HTTP2
                                      /GRPC is 5 minutes.

                                      The  idleTimeout  default  for  TCP is 1
                                      hour.

                                   perRequestTimeoutSeconds -> (integer)
                                      The amount of time waiting for  the  up-
                                      stream  to  respond  with a complete re-

                                      awsPcaAuthorityArn -> (string)
                                          The  ARN  of the Amazon Web Services

                        logConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The log configuration for the container. This  pa-
                            rameter  maps to LogConfig in the docker container
                            create command  and  the  --log-driver  option  to
                            docker run.

                            By default, containers use the same logging driver
                            that the Docker daemon  uses.  However,  the  con-
                            tainer  might  use a different logging driver than
                            the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver  con-
                            figuration in the container definition.

                            Understand  the  following  when  specifying a log
                            configuration for your containers.

                            o Amazon ECS currently supports a  subset  of  the
                              logging  drivers available to the Docker daemon.
                              Additional log drivers may be available  in  fu-
                              ture releases of the Amazon ECS container agent.
                              For tasks on Fargate, the supported log  drivers
                              are  awslogs  ,  splunk  , and awsfirelens . For
                              tasks hosted on Amazon EC2 instances,  the  sup-
                              ported  log drivers are awslogs , fluentd , gelf
                              , json-file , journald ,``syslog``  ,  splunk  ,
                              and awsfirelens .

                            o This  parameter  requires  version  1.18  of the
                              Docker Remote API or greater on  your  container
                              instance.

                            o For  tasks  that  are  hosted  on Amazon EC2 in-
                              stances, the Amazon  ECS  container  agent  must
                              register  the available logging drivers with the
                              ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS environment  vari-
                              able  before  containers placed on that instance
                              can use these  log  configuration  options.  For
                              more information, see Amazon ECS container agent
                              configuration in the  Amazon  Elastic  Container

                            o For tasks that are on Fargate, because you don't
                              have access  to  the  underlying  infrastructure
                              your  tasks  are hosted on, any additional soft-
                              ware needed must be  installed  outside  of  the
                              task.  For  example, the Fluentd output aggrega-
                              tors or a remote host running Logstash  to  send
                              Gelf logs to.

                            logDriver -> (string)
                               The log driver to use for the container.

                               For tasks on Fargate, the supported log drivers
                               are awslogs , splunk , and awsfirelens .

                               For tasks hosted on Amazon EC2  instances,  the
                               supported  log  drivers are awslogs , fluentd ,
                               gelf , json-file , journald , syslog , splunk ,
                               and awsfirelens .

                                   If  you  have  a  custom  driver that isn't
                                   listed, you can fork the  Amazon  ECS  con-
                                   tainer  agent  project  that's available on
                                   GitHub and customize it to work  with  that
                                   driver. We encourage you to submit pull re-
                                   quests for changes that you would  like  to
                                   have  included. However, we don't currently
                                   provide support for running modified copies
                                   of this software.

                               The  configuration  options  to send to the log
                               driver.

                               The options you can specify depend on  the  log
                               driver.  Some  of  the  options you can specify
                               when you use the awslogs log  driver  to  route
                               logs  to  Amazon CloudWatch include the follow-
                               ing:
                                   awslogs-create-group

                               Required: No

                               Specify whether you want the log  group  to  be
                               created  automatically.  If  this  option isn't
                               specified, it defaults to false .

                               NOTE:
                                   Your IAM policy must include the  logs:Cre-
                                   ateLogGroup  permission  before you attempt
                                   to use awslogs-create-group .

                                   awslogs-region

                               Required: Yes

                               Specify the Amazon Web Services Region that the
                               awslogs  log driver is to send your Docker logs
                               to. You can choose to send  all  of  your  logs
                               from  clusters in different Regions to a single
                               region in CloudWatch  Logs.  This  is  so  that
                               they're all visible in one location. Otherwise,
                               you can separate them by Region for more granu-
                               larity.  Make sure that the specified log group
                               exists in the Region that you specify with this
                               option.
                                   awslogs-group

                               Required: Yes

                               Make  sure  to  specify  a  log  group that the
                               awslogs log driver sends its log streams to.
                                   awslogs-stream-prefix

                               Required: Yes, when using  the  Fargate  launch
                               type.Optional for the EC2 launch type, required
                               for the Fargate launch type.

                               Use the awslogs-stream-prefix option  to  asso-
                               ciate  a  log stream with the specified prefix,
                               the container name, and the ID  of  the  Amazon
                               ECS  task that the container belongs to. If you
                               specify a prefix with this option, then the log
                               stream   takes   the   format  prefix-name/con-
                               tainer-name/ecs-task-id .

                               If you don't specify a prefix with this option,
                               then  the  log  stream  is named after the con-
                               tainer ID that's assigned by the Docker  daemon
                               on  the container instance. Because it's diffi-
                               cult to trace logs back to the  container  that
                               sent  them  with  just  the Docker container ID
                               (which is only available on the  container  in-
                               stance), we recommend that you specify a prefix
                               with this option.

                               For Amazon ECS services, you can use  the  ser-
                               vice  name  as  the  prefix.  Doing so, you can
                               trace log streams to the service that the  con-
                               tainer  belongs  to,  the name of the container
                               that sent them, and the ID of the task that the
                               container belongs to.

                               You  must specify a stream-prefix for your logs
                               to have your logs appear in the Log  pane  when
                               using the Amazon ECS console.
                                   awslogs-datetime-format

                               Required: No

                               This  option  defines a multiline start pattern
                               in Python strftime format. A log  message  con-
                               sists  of  a  line that matches the pattern and
                               any following lines that dont  match  the  pat-
                               tern. The matched line is the delimiter between
                               log messages.

                               One example of a use case for using this format
                               is  for  parsing  output  such as a stack dump,
                               which might otherwise be logged in multiple en-
                               tries. The correct pattern allows it to be cap-
                               tured in a single entry.

                               For        more        information,         see
                               awslogs-datetime-format .

                               You  cannot  configure  both  the awslogs-date-
                               time-format and  awslogs-multiline-pattern  op-
                               tions.

                               NOTE:
                                   Multiline  logging performs regular expres-

                                   sages. This might have a negative impact on
                                   logging performance.

                                   awslogs-multiline-pattern

                               Required: No

                               This option defines a multiline  start  pattern
                               that  uses  a regular expression. A log message
                               consists of a line that matches the pattern and
                               any  following  lines  that dont match the pat-
                               tern. The matched line is the delimiter between
                               log messages.

                               This option is ignored if awslogs-datetime-for-
                               mat is also configured.

                               You  cannot  configure  both  the awslogs-date-
                               time-format and  awslogs-multiline-pattern  op-

                                   mode

                               Required: No

                               Valid values: non-blocking | blocking

                               This option defines the delivery  mode  of  log
                               messages from the container to CloudWatch Logs.
                               The delivery mode you choose  affects  applica-
                               tion  availability  when  the flow of logs from
                               container to CloudWatch is interrupted.

                               If you use the blocking mode and  the  flow  of
                               logs  to  CloudWatch is interrupted, calls from
                               container code  to  write  to  the  stdout  and
                               stderr  streams  will block. The logging thread
                               of the application will block as a result. This
                               may  cause  the application to become unrespon-
                               sive and lead to container healthcheck failure.

                               If you use  the  non-blocking  mode,  the  con-
                               tainer's  logs are instead stored in an in-mem-
                               ory intermediate  buffer  configured  with  the
                               max-buffer-size  option.  This prevents the ap-
                               plication from becoming unresponsive when  logs
                               cannot  be sent to CloudWatch. We recommend us-
                               ing this mode if you  want  to  ensure  service
                               availability  and  are okay with some log loss.

                               Required: No

                               Default value: 1m

                               When non-blocking mode is  used,  the  max-buf-
                               fer-size  log  option  controls the size of the
                               buffer that's  used  for  intermediate  message
                               storage.  Make sure to specify an adequate buf-
                               fer size based on your  application.  When  the
                               buffer fills up, further logs cannot be stored.
                               Logs that cannot be stored are lost.

                               To route logs using the splunk log router,  you
                               need to specify a splunk-token and a splunk-url
                               .

                               When you use  the  awsfirelens  log  router  to
                               route logs to an Amazon Web Services Service or
                               Amazon Web Services Partner Network destination
                               for  log storage and analytics, you can set the
                               log-driver-buffer-limit  option  to  limit  the
                               number  of  events that are buffered in memory,
                               before being sent to the log router  container.
                               It can help to resolve potential log loss issue
                               because high throughput might result in  memory
                               running out for the buffer inside of Docker.

                               Other   options  you  can  specify  when  using
                               awsfirelens to route logs depend on the  desti-
                               nation.  When  you  export  logs to Amazon Data
                               Firehose, you can specify the Amazon  Web  Ser-
                               vices Region with region and a name for the log
                               stream with delivery_stream .

                               When you export logs  to  Amazon  Kinesis  Data
                               Streams, you can specify an Amazon Web Services
                               Region with region and a data stream name  with
                               stream .

                               When  you export logs to Amazon OpenSearch Ser-

                               specify the bucket using the bucket option. You
                               can also specify region , total_file_size , up-
                               load_timeout , and use_put_object as options.

                               This parameter requires  version  1.19  of  the
                               Docker  Remote API or greater on your container
                               instance. To check the Docker Remote  API  ver-

                                      NOTE:
                                          If the SSM Parameter Store parameter
                                          exists in the  same  Region  as  the
                                          task  you're launching, then you can
                                          use either the full ARN or  name  of
                                          the  parameter. If the parameter ex-
                                          ists in a different Region, then the
                                          full ARN must be specified.

                     serviceConnectResources -> (list)
                        The list of Service Connect resources that are associ-
                        ated with this deployment. Each list entry maps a dis-
                        covery name to a Cloud Map service name.

                        (structure)
                            The  Service  Connect resource. Each configuration
                            maps a discovery name to a Cloud Map service name.
                            The  data  is  stored  in Cloud Map as part of the
                            Service Connect configuration for  each  discovery
                            name of this Amazon ECS service.

                            A  task  can  resolve  the dnsName for each of the
                            clientAliases of a service. However a  task  can't
                            resolve  the  discovery names. If you want to con-
                            nect to a service, refer to the ServiceConnectCon-
                            figuration  of that service for the list of clien-
                            tAliases that you can use.

                            discoveryName -> (string)
                               The discovery name of this Service Connect  re-
                               source.

                               The  discoveryName is the name of the new Cloud
                               Map service that Amazon ECS  creates  for  this
                               Amazon  ECS service. This must be unique within
                               the Cloud Map namespace. The name  can  contain
                               up  to 64 characters. The name can include low-
                               ercase letters, numbers, underscores  (_),  and
                               hyphens  (-).  The  name can't start with a hy-
                               phen.

                               If the discoveryName isn't specified, the  port
                               mapping  name  from the task definition is used
                               in portName.namespace .

                            discoveryArn -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  for  the  name-
                               space  in  Cloud Map that matches the discovery
                               name for this Service Connect resource. You can
                               use  this  ARN in other integrations with Cloud
                               Map. However, Service Connect can't ensure con-
                               nectivity outside of Amazon ECS.

                     volumeConfigurations -> (list)
                        The  details of the volume that was configuredAtLaunch
                        . You can configure different settings like the  size,
                        throughput,     volumeType,     and    ecryption    in
                        ServiceManagedEBSVolumeConfiguration . The name of the
                        volume must match the name from the task definition.

                        (structure)
                            The  configuration  for  a volume specified in the
                            task definition as a volume that is configured  at
                            launch  time. Currently, the only supported volume
                            type is an Amazon EBS volume.

                            name -> (string)
                               The name of the volume. This value  must  match
                               the  volume  name from the Volume object in the
                               task definition.

                            managedEBSVolume -> (structure)
                               The configuration for  the  Amazon  EBS  volume
                               that Amazon ECS creates and manages on your be-
                               half. These settings are used  to  create  each
                               Amazon  EBS volume, with one volume created for
                               each task in the service. The Amazon  EBS  vol-
                               umes  are visible in your account in the Amazon
                               EC2 console once they are created.

                               encrypted -> (boolean)
                                   Indicates whether the volume should be  en-
                                   crypted.  If no value is specified, encryp-
                                   tion is turned on by default. This  parame-
                                   ter  maps  1:1 with the Encrypted parameter
                                   of the CreateVolume API in the  Amazon  EC2
                                   API Reference .

                               kmsKeyId -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) identifier
                                   of the Amazon Web Services  Key  Management
                                   Service  key  to use for Amazon EBS encryp-
                                   tion. When encryption is turned on  and  no

                                   is used. This parameter maps 1:1  with  the
                                   KmsKeyId  parameter of the CreateVolume API
                                   in the Amazon EC2 API Reference .

                               sizeInGiB -> (integer)
                                   The size of the volume  in  GiB.  You  must
                                   specify  either a volume size or a snapshot

                                   the volume. You must specify either a snap-
                                   shot  ID  or  a volume size. This parameter
                                   maps 1:1 with the SnapshotId  parameter  of
                                   the  CreateVolume API in the Amazon EC2 API
                                   Reference .

                               iops -> (integer)
                                   The number of  I/O  operations  per  second
                                   (IOPS).  For  gp3  , io1 , and io2 volumes,
                                   this represents the number of IOPS that are
                                   provisioned  for  the  volume. For gp2 vol-
                                   umes, this represents the baseline  perfor-
                                   mance  of  the volume and the rate at which
                                   the  volume  accumulates  I/O  credits  for
                                   bursting.

                                   The  following are the supported values for
                                   each volume type.

                                   o gp3 : 3,000 - 16,000 IOPS

                                   o io1 : 100 - 64,000 IOPS

                                   o io2 : 100 - 256,000 IOPS

                                   This parameter is required for io1 and  io2
                                   volume  types.  The default for gp3 volumes
                                   is 3,000 IOPS . This parameter is not  sup-
                                   ported  for  st1 , sc1 , or standard volume
                                   types.

                                   This parameter maps 1:1 with the  Iops  pa-
                                   rameter of the CreateVolume API in the Ama-
                                   zon EC2 API Reference .

                               throughput -> (integer)
                                   The throughput to provision for  a  volume,
                                   in  MiB/s,  with  a maximum of 1,000 MiB/s.
                                   This parameter maps 1:1 with the Throughput
                                   parameter  of  the  CreateVolume API in the
                                   Amazon EC2 API Reference .

                                   WARNING:
                                      This parameter is only supported for the
                                      gp3 volume type.

                               tagSpecifications -> (list)
                                   The tags to apply to the volume. Amazon ECS
                                   applies service-managed  tags  by  default.
                                   This  parameter maps 1:1 with the TagSpeci-
                                   fications.N parameter of  the  CreateVolume
                                   API in the Amazon EC2 API Reference .

                                   (structure)

                                      resourceType -> (string)
                                          The type of volume resource.

                                      tags -> (list)
                                          The tags applied to this Amazon  EBS
                                          volume.  AmazonECSCreated  and  Ama-
                                          zonECSManaged are reserved tags that
                                          can't be used.

                                          (structure)
                                             The  metadata that you apply to a
                                             resource to help  you  categorize
                                             and  organize them. Each tag con-
                                             sists of a key  and  an  optional
                                             value. You define them.

                                             The  following basic restrictions
                                             apply to tags:

                                             o Maximum number of tags per  re-
                                               source - 50

                                             o For each resource, each tag key
                                               must be unique,  and  each  tag
                                               key can have only one value.

                                             o Maximum  key  length - 128 Uni-
                                               code characters in UTF-8

                                             o Maximum value length - 256 Uni-
                                               code characters in UTF-8

                                             o If  your tagging schema is used
                                               across  multiple  services  and
                                               resources,  remember that other
                                               services may have  restrictions
                                               on  allowed  characters. Gener-
                                               ally  allowed  characters  are:
                                               letters,  numbers,  and  spaces
                                               representable in UTF-8, and the
                                               following characters: + - = . _
                                               : / @.

                                             o Tag   keys   and   values   are
                                               case-sensitive.

                                             o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any
                                               upper or lowercase  combination
                                               of  such as a prefix for either
                                               keys or values  as  it  is  re-

                                               use. You cannot edit or  delete
                                               tag  keys  or  values with this
                                               prefix. Tags with  this  prefix
                                               do  not count against your tags
                                               per resource limit.

                                             key -> (string)
                                                 One part of a key-value  pair
                                                 that  make up a tag. A key is
                                                 a  general  label  that  acts
                                                 like a category for more spe-
                                                 cific tag values.

                                             value -> (string)
                                                 The  optional   part   of   a
                                                 key-value pair that make up a
                                                 tag. A value acts  as  a  de-
                                                 scriptor  within  a tag cate-
                                                 gory (key).

                                      propagateTags -> (string)
                                          Determines whether to propagate  the
                                          tags from the task definition to the
                                          Amazon EBS  volume.  Tags  can  only
                                          propagate  to a SERVICE specified in
                                          ServiceVolumeConfiguration .  If  no
                                          value  is specified, the tags aren't
                                          propagated.

                               roleArn -> (string)
                                   The ARN of the IAM role to  associate  with
                                   this  volume. This is the Amazon ECS infra-
                                   structure IAM role that is used  to  manage
                                   your Amazon Web Services infrastructure. We
                                   recommend using the Amazon ECS-managed Ama-
                                   zonECSInfrastructureRolePolicyForVolumes
                                   IAM policy with this role. For more  infor-

                               filesystemType -> (string)
                                   The filesystem type  for  the  volume.  For
                                   volumes  created  from a snapshot, you must
                                   specify the same filesystem type  that  the
                                   volume was using when the snapshot was cre-
                                   ated. If there is a  filesystem  type  mis-
                                   match, the task will fail to start.

                                   The  available  Linux  filesystem types are
                                   ext3 , ext4 , and xfs  .  If  no  value  is
                                   specified,  the xfs filesystem type is used
                                   by default.

                                   The available Windows filesystem types  are
                                   NTFS .

                        The Unix timestamp for the time  when  the  event  was
                        triggered.

                     message -> (string)
                        The event message.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix timestamp for the time when the service was created.

              placementConstraints -> (list)
                 The placement constraints for the tasks in the service.

                 (structure)
                     An  object  representing  a constraint on task placement.
                     For more information, see Task placement  constraints  in
                     the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                     NOTE:
                        If  you're  using the Fargate launch type, task place-
                        ment constraints aren't supported.

                     type -> (string)
                        The type of constraint. Use distinctInstance to ensure
                        that  each  task in a particular group is running on a
                        different container instance. Use memberOf to restrict
                        the selection to a group of valid candidates.

                     expression -> (string)
                        A  cluster  query  language expression to apply to the
                        constraint. The expression can have a  maximum  length
                        of 2000 characters. You can't specify an expression if
                        the constraint type is distinctInstance . For more in-
                        formation,  see  Cluster  query language in the Amazon
                        Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

              placementStrategy -> (list)
                 The placement strategy that determines how tasks for the ser-
                 vice are placed.

                 (structure)
                     The  task  placement  strategy for a task or service. For
                     more information, see Task placement  strategies  in  the
                     Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                     type -> (string)
                        The  type  of placement strategy. The random placement
                        strategy randomly places  tasks  on  available  candi-
                        dates. The spread placement strategy spreads placement
                        across available candidates evenly based on the  field
                        parameter. The binpack strategy places tasks on avail-
                        able candidates that have the least  available  amount
                        of the resource that's specified with the field param-
                        eter. For example, if you binpack on memory, a task is
                        placed  on  the  instance with the least amount of re-
                        maining memory but still enough to run the task.

                     field -> (string)
                        The field to apply the placement strategy against. For
                        the  spread  placement  strategy, valid values are in-
                        stanceId (or host , which has the same effect), or any
                        platform  or custom attribute that's applied to a con-
                        tainer  instance,  such  as   attribute:ecs.availabil-
                        ity-zone  .  For the binpack placement strategy, valid
                        values are cpu and memory . For the  random  placement
                        strategy, this field is not used.

              networkConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The  VPC  subnet  and  security group configuration for tasks
                 that receive their own elastic network interface by using the
                 awsvpc networking mode.

                 awsvpcConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The  VPC  subnets and security groups that are associated
                     with a task.

                     NOTE:
                        All specified subnets and security groups must be from
                        the same VPC.

                     subnets -> (list)
                        The  IDs  of  the  subnets associated with the task or
                        service. There's a limit of 16  subnets  that  can  be
                        specified per awsvpcConfiguration .

                        NOTE:
                            All specified subnets must be from the same VPC.

                        (string)

                     securityGroups -> (list)
                        The  IDs  of  the  security groups associated with the
                        task or service.  If  you  don't  specify  a  security
                        group, the default security group for the VPC is used.
                        There's a limit of 5 security groups that can be spec-
                        ified per awsvpcConfiguration .

                        NOTE:
                            All  specified  security  groups  must be from the
                            same VPC.

                        (string)

                     assignPublicIp -> (string)
                        Whether the task's elastic network interface  receives
                        a public IP address. The default value is DISABLED .

              healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds -> (integer)
                 The  period  of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS service
                 scheduler ignores unhealthy  Elastic  Load  Balancing  target
                 health checks after a task has first started.

              schedulingStrategy -> (string)
                 The  scheduling strategy to use for the service. For more in-
                 formation, see Services .

                 There are two service scheduler strategies available.

                 o REPLICA -The replica scheduling strategy places  and  main-
                   tains  the  desired number of tasks across your cluster. By
                   default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across  Avail-
                   ability  Zones.  You  can use task placement strategies and
                   constraints to customize task placement decisions.

                 o DAEMON -The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly  one
                   task on each active container instance. This task meets all
                   of the task placement constraints that you specify in  your
                   cluster.  The  service  scheduler  also  evaluates the task
                   placement constraints for running tasks. It stop tasks that
                   don't meet the placement constraints.

                 NOTE:
                     Fargate  tasks don't support the DAEMON scheduling strat-
                     egy.

              deploymentController -> (structure)
                 The deployment controller type the service is using.

                 type -> (string)
                     The deployment controller type to use.

                     There are three deployment controller types available:
                        ECS

                     The rolling update (ECS ) deployment  type  involves  re-
                     placing the current running version of the container with
                     the latest version. The number of containers  Amazon  ECS
                     adds  or removes from the service during a rolling update
                     is controlled by adjusting the minimum and maximum number
                     of  healthy tasks allowed during a service deployment, as
                     specified in the DeploymentConfiguration .

                     For  more  information  about  rolling  deployments,  see
                     Deploy Amazon ECS services by replacing tasks in the Ama-
                     zon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .
                        CODE_DEPLOY

                     The blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY ) deployment  type  uses  the
                     blue/green  deployment model powered by CodeDeploy, which
                     allows you to verify a new deployment of a service before
                     sending production traffic to it.

                     For  more  information  about blue/green deployments, see
                     Validate the state of an Amazon ECS  service  before  de-
                     ployment  in  the Amazon Elastic Container Service Devel-
                     oper Guide .
                        EXTERNAL

                     The external (EXTERNAL ) deployment type enables  you  to
                     use  any  third-party deployment controller for full con-
                     trol over the deployment process for an Amazon  ECS  ser-
                     vice.

                     For  more  information  about  external  deployments, see
                     Deploy Amazon ECS services using a third-party controller
                     in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

              tags -> (list)
                 The  metadata that you apply to the service to help you cate-
                 gorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key  and  an
                 optional value. You define bot the key and value.

                 The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                 o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                 o For  each  resource,  each tag key must be unique, and each
                   tag key can have only one value.

                 o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
                   resources,  remember  that other services may have restric-
                   tions on allowed characters. Generally  allowed  characters
                   are:  letters,  numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8,
                   and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.

                 o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                 o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combina-
                   tion of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is
                   reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You  cannot  edit  or
                   delete  tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this
                   prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.

                 (structure)
                     The metadata that you apply to a  resource  to  help  you
                     categorize  and organize them. Each tag consists of a key
                     and an optional value. You define them.

                     The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                     o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                     o For each resource, each tag key  must  be  unique,  and
                       each tag key can have only one value.

                     o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                     o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                     o If your tagging schema is used across multiple services
                       and resources, remember that other  services  may  have
                       restrictions  on  allowed characters. Generally allowed
                       characters are: letters,  numbers,  and  spaces  repre-
                       sentable  in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - =
                       . _ : / @.

                     o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                     o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase com-
                       bination  of such as a prefix for either keys or values
                       as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You can-
                       not edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix.
                       Tags with this prefix do not count  against  your  tags
                       per resource limit.

                     key -> (string)
                        One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key
                        is a general label that acts like a category for  more
                        specific tag values.

                     value -> (string)
                        The  optional  part of a key-value pair that make up a
                        tag. A value acts as a descriptor within a  tag  cate-
                        gory (key).

              createdBy -> (string)
                 The principal that created the service.

              enableECSManagedTags -> (boolean)
                 Determines  whether  to  use  Amazon ECS managed tags for the
                 tasks in the service. For more information, see Tagging  Your
                 Amazon  ECS Resources in the Amazon Elastic Container Service
                 Developer Guide .

              propagateTags -> (string)
                 Determines whether to propagate the tags from the task  defi-
                 nition  or the service to the task. If no value is specified,
                 the tags aren't propagated.

              enableExecuteCommand -> (boolean)
                 Determines  whether  the  execute  command  functionality  is
                 turned  on  for  the  service.  If true , the execute command
                 functionality is turned on for all  containers  in  tasks  as
                 part of the service.

              availabilityZoneRebalancing -> (string)
                 Indicates  whether  to  use Availability Zone rebalancing for
                 the service.

                 For more information, see Balancing  an  Amazon  ECS  service
                 across  Availability  Zones  in  the Amazon Elastic Container
                 Service Developer Guide .

       failures -> (list)
          Any failures associated with the call.

          (structure)
              A failed resource. For a list of common causes, see API  failure
              reasons  in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide
              .

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the failed resource.

              reason -> (string)
                 The reason for the failure.

              detail -> (string)
                 The details of the failure.
