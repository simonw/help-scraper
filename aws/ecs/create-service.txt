CREATE-SERVICE()                                              CREATE-SERVICE()



NAME
       create-service -

DESCRIPTION
       Runs  and  maintains your desired number of tasks from a specified task
       definition. If the number of tasks running in a service drops below the
       desiredCount  ,  Amazon ECS runs another copy of the task in the speci-
       fied cluster. To update an existing service, see the UpdateService  ac-
       tion.

       In  addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service,
       you can optionally run your service behind one or more load  balancers.
       The load balancers distribute traffic across the tasks that are associ-
       ated with the service. For more information, see Service Load Balancing
       in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

       Tasks  for  services  that  don't  use  a  load balancer are considered
       healthy if they're in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that use  a
       load  balancer  are  considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state
       and the container instance  that  they're  hosted  on  is  reported  as
       healthy by the load balancer.

       There are two service scheduler strategies available:

       o REPLICA  -  The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains your
         desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the  service
         scheduler  spreads  tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task
         placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement  de-
         cisions.  For more information, see Service Scheduler Concepts in the
         Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

       o DAEMON - The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one  task  on
         each  active  container instance that meets all of the task placement
         constraints that you specify in your cluster. The  service  scheduler
         also  evaluates  the task placement constraints for running tasks. It
         also stops tasks that don't meet the placement constraints. When  us-
         ing  this  strategy,  you  don't  need to specify a desired number of
         tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto  Scaling  poli-
         cies.  For  more  information,  see Service Scheduler Concepts in the
         Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

       You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service.
       The  deployment  is  initiated by changing properties. For example, the
       deployment might be initiated by the task definition or by your desired
       count  of a service. This is done with an  UpdateService operation. The
       default value for a replica service for minimumHealthyPercent is  100%.
       The default value for a daemon service for minimumHealthyPercent is 0%.

       If  a  service  uses the ECS deployment controller, the minimum healthy
       percent represents a lower limit on the number of tasks  in  a  service
       that  must  remain  in  the RUNNING state during a deployment. Specifi-
       cally, it represents it as a percentage of your desired number of tasks
       (rounded up to the nearest integer). This happens when any of your con-
       tainer instances are in the DRAINING  state  if  the  service  contains
       tasks  using  the EC2 launch type. Using this parameter, you can deploy
       without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if you set your
       service to have desired number of four tasks and a minimum healthy per-
       cent of 50%, the scheduler might stop two existing  tasks  to  free  up
       cluster  capacity before starting two new tasks. If they're in the RUN-
       NING state, tasks for services that don't use a load balancer are  con-
       sidered  healthy  .  If  they're  in  the RUNNING state and reported as
       healthy by the load balancer, tasks for services that  do  use  a  load
       balancer are considered healthy . The default value for minimum healthy
       percent is 100%.

       If a service uses the ECS deployment controller,  the  maximum  percent
       parameter represents an upper limit on the number of tasks in a service
       that are allowed in the RUNNING or PENDING state during  a  deployment.
       Specifically, it represents it as a percentage of the desired number of
       tasks (rounded down to the nearest integer). This happens when  any  of
       your  container instances are in the DRAINING state if the service con-
       tains tasks using the EC2 launch type. Using this  parameter,  you  can
       define  the  deployment  batch size. For example, if your service has a
       desired number of four tasks and a maximum percent value of  200%,  the
       scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks
       (provided that the cluster resources required to  do  this  are  avail-
       able). The default value for maximum percent is 200%.

       If  a  service  uses either the CODE_DEPLOY or EXTERNAL deployment con-
       troller types and tasks that use  the  EC2  launch  type,  the  minimum
       healthy  percent and maximum percent values are used only to define the
       lower and upper limit on the number of the tasks in  the  service  that
       remain  in the RUNNING state. This is while the container instances are
       in the DRAINING state. If the tasks in  the  service  use  the  Fargate
       launch  type,  the  minimum  healthy percent and maximum percent values
       aren't used. This is the case even if they're  currently  visible  when
       describing your service.

       When  creating  a service that uses the EXTERNAL deployment controller,
       you can specify only parameters that aren't controlled at the task  set
       level.  The  only  required  parameter is the service name. You control
       your services using the  CreateTaskSet operation. For more information,
       see Amazon ECS Deployment Types in the Amazon Elastic Container Service
       Developer Guide .

       When the service scheduler  launches  new  tasks,  it  determines  task
       placement in your cluster using the following logic:

       o Determine  which  of the container instances in your cluster can sup-
         port the task definition of your service. For example, they have  the
         required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes.

       o By  default,  the  service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across
         Availability Zones in this manner. This is the case even if  you  can
         choose  a different placement strategy with the placementStrategy pa-
         rameter.

         o Sort the valid container instances, giving  priority  to  instances
           that  have  the  fewest number of running tasks for this service in
           their respective Availability Zone. For example, if zone A has  one
           running  service  task and zones B and C each have zero, valid con-
           tainer instances in either zone B or C are considered  optimal  for
           placement.

         o Place  the new service task on a valid container instance in an op-
           timal Availability Zone based on the previous steps, favoring  con-
           tainer  instances  with the fewest number of running tasks for this
           service.

OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The short name or full Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the  cluster
          that  you  run your service on. If you do not specify a cluster, the
          default cluster is assumed.

       --service-name (string)
          The name of your service. Up to 255 letters  (uppercase  and  lower-
          case),  numbers, underscores, and hyphens are allowed. Service names
          must be unique within a cluster, but you can  have  similarly  named
          services in multiple clusters within a Region or across multiple Re-
          gions.

       --task-definition (string)
          The family and revision (family:revision ) or full ARN of  the  task
          definition  to  run  in your service. If a revision isn't specified,
          the latest ACTIVE revision is used.

          A task definition must be specified if the service uses  either  the
          ECS or CODE_DEPLOY deployment controllers.

       --load-balancers (list)
          A  load  balancer object representing the load balancers to use with
          your service. For more information, see Service  Load  Balancing  in
          the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

          If  the service uses the rolling update (ECS ) deployment controller
          and using either an Application Load Balancer or Network  Load  Bal-
          ancer,  you  must specify one or more target group ARNs to attach to
          the service. The service-linked role is required for  services  that
          use  multiple  target  groups.  For more information, see Using ser-
          vice-linked roles for Amazon ECS in  the  Amazon  Elastic  Container
          Service Developer Guide .

          If  the service uses the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller, the ser-
          vice is required to use either an Application Load Balancer or  Net-
          work  Load  Balancer.  When creating an CodeDeploy deployment group,
          you specify two target groups (referred to as a  targetGroupPair  ).
          During  a  deployment,  CodeDeploy determines which task set in your
          service has the status PRIMARY , and it associates one target  group
          with  it.  Then,  it also associates the other target group with the
          replacement task set. The load balancer can also have up to two lis-
          teners:  a  required listener for production traffic and an optional
          listener that you can use to perform validation  tests  with  Lambda
          functions before routing production traffic to it.

          After  you create a service using the ECS deployment controller, the
          load balancer name or target group ARN,  container  name,  and  con-
          tainer  port  that's  specified  in  the  service definition are im-
          mutable. If you use the  CODE_DEPLOY  deployment  controller,  these
          values can be changed when updating the service.

          For  Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers, this ob-
          ject must contain the load balancer target group ARN, the  container
          name,  and  the container port to access from the load balancer. The
          container name must be as it appears in a container definition.  The
          load  balancer name parameter must be omitted. When a task from this
          service is placed on a container instance,  the  container  instance
          and  port  combination is registered as a target in the target group
          that's specified here.

          For Classic Load Balancers, this object must contain the  load  bal-
          ancer  name,  the  container name , and the container port to access
          from the load balancer. The container name must be as it appears  in
          a container definition. The target group ARN parameter must be omit-
          ted. When a task from this service is  placed  on  a  container  in-
          stance,  the container instance is registered with the load balancer
          that's specified here.

          Services with tasks that use the awsvpc network mode  (for  example,
          those  with  the  Fargate launch type) only support Application Load
          Balancers and Network Load Balancers. Classic Load Balancers  aren't
          supported.  Also,  when  you create any target groups for these ser-
          vices, you must choose ip as the target type, not instance . This is
          because  tasks  that use the awsvpc network mode are associated with
          an elastic network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance.

          (structure)
              The load balancer configuration to use with a  service  or  task
              set.

              For  specific  notes  and restrictions regarding the use of load
              balancers with services and task sets, see the CreateService and
              CreateTaskSet actions.

              targetGroupArn -> (string)
                 The  full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Elastic Load Bal-
                 ancing target group or groups associated with  a  service  or
                 task set.

                 A  target  group ARN is only specified when using an Applica-
                 tion Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. If you're  using
                 a Classic Load Balancer, omit the target group ARN.

                 For  services  using  the  ECS deployment controller, you can
                 specify one or multiple target groups. For more  information,
                 see  Registering Multiple Target Groups with a Service in the
                 Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                 For services using  the  CODE_DEPLOY  deployment  controller,
                 you're required to define two target groups for the load bal-
                 ancer. For more information, see Blue/Green  Deployment  with
                 CodeDeploy  in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer
                 Guide .

                 WARNING:
                     If your service's task definition uses the awsvpc network
                     mode, you must choose ip as the target type, not instance
                     . Do this when creating your target groups because  tasks
                     that  use  the awsvpc network mode are associated with an
                     elastic network interface, not an  Amazon  EC2  instance.
                     This  network  mode  is  required  for the Fargate launch
                     type.

              loadBalancerName -> (string)
                 The name of the load balancer to associate  with  the  Amazon
                 ECS service or task set.

                 A  load  balancer name is only specified when using a Classic
                 Load Balancer. If you are using an Application Load  Balancer
                 or  a  Network Load Balancer the load balancer name parameter
                 should be omitted.

              containerName -> (string)
                 The name of the container (as it appears in a container defi-
                 nition) to associate with the load balancer.

              containerPort -> (integer)
                 The  port  on  the  container to associate with the load bal-
                 ancer. This port must correspond to a  containerPort  in  the
                 task definition the tasks in the service are using. For tasks
                 that use the EC2 launch type, the container instance  they're
                 launched on must allow ingress traffic on the hostPort of the
                 port mapping.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          targetGroupArn=string,loadBalancerName=string,containerName=string,containerPort=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [

              "containerPort": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --service-registries (list)
          The details of the service discovery registry to associate with this
          service. For more information, see Service discovery .

          NOTE:
              Each service may be associated with one service registry. Multi-
              ple service registries for each service isn't supported.

          (structure)
              The details for the service registry.

              registryArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service  registry.  The
                 currently  supported  service registry is Cloud Map. For more
                 information, see CreateService .

              port -> (integer)
                 The port value used if your service discovery service  speci-
                 fied  an  SRV  record.  This  field might be used if both the
                 awsvpc network mode and SRV records are used.

              containerName -> (string)
                 The container name value to be used for your service  discov-
                 ery  service.  It's already specified in the task definition.
                 If the task definition that your service task specifies  uses
                 the  bridge or host network mode, you must specify a contain-
                 erName and containerPort combination from  the  task  defini-
                 tion. If the task definition that your service task specifies
                 uses the awsvpc network mode and a type  SRV  DNS  record  is
                 used,  you must specify either a containerName and container-
                 Port combination or a port value. However, you can't  specify
                 both.

              containerPort -> (integer)
                 The port value to be used for your service discovery service.
                 It's already specified in the task definition.  If  the  task
                 definition  your  service  task  specifies uses the bridge or
                 host network mode, you must specify a containerName and  con-
                 tainerPort  combination from the task definition. If the task
                 definition your service task specifies uses the  awsvpc  net-
                 work mode and a type SRV DNS record is used, you must specify
                 either a containerName and  containerPort  combination  or  a
                 port value. However, you can't specify both.

       --desired-count (integer)
          The  number  of  instantiations  of the specified task definition to
          place and keep running on your cluster.

          This is required if schedulingStrategy is REPLICA  or  isn't  speci-
          fied. If schedulingStrategy is DAEMON then this isn't required.

       --client-token (string)
          An  identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the re-
          quest. It must be unique and is case sensitive. Up to 32 ASCII char-
          acters are allowed.

       --launch-type (string)
          The  infrastructure  that you run your service on. For more informa-
          tion, see Amazon ECS launch types in the  Amazon  Elastic  Container
          Service Developer Guide .

          The  FARGATE launch type runs your tasks on Fargate On-Demand infra-
          structure.

          NOTE:
              Fargate Spot infrastructure is available for use but a  capacity
              provider  strategy  must  be  used.  For  more  information, see
              Fargate capacity providers in the Amazon ECS User Guide for Far-
              gate .

          The  EC2  launch type runs your tasks on Amazon EC2 instances regis-
          tered to your cluster.

          The EXTERNAL launch type runs your tasks on your on-premises  server
          or virtual machine (VM) capacity registered to your cluster.

          A service can use either a launch type or a capacity provider strat-
          egy. If a launchType is specified, the capacityProviderStrategy  pa-
          rameter must be omitted.

          Possible values:

          o EC2

          o FARGATE

          o EXTERNAL

       --capacity-provider-strategy (list)
          The capacity provider strategy to use for the service.

          If a capacityProviderStrategy is specified, the launchType parameter
          must be omitted. If no  capacityProviderStrategy  or  launchType  is
          specified,  the  defaultCapacityProviderStrategy  for the cluster is
          used.

          A capacity provider strategy may contain a  maximum  of  6  capacity
          providers.

          (structure)
              The details of a capacity provider strategy. A capacity provider
              strategy can be set when using the   RunTask  or   CreateCluster
              APIs  or as the default capacity provider strategy for a cluster
              with the  CreateCluster API.

              Only capacity providers that are already associated with a clus-
              ter  and  have an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used in a ca-
              pacity provider strategy. The   PutClusterCapacityProviders  API
              is used to associate a capacity provider with a cluster.

              If  specifying  a  capacity  provider  that uses an Auto Scaling
              group, the capacity provider must already be created.  New  Auto
              Scaling  group  capacity providers can be created with the  Cre-
              ateCapacityProvider API operation.

              To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either  the  FARGATE
              or   FARGATE_SPOT   capacity  providers.  The  Fargate  capacity
              providers are available to all accounts and only need to be  as-
              sociated with a cluster to be used in a capacity provider strat-
              egy.

              A capacity provider strategy may contain a maximum of 6 capacity
              providers.

              capacityProvider -> (string)
                 The short name of the capacity provider.

              weight -> (integer)
                 The  weight  value  designates the relative percentage of the
                 total number of tasks launched that should use the  specified
                 capacity  provider. The weight value is taken into considera-
                 tion after the base value, if defined, is satisfied.

                 If no weight value is specified, the default value  of  0  is
                 used. When multiple capacity providers are specified within a
                 capacity provider strategy, at  least  one  of  the  capacity
                 providers  must have a weight value greater than zero and any
                 capacity providers with a weight of 0 can't be used to  place
                 tasks. If you specify multiple capacity providers in a strat-
                 egy that all have a weight of 0 , any RunTask  or  CreateSer-
                 vice actions using the capacity provider strategy will fail.

                 An  example scenario for using weights is defining a strategy
                 that contains two capacity providers and both have  a  weight
                 of  1  ,  then  when the base is satisfied, the tasks will be
                 split evenly across the two capacity  providers.  Using  that
                 same  logic,  if  you  specify  a  weight  of  1  for capaci-
                 tyProviderA and a weight of 4 for  capacityProviderB  ,  then
                 for  every one task that's run using capacityProviderA , four
                 tasks would use capacityProviderB .

              base -> (integer)
                 The base value designates how many tasks, at  a  minimum,  to
                 run  on  the  specified  capacity provider. Only one capacity
                 provider in a capacity provider strategy can have a base  de-
                 fined.  If  no  value is specified, the default value of 0 is
                 used.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          capacityProvider=string,weight=integer,base=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "capacityProvider": "string",
              "weight": integer,
              "base": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --platform-version (string)
          The platform version that your tasks in the service are running  on.
          A  platform  version  is  specified only for tasks using the Fargate
          launch type. If one isn't specified, the LATEST platform version  is
          used.  For  more  information,  see Fargate platform versions in the
          Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

       --role (string)
          The name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that al-
          lows  Amazon ECS to make calls to your load balancer on your behalf.
          This parameter is only permitted if you are using  a  load  balancer
          with  your  service  and your task definition doesn't use the awsvpc
          network mode. If you specify the role parameter, you must also spec-
          ify a load balancer object with the loadBalancers parameter.

          WARNING:
              If  your  account  has  already  created  the  Amazon  ECS  ser-
              vice-linked role, that role is used for your service unless  you
              specify a role here. The service-linked role is required if your
              task definition uses the awsvpc network mode or if  the  service
              is  configured  to use service discovery, an external deployment
              controller, multiple target groups, or Elastic Inference  accel-
              erators  in  which  case you don't specify a role here. For more
              information, see Using service-linked roles for  Amazon  ECS  in
              the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

          If  your  specified role has a path other than / , then you must ei-
          ther specify the full role ARN (this is recommended) or  prefix  the
          role  name  with  the path. For example, if a role with the name bar
          has a path of /foo/ then you would  specify  /foo/bar  as  the  role
          name.  For more information, see Friendly names and paths in the IAM
          User Guide .

       --deployment-configuration (structure)
          Optional deployment parameters that control how many tasks run  dur-
          ing the deployment and the ordering of stopping and starting tasks.

          deploymentCircuitBreaker -> (structure)

              NOTE:
                 The  deployment circuit breaker can only be used for services
                 using the rolling update (ECS ) deployment type.

              The deployment circuit breaker determines whether a service  de-
              ployment will fail if the service can't reach a steady state. If
              deployment circuit breaker is enabled, a service deployment will
              transition  to  a  failed state and stop launching new tasks. If
              rollback is enabled, when a service deployment fails,  the  ser-
              vice  is  rolled back to the last deployment that completed suc-
              cessfully.

              enable -> (boolean)
                 Determines whether to enable the deployment  circuit  breaker
                 logic for the service.

              rollback -> (boolean)
                 Determines whether to enable Amazon ECS to roll back the ser-
                 vice if a service deployment fails. If rollback  is  enabled,
                 when  a  service deployment fails, the service is rolled back
                 to the last deployment that completed successfully.

          maximumPercent -> (integer)
              If a service is using the rolling update (ECS ) deployment type,
              the  maximum  percent parameter represents an upper limit on the
              number of tasks in a service that are allowed in the RUNNING  or
              PENDING  state  during  a deployment, as a percentage of the de-
              sired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest integer), and
              while  any  container instances are in the DRAINING state if the
              service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter
              enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if
              your service has a desired number of four tasks  and  a  maximum
              percent  value  of  200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks
              before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the  cluster
              resources  required to do this are available). The default value
              for maximum percent is 200%.

              If a service is using the blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY ) or  EXTERNAL
              deployment  types  and  tasks  that use the EC2 launch type, the
              maximum percent value is set to the default value and is used to
              define the upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service
              that remain in the RUNNING state while the  container  instances
              are  in  the DRAINING state. If the tasks in the service use the
              Fargate launch type, the maximum percent value is not used,  al-
              though it is returned when describing your service.

          minimumHealthyPercent -> (integer)
              If a service is using the rolling update (ECS ) deployment type,
              the minimum healthy percent represents a lower limit on the num-
              ber  of tasks in a service that must remain in the RUNNING state
              during a deployment, as a percentage of the  desired  number  of
              tasks  (rounded  up  to the nearest integer), and while any con-
              tainer instances are in the DRAINING state if the  service  con-
              tains  tasks  using  the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables
              you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For ex-
              ample,  if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a
              minimum healthy percent of 50%, the scheduler may stop  two  ex-
              isting tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new
              tasks. Tasks for services that do not use a  load  balancer  are
              considered  healthy  if  they're in the RUNNING state; tasks for
              services that do use a load balancer are considered  healthy  if
              they're  in the RUNNING state and they're reported as healthy by
              the load balancer. The default value for minimum healthy percent
              is 100%.

              If  a service is using the blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY ) or EXTERNAL
              deployment types and tasks that use the  EC2  launch  type,  the
              minimum healthy percent value is set to the default value and is
              used to define the lower limit on the number of the tasks in the
              service that remain in the RUNNING state while the container in-
              stances are in the DRAINING state. If the tasks in  the  service
              use  the  Fargate launch type, the minimum healthy percent value
              is not used, although it is returned when describing  your  ser-
              vice.

          }

       --placement-constraints (list)
          An  array  of  placement constraint objects to use for tasks in your
          service. You can specify a maximum of 10 constraints for each  task.
          This  limit  includes  constraints  in the task definition and those
          specified at runtime.

          (structure)
              An object representing a constraint on task placement. For  more
              information,  see Task Placement Constraints in the Amazon Elas-
              tic Container Service Developer Guide .

              NOTE:
                 If you're using the Fargate launch type, task placement  con-
                 straints aren't supported.

              type -> (string)
                 The  type  of constraint. Use distinctInstance to ensure that
                 each task in a particular group is  running  on  a  different
                 container instance. Use memberOf to restrict the selection to
                 a group of valid candidates.

              expression -> (string)
                 A cluster query language expression  to  apply  to  the  con-
                 straint.  The  expression  can  have a maximum length of 2000
                 characters. You can't specify an expression if the constraint
                 type  is distinctInstance . For more information, see Cluster
                 query language in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Devel-
                 oper Guide .

            ...
          ]

       --placement-strategy (list)
          The placement strategy objects to use for tasks in your service. You
          can specify a maximum of 5 strategy rules for each service.

          (structure)
              The task placement strategy for a task or service. For more  in-
              formation,  see  Task Placement Strategies in the Amazon Elastic
              Container Service Developer Guide .

              type -> (string)
                 The type of placement strategy. The random placement strategy
                 randomly  places  tasks  on  available candidates. The spread
                 placement strategy spreads placement across available  candi-
                 dates evenly based on the field parameter. The binpack strat-
                 egy places tasks on available candidates that have the  least
                 available  amount  of  the resource that's specified with the
                 field parameter. For example, if you  binpack  on  memory,  a
                 task  is  placed on the instance with the least amount of re-
                 maining memory but still enough to run the task.

              field -> (string)
                 The field to apply the placement strategy  against.  For  the
                 spread  placement  strategy,  valid values are instanceId (or
                 host , which has the same effect), or any platform or  custom
                 attribute that's applied to a container instance, such as at-
                 tribute:ecs.availability-zone .  For  the  binpack  placement
                 strategy,  valid  values  are cpu and memory . For the random
                 placement strategy, this field is not used.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          type=string,field=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {

            }
            ...
          ]

       --network-configuration (structure)
          The network configuration for the service.  This  parameter  is  re-
          quired  for task definitions that use the awsvpc network mode to re-
          ceive their own elastic network interface, and  it  isn't  supported
          for  other  network modes. For more information, see Task networking
          in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

          awsvpcConfiguration -> (structure)
              The VPC subnets and security groups that are associated  with  a
              task.

              NOTE:
                 All  specified  subnets  and security groups must be from the
                 same VPC.

              subnets -> (list)
                 The IDs of the subnets associated with the task  or  service.
                 There's  a  limit  of  16  subnets  that can be specified per
                 AwsVpcConfiguration .

                 NOTE:
                     All specified subnets must be from the same VPC.

                 (string)

              securityGroups -> (list)
                 The IDs of the security groups associated with  the  task  or
                 service.  If  you don't specify a security group, the default
                 security group for the VPC is used. There's a limit of 5  se-
                 curity groups that can be specified per AwsVpcConfiguration .

                 NOTE:
                     All specified security groups must be from the same VPC.

                 (string)

              assignPublicIp -> (string)
                 Whether  the task's elastic network interface receives a pub-
                 lic IP address. The default value is DISABLED .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[string,string],securityGroups=[string,string],assignPublicIp=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "awsvpcConfiguration": {
              "subnets": ["string", ...],
              "securityGroups": ["string", ...],
              "assignPublicIp": "ENABLED"|"DISABLED"
            }
          }

       --health-check-grace-period-seconds (integer)
          The period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS  service  sched-
          uler  ignores  unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing target health checks
          after a task has first started. This is only used when your  service
          is  configured  to  use  a load balancer. If your service has a load
          balancer defined and you don't specify a health check  grace  period
          value, the default value of 0 is used.

          If your service's tasks take a while to start and respond to Elastic
          Load Balancing health checks, you can specify a health  check  grace
          period  of up to 2,147,483,647 seconds (about 69 years). During that
          time, the Amazon ECS service scheduler ignores health check  status.
          This  grace  period  can  prevent the service scheduler from marking
          tasks as unhealthy and stopping them before they have time  to  come
          up.

       --scheduling-strategy (string)
          The  scheduling  strategy  to use for the service. For more informa-
          tion, see Services .

          There are two service scheduler strategies available:

          o REPLICA -The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains  the
            desired  number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the ser-
            vice scheduler spreads tasks across Availability  Zones.  You  can
            use  task  placement  strategies and constraints to customize task
            placement decisions. This scheduler strategy is  required  if  the
            service  uses  the  CODE_DEPLOY  or EXTERNAL deployment controller
            types.

          o DAEMON -The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on
            each  active  container instance that meets all of the task place-
            ment constraints that you specify in  your  cluster.  The  service
            scheduler  also  evaluates the task placement constraints for run-
            ning tasks and will stop tasks that don't meet the placement  con-
            straints. When you're using this strategy, you don't need to spec-
            ify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy,  or  use
            Service Auto Scaling policies.

          NOTE:
              Tasks using the Fargate launch type or the CODE_DEPLOY or EXTER-
              NAL deployment controller types don't support the DAEMON  sched-
              uling strategy.

          Possible values:

          o REPLICA

          o DAEMON

       --deployment-controller (structure)
          The  deployment  controller to use for the service. If no deployment
          controller is specified, the default value of ECS is used.

          type -> (string)
              The deployment controller type to use.

              There are three deployment controller types available:
                 ECS

              The rolling update (ECS ) deployment type involves replacing the
              current  running  version  of the container with the latest ver-
              sion. The number of containers Amazon ECS adds or  removes  from
              the  service  during a rolling update is controlled by adjusting
              the minimum and maximum number of healthy tasks allowed during a
              service deployment, as specified in the  DeploymentConfiguration
              .
                 CODE_DEPLOY

              The  blue/green  (CODE_DEPLOY  )  deployment   type   uses   the
              blue/green  deployment model powered by CodeDeploy, which allows
              you to verify a new deployment of a service before sending  pro-
              duction traffic to it.
                 EXTERNAL

              The  external (EXTERNAL ) deployment type enables you to use any
              third-party deployment controller for full control over the  de-
              ployment process for an Amazon ECS service.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          type=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "type": "ECS"|"CODE_DEPLOY"|"EXTERNAL"
          }

       --tags (list)
          The  metadata  that  you apply to the service to help you categorize
          and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value,
          both  of  which  you define. When a service is deleted, the tags are
          deleted as well.

          The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

          o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

          o For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each  tag  key
            can have only one value.

          o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

          o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

          o If  your  tagging  schema is used across multiple services and re-
            sources, remember that other services may have restrictions on al-
            lowed  characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, num-
            bers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following charac-
            ters: + - = . _ : / @.

          o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

          o Do  not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination of
            such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is  reserved  for
            Amazon  Web  Services  use.  You cannot edit or delete tag keys or
            values with this prefix.  Tags  with  this  prefix  do  not  count
            against your tags per resource limit.

          (structure)
              The metadata that you apply to a resource to help you categorize
              and organize them. Each tag consists of a key  and  an  optional
              value. You define them.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

              o For  each  resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o If your tagging schema is used across  multiple  services  and
                resources,  remember that other services may have restrictions
                on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are:  let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
                lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.

              o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

              o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination
                of  such  as  a  prefix for either keys or values as it is re-
                served for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or  delete
                tag  keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do
                not count against your tags per resource limit.

              key -> (string)
                 One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key  is  a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              value -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a  tag.  A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --enable-ecs-managed-tags | --no-enable-ecs-managed-tags (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  to  enable Amazon ECS managed tags for the tasks
          within the service. For more information, see  Tagging  Your  Amazon
          ECS  Resources  in  the  Amazon  Elastic Container Service Developer
          Guide .

       --propagate-tags (string)
          Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the task definition  or
          the  service  to the tasks in the service. If no value is specified,
          the tags aren't propagated. Tags can only be propagated to the tasks
          within  the  service  during service creation. To add tags to a task
          after service creation or task creation, use  the   TagResource  API
          action.

          Possible values:

          o TASK_DEFINITION

          o SERVICE

       --enable-execute-command | --disable-execute-command (boolean)
          Determines  whether the execute command functionality is enabled for
          the service. If true , this enables execute command functionality on
          all containers in the service tasks.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       Example 4: To create a new service behind a load balancer

       The following create-service example shows how to create a service that
       is behind a load balancer. You must have a load balancer configured  in
       the  same  Region  as  your  container  instance. This example uses the
       --cli-input-json option and a JSON input  file  called  ecs-simple-ser-

OUTPUT
       service -> (structure)
          The full description of your service following the create call.

          A  service  will  return  either   a   capacityProviderStrategy   or
          launchType  parameter,  but not both, depending where one was speci-
          fied when it was created.

          If a service is using the ECS deployment controller, the deployment-
          Controller and taskSets parameters will not be returned.

          if  the  service uses the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller, the de-
          ploymentController , taskSets and deployments parameters will be re-
          turned, however the deployments parameter will be an empty list.

          serviceArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  that  identifies  the  service.  The  ARN contains the
              arn:aws:ecs namespace, followed by the Region  of  the  service,
              the  Amazon  Web  Services  account ID of the service owner, the
              service namespace, and  then  the  service  name.  For  example,
              arn:aws:ecs:region:012345678910:service/my-service .

          serviceName -> (string)
              The  name of your service. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and low-
              ercase), numbers, underscores, and hyphens are allowed.  Service
              names  must  be  unique  within a cluster. However, you can have
              similarly named services in multiple clusters within a Region or
              across multiple Regions.

          clusterArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the cluster that hosts the
              service.

          loadBalancers -> (list)
              A list of Elastic Load Balancing load balancer objects. It  con-
              tains  the  load balancer name, the container name, and the con-
              tainer port to access from the load balancer. The container name
              is as it appears in a container definition.

              (structure)
                 The load balancer configuration to use with a service or task
                 set.

                 For specific notes and restrictions regarding the use of load
                 balancers  with services and task sets, see the CreateService
                 and CreateTaskSet actions.

                 targetGroupArn -> (string)
                     The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  Elastic  Load
                     Balancing  target  group or groups associated with a ser-
                     vice or task set.

                     A target group ARN is only specified when using an Appli-
                     cation  Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. If you're
                     using a Classic Load Balancer, omit the target group ARN.

                     For services using the ECS deployment controller, you can
                     specify  one or multiple target groups. For more informa-
                     tion, see Registering Multiple Target Groups with a  Ser-
                     vice  in  the  Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer
                     Guide .

                     For services using the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller,
                     you're  required to define two target groups for the load
                     balancer. For more information, see Blue/Green Deployment
                     with  CodeDeploy  in the Amazon Elastic Container Service
                     Developer Guide .

                     WARNING:
                        If your service's task definition uses the awsvpc net-
                        work  mode, you must choose ip as the target type, not
                        instance . Do this when creating  your  target  groups
                        because tasks that use the awsvpc network mode are as-
                        sociated with an elastic  network  interface,  not  an
                        Amazon EC2 instance. This network mode is required for
                        the Fargate launch type.

                 loadBalancerName -> (string)
                     The name of the load balancer to associate with the  Ama-
                     zon ECS service or task set.

                     A load balancer name is only specified when using a Clas-
                     sic Load Balancer. If you are using an  Application  Load
                     Balancer  or  a  Network  Load Balancer the load balancer
                     name parameter should be omitted.

                 containerName -> (string)
                     The name of the container (as it appears in  a  container
                     definition) to associate with the load balancer.

                 containerPort -> (integer)
                     The port on the container to associate with the load bal-
                     ancer. This port must correspond to  a  containerPort  in
                     the  task  definition the tasks in the service are using.
                     For tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the container in-
                     stance  they're launched on must allow ingress traffic on
                     the hostPort of the port mapping.

          serviceRegistries -> (list)
              The details for the service discovery registries  to  assign  to
              this service. For more information, see Service Discovery .

              (structure)
                 The details for the service registry.

                 registryArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the service registry.
                     The currently supported service registry  is  Cloud  Map.
                     For more information, see CreateService .

                 port -> (integer)
                     The  port  value  used  if your service discovery service
                     specified an SRV record. This field might be used if both
                     the awsvpc network mode and SRV records are used.

                 containerName -> (string)
                     The container name value to be used for your service dis-
                     covery service. It's already specified in the task  defi-
                     nition.  If  the  task  definition that your service task
                     specifies uses the bridge or host network mode, you  must
                     specify  a  containerName  and  containerPort combination
                     from the task definition. If  the  task  definition  that
                     your  service task specifies uses the awsvpc network mode
                     and a type SRV DNS record is used, you must  specify  ei-
                     ther  a  containerName and containerPort combination or a
                     port value. However, you can't specify both.

                 containerPort -> (integer)
                     The port value to be used for your service discovery ser-
                     vice.  It's  already specified in the task definition. If
                     the task definition your service task specifies uses  the
                     bridge  or host network mode, you must specify a contain-
                     erName and containerPort combination from the task  defi-
                     nition.  If  the task definition your service task speci-
                     fies uses the awsvpc network mode  and  a  type  SRV  DNS
                     record  is  used, you must specify either a containerName
                     and containerPort combination or a port  value.  However,
                     you can't specify both.

          status -> (string)
              The  status of the service. The valid values are ACTIVE , DRAIN-
              ING , or INACTIVE .

          desiredCount -> (integer)
              The desired number of instantiations of the task  definition  to
              keep  running  on  the service. This value is specified when the
              service is created with  CreateService , and it can be  modified
              with  UpdateService .

          runningCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of  tasks  in  the  cluster that are in the RUNNING
              state.

          pendingCount -> (integer)
              The number of tasks in the  cluster  that  are  in  the  PENDING
              state.

          launchType -> (string)
              The  launch  type  the  service  is  using.  When  using the De-
              scribeServices API, this field is omitted  if  the  service  was
              created using a capacity provider strategy.

          capacityProviderStrategy -> (list)
              The  capacity provider strategy the service uses. When using the
              DescribeServices API, this field is omitted if the  service  was
              created using a launch type.

              (structure)
                 The  details  of  a  capacity  provider  strategy. A capacity
                 provider strategy can be set when using the  RunTask or  Cre-
                 ateCluster  APIs or as the default capacity provider strategy
                 for a cluster with the  CreateCluster API.

                 Only capacity providers that are already  associated  with  a
                 cluster  and have an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used in
                 a  capacity   provider   strategy.   The    PutClusterCapaci-
                 tyProviders API is used to associate a capacity provider with
                 a cluster.

                 If specifying a capacity provider that uses an  Auto  Scaling
                 group,  the  capacity  provider  must already be created. New
                 Auto Scaling group capacity providers can be created with the
                 CreateCapacityProvider API operation.

                 To  use  a Fargate capacity provider, specify either the FAR-
                 GATE or FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers. The Fargate capacity
                 providers  are  available to all accounts and only need to be
                 associated with a cluster to be used in a  capacity  provider
                 strategy.

                 A  capacity  provider strategy may contain a maximum of 6 ca-
                 pacity providers.

                 capacityProvider -> (string)
                     The short name of the capacity provider.

                 weight -> (integer)
                     The weight value designates the  relative  percentage  of
                     the  total  number  of tasks launched that should use the
                     specified capacity provider. The weight  value  is  taken
                     into  consideration  after the base value, if defined, is
                     satisfied.

                     If no weight value is specified, the default value  of  0
                     is  used.  When multiple capacity providers are specified
                     within a capacity provider strategy, at least one of  the
                     capacity  providers must have a weight value greater than
                     zero and any capacity providers with a weight of 0  can't
                     be  used to place tasks. If you specify multiple capacity
                     providers in a strategy that all have a weight of 0 , any
                     RunTask  or  CreateService  actions  using  the  capacity
                     provider strategy will fail.

                     An example scenario  for  using  weights  is  defining  a
                     strategy  that  contains  two capacity providers and both
                     have a weight of 1 , then when the base is satisfied, the
                     tasks  will  be  split  evenly  across  the  two capacity
                     providers. Using that same logic, if you specify a weight
                     of  1 for capacityProviderA and a weight of 4 for capaci-
                     tyProviderB , then for every one task  that's  run  using
                     capacityProviderA   ,   four   tasks  would  use  capaci-
                     tyProviderB .

                 base -> (integer)
                     The base value designates how many tasks, at  a  minimum,
                     to  run  on the specified capacity provider. Only one ca-
                     pacity provider in a capacity provider strategy can  have
                     a  base  defined.  If  no value is specified, the default
                     value of 0 is used.

          platformVersion -> (string)
              The platform version to run your service on. A platform  version
              is  only  specified for tasks that are hosted on Fargate. If one
              isn't specified, the LATEST platform version is used.  For  more
              information, see Fargate Platform Versions in the Amazon Elastic
              Container Service Developer Guide .

          platformFamily -> (string)
              The operating system that your tasks in the service  run  on.  A
              platform  family  is  specified only for tasks using the Fargate
              launch type.

              All tasks that run as part of this service  must  use  the  same
              platformFamily value as the service (for example, LINUX ).

          taskDefinition -> (string)
              The  task definition to use for tasks in the service. This value
              is specified when the service is created with   CreateService  ,
              and it can be modified with  UpdateService .

          deploymentConfiguration -> (structure)
              Optional  deployment  parameters that control how many tasks run
              during the deployment and the ordering of stopping and  starting
              tasks.

              deploymentCircuitBreaker -> (structure)

                 NOTE:
                     The  deployment circuit breaker can only be used for ser-
                     vices using the rolling update (ECS ) deployment type.

                 The deployment circuit breaker determines whether  a  service
                 deployment  will  fail  if  the  service can't reach a steady
                 state. If deployment circuit breaker is  enabled,  a  service
                 deployment will transition to a failed state and stop launch-
                 ing new tasks. If rollback is enabled, when a service deploy-
                 ment fails, the service is rolled back to the last deployment
                 that completed successfully.

                 enable -> (boolean)
                     Determines  whether  to  enable  the  deployment  circuit
                     breaker logic for the service.

                 rollback -> (boolean)
                     Determines  whether to enable Amazon ECS to roll back the
                     service if a service deployment fails. If rollback is en-
                     abled,  when  a  service deployment fails, the service is
                     rolled back to the last deployment  that  completed  suc-
                     cessfully.

              maximumPercent -> (integer)
                 If  a  service  is using the rolling update (ECS ) deployment
                 type, the maximum percent parameter represents an upper limit
                 on  the  number of tasks in a service that are allowed in the
                 RUNNING or PENDING state during a deployment, as a percentage
                 of  the  desired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest
                 integer), and while any container instances are in the DRAIN-
                 ING  state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch
                 type. This parameter enables you  to  define  the  deployment
                 batch size. For example, if your service has a desired number
                 of four tasks and a maximum percent value of 200%, the sched-
                 uler  may start four new tasks before stopping the four older
                 tasks (provided that the cluster  resources  required  to  do
                 this are available). The default value for maximum percent is
                 200%.

                 If a service is using the blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY ) or EXTER-
                 NAL  deployment types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type,
                 the maximum percent value is set to the default value and  is
                 used  to define the upper limit on the number of the tasks in
                 the service that remain in the RUNNING state while  the  con-
                 tainer  instances  are in the DRAINING state. If the tasks in
                 the service use the Fargate launch type, the maximum  percent
                 value  is  not  used, although it is returned when describing
                 your service.

              minimumHealthyPercent -> (integer)
                 If a service is using the rolling update  (ECS  )  deployment
                 type, the minimum healthy percent represents a lower limit on
                 the number of tasks in a service that must remain in the RUN-
                 NING  state  during  a deployment, as a percentage of the de-
                 sired number of tasks (rounded up to  the  nearest  integer),
                 and  while  any container instances are in the DRAINING state
                 if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This
                 parameter  enables  you  to  deploy  without using additional
                 cluster capacity. For example, if your service has a  desired
                 number  of  four  tasks and a minimum healthy percent of 50%,
                 the scheduler may stop two existing tasks to free up  cluster
                 capacity  before  starting  two new tasks. Tasks for services
                 that do not use a load balancer  are  considered  healthy  if
                 they're  in the RUNNING state; tasks for services that do use
                 a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUN-
                 NING  state  and they're reported as healthy by the load bal-
                 ancer. The default value for minimum healthy percent is 100%.

                 If a service is using the blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY ) or EXTER-
                 NAL  deployment types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type,
                 the minimum healthy percent value is set to the default value
                 and  is  used  to define the lower limit on the number of the
                 tasks in the service that remain in the RUNNING  state  while
                 the  container  instances  are  in the DRAINING state. If the
                 tasks in the service use the Fargate launch type, the minimum
                 healthy  percent  value  is not used, although it is returned
                 when describing your service.

          taskSets -> (list)
              Information about a set of Amazon ECS tasks in either an CodeDe-
              ploy  or an EXTERNAL deployment. An Amazon ECS task set includes
              details such as the desired number of tasks, how many tasks  are
              running, and whether the task set serves production traffic.

              (structure)
                 Information about a set of Amazon ECS tasks in either an Cod-
                 eDeploy or an EXTERNAL deployment. An Amazon ECS task set in-
                 cludes  details such as the desired number of tasks, how many
                 tasks are running, and whether the task set serves production
                 traffic.

                 id -> (string)
                     The ID of the task set.

                 taskSetArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task set.

                 serviceArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the service the task
                     set exists in.

                 clusterArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  cluster  that  the
                     service that hosts the task set exists in.

                 startedBy -> (string)
                     The  tag specified when a task set is started. If an Cod-
                     eDeploy deployment created the task  set,  the  startedBy
                     parameter is CODE_DEPLOY . If an external deployment cre-
                     ated the task set, the startedBy field isn't used.

                 externalId -> (string)
                     The external ID associated with the task set.

                     If an CodeDeploy deployment created a task set,  the  ex-
                     ternalId parameter contains the CodeDeploy deployment ID.

                     If  a  task set is created for an external deployment and
                     is associated with a service discovery registry, the  ex-
                     ternalId  parameter contains the ECS_TASK_SET_EXTERNAL_ID
                     Cloud Map attribute.

                 status -> (string)
                     The status of the task set. The following describes  each
                     state.
                        PRIMARY

                     The task set is serving production traffic.
                        ACTIVE

                     The task set isn't serving production traffic.
                        DRAINING

                     The  tasks  in  the task set are being stopped, and their
                     corresponding targets are being deregistered  from  their
                     target group.

                 taskDefinition -> (string)
                     The task definition that the task set is using.

                 computedDesiredCount -> (integer)
                     The computed desired count for the task set. This is cal-
                     culated by multiplying the service's desiredCount by  the
                     task set's scale percentage. The result is always rounded
                     up. For example, if the computed desired count is 1.2, it
                     rounds up to 2 tasks.

                 pendingCount -> (integer)
                     The number of tasks in the task set that are in the PEND-
                     ING status during a deployment. A  task  in  the  PENDING
                     state is preparing to enter the RUNNING state. A task set
                     enters the PENDING status when it launches for the  first
                     time  or  when  it's restarted after being in the STOPPED
                     state.

                 runningCount -> (integer)
                     The number of tasks in the task set that are in the  RUN-
                     NING  status  during  a deployment. A task in the RUNNING
                     state is running and ready for use.

                 createdAt -> (timestamp)
                     The Unix timestamp for the time when  the  task  set  was
                     created.

                 updatedAt -> (timestamp)
                     The  Unix  timestamp  for  the time when the task set was
                     last updated.

                 launchType -> (string)
                     The launch type the tasks in the task set are using.  For
                     more information, see Amazon ECS launch types in the Ama-
                     zon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                 capacityProviderStrategy -> (list)
                     The capacity provider strategy that are  associated  with
                     the task set.

                     (structure)
                        The  details of a capacity provider strategy. A capac-
                        ity provider strategy can be set when using the   Run-
                        Task or  CreateCluster APIs or as the default capacity
                        provider strategy for a cluster with the   CreateClus-
                        ter API.

                        Only  capacity  providers  that are already associated
                        with a cluster and have an ACTIVE or  UPDATING  status
                        can be used in a capacity provider strategy. The  Put-
                        ClusterCapacityProviders API is used  to  associate  a
                        capacity provider with a cluster.

                        If  specifying  a  capacity provider that uses an Auto
                        Scaling group, the capacity provider must  already  be
                        created. New Auto Scaling group capacity providers can
                        be created with the  CreateCapacityProvider API opera-
                        tion.

                        To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either the
                        FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers.  The  Far-
                        gate  capacity providers are available to all accounts
                        and only need to be associated with a  cluster  to  be
                        used in a capacity provider strategy.

                        A  capacity provider strategy may contain a maximum of
                        6 capacity providers.

                        capacityProvider -> (string)
                            The short name of the capacity provider.

                        weight -> (integer)
                            The weight value designates the relative  percent-
                            age  of  the  total  number of tasks launched that
                            should use the specified  capacity  provider.  The
                            weight value is taken into consideration after the
                            base value, if defined, is satisfied.

                            If no weight value is specified, the default value
                            of 0 is used. When multiple capacity providers are
                            specified within a capacity provider strategy,  at
                            least  one  of  the capacity providers must have a
                            weight value greater than zero  and  any  capacity
                            providers  with  a  weight  of  0 can't be used to
                            place tasks.  If  you  specify  multiple  capacity
                            providers  in a strategy that all have a weight of
                            0 , any RunTask or CreateService actions using the
                            capacity provider strategy will fail.

                            An  example scenario for using weights is defining
                            a strategy that contains  two  capacity  providers
                            and  both  have a weight of 1 , then when the base
                            is satisfied,  the  tasks  will  be  split  evenly
                            across the two capacity providers. Using that same
                            logic, if you specify a weight of  1  for  capaci-
                            tyProviderA   and   a  weight  of  4  for  capaci-
                            tyProviderB , then for every one task  that's  run
                            using capacityProviderA , four tasks would use ca-
                            pacityProviderB .

                        base -> (integer)
                            The base value designates how  many  tasks,  at  a
                            minimum,   to   run   on  the  specified  capacity
                            provider. Only one capacity provider in a capacity
                            provider  strategy  can have a base defined. If no
                            value is specified, the  default  value  of  0  is
                            used.

                 platformVersion -> (string)
                     The  Fargate platform version where the tasks in the task
                     set are running. A platform version is only specified for
                     tasks  run  on Fargate. For more information, see Fargate
                     platform versions in the Amazon Elastic Container Service
                     Developer Guide .

                 platformFamily -> (string)
                     The  operating system that your tasks in the set are run-
                     ning on. A platform family is specified  only  for  tasks
                     that use the Fargate launch type.

                     All tasks in the set must have the same value.

                 networkConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The network configuration for the task set.

                     awsvpcConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The  VPC  subnets and security groups that are associ-
                        ated with a task.

                        NOTE:
                            All specified subnets and security groups must  be
                            from the same VPC.

                        subnets -> (list)
                            The IDs of the subnets associated with the task or
                            service. There's a limit of 16 subnets that can be
                            specified per AwsVpcConfiguration .

                            NOTE:
                               All  specified  subnets  must  be from the same
                               VPC.

                            (string)

                        securityGroups -> (list)
                            The IDs of the security groups associated with the
                            task  or  service. If you don't specify a security
                            group, the default security group for the  VPC  is
                            used.  There's  a  limit of 5 security groups that
                            can be specified per AwsVpcConfiguration .

                            NOTE:
                               All specified security groups must be from  the
                               same VPC.

                            (string)

                        assignPublicIp -> (string)
                            Whether  the  task's elastic network interface re-
                            ceives a public IP address. The default  value  is
                            DISABLED .

                 loadBalancers -> (list)
                     Details on a load balancer that are used with a task set.

                     (structure)
                        The  load balancer configuration to use with a service
                        or task set.

                        For specific notes and restrictions regarding the  use
                        of load balancers with services and task sets, see the
                        CreateService and CreateTaskSet actions.

                        targetGroupArn -> (string)
                            The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Elastic
                            Load  Balancing  target group or groups associated
                            with a service or task set.

                            A target group ARN is only specified when using an
                            Application  Load  Balancer  or  Network Load Bal-
                            ancer. If you're using a  Classic  Load  Balancer,
                            omit the target group ARN.

                            For  services using the ECS deployment controller,
                            you can specify one or multiple target groups. For
                            more  information, see Registering Multiple Target
                            Groups with a Service in the Amazon  Elastic  Con-

                            For services using the CODE_DEPLOY deployment con-
                            troller, you're  required  to  define  two  target
                            groups  for  the  load balancer. For more informa-

                            WARNING:
                               If your  service's  task  definition  uses  the
                               awsvpc  network mode, you must choose ip as the
                               target type, not instance . Do this when creat-
                               ing  your  target groups because tasks that use
                               the awsvpc network mode are associated with  an
                               elastic  network  interface,  not an Amazon EC2
                               instance. This network mode is required for the
                               Fargate launch type.

                        loadBalancerName -> (string)
                            The  name  of  the load balancer to associate with
                            the Amazon ECS service or task set.

                            A load balancer name is only specified when  using
                            a  Classic  Load Balancer. If you are using an Ap-
                            plication Load Balancer or a Network Load Balancer
                            the  load  balancer name parameter should be omit-
                            ted.

                        containerName -> (string)
                            The name of the container (as it appears in a con-
                            tainer definition) to associate with the load bal-
                            ancer.

                        containerPort -> (integer)
                            The port on the container to  associate  with  the
                            load balancer. This port must correspond to a con-
                            tainerPort in the task definition the tasks in the
                            service  are  using.  For  tasks  that use the EC2
                            launch  type,  the  container   instance   they're
                            launched  on  must  allow  ingress  traffic on the
                            hostPort of the port mapping.

                 serviceRegistries -> (list)
                     The details for the service discovery registries  to  as-
                     sign  to this task set. For more information, see Service
                     discovery .

                     (structure)
                        The details for the service registry.

                        registryArn -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service reg-
                            istry. The currently supported service registry is
                            Cloud Map. For more information, see CreateService
                            .

                        port -> (integer)
                            The port value used if your service discovery ser-
                            vice specified an SRV record. This field might  be
                            used  if  both  the  awsvpc  network  mode and SRV
                            records are used.

                        containerName -> (string)
                            The container name value to be used for your  ser-
                            vice  discovery service. It's already specified in
                            the task definition. If the task  definition  that
                            your  service  task  specifies  uses the bridge or
                            host network mode, you must specify  a  container-
                            Name  and  containerPort combination from the task
                            definition. If the task definition that your  ser-
                            vice  task  specifies uses the awsvpc network mode
                            and a type SRV DNS record is used, you must  spec-
                            ify  either a containerName and containerPort com-
                            bination or a port value. However, you can't spec-
                            ify both.

                        containerPort -> (integer)
                            The port value to be used for your service discov-
                            ery service. It's already specified  in  the  task
                            definition.  If  the  task definition your service
                            task specifies uses the  bridge  or  host  network
                            mode,  you  must  specify a containerName and con-
                            tainerPort combination from the  task  definition.
                            If the task definition your service task specifies
                            uses the awsvpc network mode and a  type  SRV  DNS
                            record is used, you must specify either a contain-
                            erName and containerPort  combination  or  a  port
                            value. However, you can't specify both.

                 scale -> (structure)
                     A  floating-point  percentage  of  your desired number of
                     tasks to place and keep running in the task set.

                     value -> (double)
                        The value, specified as a percent total of a service's
                        desiredCount  , to scale the task set. Accepted values
                        are numbers between 0 and 100.

                     unit -> (string)
                        The unit of measure for the scale value.

                 stabilityStatus -> (string)
                     The stability status. This indicates whether the task set
                     has  reached  a steady state. If the following conditions
                     are met, the task set sre in STEADY_STATE :

                     o The task runningCount is equal to the  computedDesired-
                       Count .

                     o The pendingCount is 0 .

                     o There  are  no  tasks that are running on container in-
                       stances in the DRAINING status.

                     o All tasks are reporting a healthy status from the  load
                       balancers,  service  discovery,  and  container  health
                       checks.

                     If any of those conditions aren't met, the stability sta-
                     tus returns STABILIZING .

                 stabilityStatusAt -> (timestamp)
                     The Unix timestamp for the time when the task set stabil-
                     ity status was retrieved.

                 tags -> (list)
                     The metadata that you apply to the task set to  help  you
                     categorize  and organize them. Each tag consists of a key
                     and an optional value. You define both.

                     The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                     o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                     o For each resource, each tag key  must  be  unique,  and
                       each tag key can have only one value.

                     o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                     o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                     o If your tagging schema is used across multiple services
                       and resources, remember that other  services  may  have
                       restrictions  on  allowed characters. Generally allowed
                       characters are: letters,  numbers,  and  spaces  repre-
                       sentable  in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - =
                       . _ : / @.

                     o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                     o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase com-
                       bination  of such as a prefix for either keys or values
                       as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You can-
                       not edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix.
                       Tags with this prefix do not count  against  your  tags
                       per resource limit.

                     (structure)
                        The  metadata that you apply to a resource to help you
                        categorize and organize them. Each tag consists  of  a
                        key and an optional value. You define them.

                        The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                        o Maximum value length -  256  Unicode  characters  in
                          UTF-8

                        o If  your tagging schema is used across multiple ser-
                          vices and resources, remember  that  other  services
                          may  have restrictions on allowed characters. Gener-
                          ally allowed characters are: letters,  numbers,  and
                          spaces  representable  in  UTF-8,  and the following
                          characters: + - = . _ : / @.

                        o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                        o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper  or  lowercase
                          combination  of  such as a prefix for either keys or
                          values as it is reserved  for  Amazon  Web  Services
                          use.  You  cannot  edit or delete tag keys or values
                          with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count
                          against your tags per resource limit.

                        key -> (string)
                            One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A
                            key is a general label that acts like  a  category
                            for more specific tag values.

                        value -> (string)
                            The optional part of a key-value pair that make up
                            a tag. A value acts as a descriptor within  a  tag
                            category (key).

          deployments -> (list)
              The current state of deployments for the service.

              (structure)
                 The details of an Amazon ECS service deployment. This is used
                 only when a service uses the ECS deployment controller type.

                 id -> (string)
                     The ID of the deployment.

                 status -> (string)
                     The status of the  deployment.  The  following  describes
                     each state.
                        PRIMARY

                     The most recent deployment of a service.
                        ACTIVE

                     A  service  deployment  that still has running tasks, but
                     are in the process of being replaced with a  new  PRIMARY
                     deployment.
                        INACTIVE

                     A deployment that has been completely replaced.

                 taskDefinition -> (string)
                     The  most  recent  task definition that was specified for
                     the tasks in the service to use.

                 desiredCount -> (integer)
                     The most recent desired count of tasks that was specified
                     for the service to deploy or maintain.

                 pendingCount -> (integer)
                     The  number  of  tasks  in the deployment that are in the
                     PENDING status.

                 runningCount -> (integer)
                     The number of tasks in the deployment  that  are  in  the
                     RUNNING status.

                 failedTasks -> (integer)
                     The  number  of consecutively failed tasks in the deploy-
                     ment. A task is  considered  a  failure  if  the  service
                     scheduler can't launch the task, the task doesn't transi-
                     tion to a RUNNING state, or if it fails any  of  its  de-
                     fined health checks and is stopped.

                     NOTE:
                        Once a service deployment has one or more successfully
                        running tasks, the failed task count  resets  to  zero
                        and stops being evaluated.

                 createdAt -> (timestamp)
                     The  Unix timestamp for the time when the service deploy-
                     ment was created.

                 updatedAt -> (timestamp)
                     The Unix timestamp for the time when the service  deploy-
                     ment was last updated.

                 capacityProviderStrategy -> (list)
                     The capacity provider strategy that the deployment is us-
                     ing.

                     (structure)
                        The details of a capacity provider strategy. A  capac-
                        ity  provider strategy can be set when using the  Run-
                        Task or  CreateCluster APIs or as the default capacity
                        provider  strategy for a cluster with the  CreateClus-
                        ter API.

                        Only capacity providers that  are  already  associated
                        with  a  cluster and have an ACTIVE or UPDATING status
                        can be used in a capacity provider strategy. The  Put-
                        ClusterCapacityProviders  API  is  used to associate a
                        capacity provider with a cluster.

                        If specifying a capacity provider that  uses  an  Auto
                        Scaling  group,  the capacity provider must already be
                        created. New Auto Scaling group capacity providers can
                        be created with the  CreateCapacityProvider API opera-
                        tion.

                        To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either the
                        FARGATE  or  FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers. The Far-
                        gate capacity providers are available to all  accounts
                        and  only  need  to be associated with a cluster to be
                        used in a capacity provider strategy.

                        A capacity provider strategy may contain a maximum  of
                        6 capacity providers.

                        capacityProvider -> (string)
                            The short name of the capacity provider.

                        weight -> (integer)
                            The  weight value designates the relative percent-
                            age of the total number  of  tasks  launched  that
                            should  use  the  specified capacity provider. The
                            weight value is taken into consideration after the
                            base value, if defined, is satisfied.

                            If no weight value is specified, the default value
                            of 0 is used. When multiple capacity providers are
                            specified  within a capacity provider strategy, at
                            least one of the capacity providers  must  have  a
                            weight  value  greater  than zero and any capacity
                            providers with a weight of  0  can't  be  used  to
                            place  tasks.  If  you  specify  multiple capacity
                            providers in a strategy that all have a weight  of
                            0 , any RunTask or CreateService actions using the
                            capacity provider strategy will fail.

                            An example scenario for using weights is  defining
                            a  strategy  that  contains two capacity providers
                            and both have a weight of 1 , then when  the  base
                            is  satisfied,  the  tasks  will  be  split evenly
                            across the two capacity providers. Using that same
                            logic,  if  you  specify a weight of 1 for capaci-
                            tyProviderA  and  a  weight  of  4   for   capaci-
                            tyProviderB  ,  then for every one task that's run
                            using capacityProviderA , four tasks would use ca-
                            pacityProviderB .

                        base -> (integer)
                            The  base  value  designates  how many tasks, at a
                            minimum,  to  run  on   the   specified   capacity
                            provider. Only one capacity provider in a capacity
                            provider strategy can have a base defined.  If  no
                            value  is  specified,  the  default  value of 0 is
                            used.

                 launchType -> (string)
                     The launch type the tasks in the service are  using.  For
                     more information, see Amazon ECS Launch Types in the Ama-
                     zon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                 platformVersion -> (string)
                     The platform version that your tasks in the  service  run
                     on.  A platform version is only specified for tasks using
                     the Fargate launch type. If one isn't specified, the LAT-
                     EST  platform  version is used. For more information, see
                     Fargate Platform Versions in the Amazon Elastic Container
                     Service Developer Guide .

                 platformFamily -> (string)
                     The  operating  system that your tasks in the service, or
                     tasks are running on. A platform family is specified only
                     for tasks using the Fargate launch type.

                     All  tasks  that run as part of this service must use the
                     same platformFamily value as the  service,  for  example,
                     LINUX. .

                 networkConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The VPC subnet and security group configuration for tasks
                     that receive their own elastic network interface by using
                     the awsvpc networking mode.

                     awsvpcConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The  VPC  subnets and security groups that are associ-
                        ated with a task.

                        NOTE:
                            All specified subnets and security groups must  be
                            from the same VPC.

                        subnets -> (list)
                            The IDs of the subnets associated with the task or
                            service. There's a limit of 16 subnets that can be
                            specified per AwsVpcConfiguration .

                            NOTE:
                               All  specified  subnets  must  be from the same
                               VPC.

                            (string)

                        securityGroups -> (list)
                            The IDs of the security groups associated with the
                            task  or  service. If you don't specify a security
                            group, the default security group for the  VPC  is
                            used.  There's  a  limit of 5 security groups that
                            can be specified per AwsVpcConfiguration .

                            NOTE:
                               All specified security groups must be from  the
                               same VPC.

                            (string)

                        assignPublicIp -> (string)
                            Whether  the  task's elastic network interface re-
                            ceives a public IP address. The default  value  is
                            DISABLED .

                 rolloutState -> (string)

                     NOTE:
                        The  rolloutState  of  a  service is only returned for
                        services that use the rolling update (ECS ) deployment
                        type that aren't behind a Classic Load Balancer.

                     The  rollout  state of the deployment. When a service de-
                     ployment is started, it begins in an  IN_PROGRESS  state.
                     When  the  service reaches a steady state, the deployment
                     transitions to a COMPLETED state. If the service fails to
                     reach  a steady state and circuit breaker is enabled, the
                     deployment transitions to a FAILED state. A deployment in
                     FAILED  state  doesn't launch any new tasks. For more in-
                     formation, see  DeploymentCircuitBreaker .

                 rolloutStateReason -> (string)
                     A description of the rollout state of a deployment.

          roleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the IAM role that's associated with the  service.  It
              allows  the Amazon ECS container agent to register container in-
              stances with an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer.

          events -> (list)
              The event stream for your service. A maximum of 100 of the  lat-
              est events are displayed.

              (structure)
                 The details for an event that's associated with a service.

                 id -> (string)
                     The ID string for the event.

                 createdAt -> (timestamp)
                     The  Unix timestamp for the time when the event was trig-
                     gered.

                 message -> (string)
                     The event message.

          createdAt -> (timestamp)
              The Unix timestamp for the time when the service was created.

          placementConstraints -> (list)
              The placement constraints for the tasks in the service.

              (structure)
                 An object representing a constraint on  task  placement.  For
                 more  information, see Task Placement Constraints in the Ama-
                 zon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                 NOTE:
                     If you're using the Fargate launch type,  task  placement
                     constraints aren't supported.

                 type -> (string)
                     The  type  of  constraint. Use distinctInstance to ensure
                     that each task in a particular group is running on a dif-
                     ferent  container  instance. Use memberOf to restrict the
                     selection to a group of valid candidates.

                 expression -> (string)
                     A cluster query language expression to apply to the  con-
                     straint. The expression can have a maximum length of 2000
                     characters. You can't specify an expression if  the  con-
                     straint  type is distinctInstance . For more information,
                     see Cluster query language in  the  Amazon  Elastic  Con-
                     tainer Service Developer Guide .

          placementStrategy -> (list)
              The placement strategy that determines how tasks for the service
              are placed.

              (structure)
                 The task placement strategy for a task or service.  For  more
                 information,  see  Task  Placement  Strategies  in the Amazon
                 Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of  placement  strategy.  The  random  placement
                     strategy  randomly  places tasks on available candidates.
                     The spread placement strategy  spreads  placement  across
                     available candidates evenly based on the field parameter.
                     The binpack strategy places tasks on available candidates
                     that  have  the  least  available  amount of the resource
                     that's specified with the field parameter.  For  example,
                     if  you  binpack  on  memory, a task is placed on the in-
                     stance with the least  amount  of  remaining  memory  but
                     still enough to run the task.

                 field -> (string)
                     The  field  to  apply the placement strategy against. For
                     the spread placement strategy, valid values  are  instan-
                     ceId  (or host , which has the same effect), or any plat-
                     form or custom attribute that's applied  to  a  container
                     instance,  such  as attribute:ecs.availability-zone . For
                     the binpack placement strategy, valid values are cpu  and
                     memory . For the random placement strategy, this field is
                     not used.

          networkConfiguration -> (structure)
              The VPC subnet and security group configuration for  tasks  that
              receive  their own elastic network interface by using the awsvpc
              networking mode.

              awsvpcConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The VPC subnets and security groups that are associated  with
                 a task.

                 NOTE:
                     All  specified  subnets  and security groups must be from
                     the same VPC.

                 subnets -> (list)
                     The IDs of the subnets associated with the task  or  ser-
                     vice. There's a limit of 16 subnets that can be specified
                     per AwsVpcConfiguration .

                     NOTE:
                        All specified subnets must be from the same VPC.

                     (string)

                 securityGroups -> (list)
                     The IDs of the security groups associated with  the  task
                     or  service.  If  you don't specify a security group, the
                     default security group for the VPC  is  used.  There's  a
                     limit  of  5  security  groups  that can be specified per
                     AwsVpcConfiguration .

                     NOTE:
                        All specified security groups must be  from  the  same
                        VPC.

                     (string)

                 assignPublicIp -> (string)
                     Whether  the  task's elastic network interface receives a
                     public IP address. The default value is DISABLED .

          healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds -> (integer)
              The period of time, in seconds,  that  the  Amazon  ECS  service
              scheduler ignores unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing target health
              checks after a task has first started.

          schedulingStrategy -> (string)
              The scheduling strategy to use for the service. For more  infor-
              mation, see Services .

              There are two service scheduler strategies available.

              o REPLICA  -The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains
                the desired number of tasks across your cluster.  By  default,
                the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones.
                You can use task placement strategies and constraints to  cus-
                tomize task placement decisions.

              o DAEMON  -The  daemon  scheduling  strategy deploys exactly one
                task on each active container instance. This taskmeets all  of
                the  task placement constraints that you specify in your clus-
                ter. The service scheduler also evaluates the  task  placement
                constraints  for  running tasks. It stop tasks that don't meet
                the placement constraints.

              NOTE:
                 Fargate tasks don't support the DAEMON scheduling strategy.

          deploymentController -> (structure)
              The deployment controller type the service is using. When  using
              the  DescribeServices  API, this field is omitted if the service
              uses the ECS deployment controller type.

              type -> (string)
                 The deployment controller type to use.

                 There are three deployment controller types available:
                     ECS

                 The rolling update (ECS ) deployment type involves  replacing
                 the  current running version of the container with the latest
                 version. The number of containers Amazon ECS adds or  removes
                 from the service during a rolling update is controlled by ad-
                 justing the minimum and maximum number of healthy  tasks  al-
                 lowed  during  a service deployment, as specified in the  De-
                 ploymentConfiguration .
                     CODE_DEPLOY

                 The  blue/green  (CODE_DEPLOY  )  deployment  type  uses  the
                 blue/green  deployment model powered by CodeDeploy, which al-
                 lows you to verify a new deployment of a service before send-
                 ing production traffic to it.
                     EXTERNAL

                 The  external  (EXTERNAL ) deployment type enables you to use
                 any third-party deployment controller for full  control  over
                 the deployment process for an Amazon ECS service.

          tags -> (list)
              The  metadata  that you apply to the service to help you catego-
              rize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key  and  an  op-
              tional value. You define bot the key and value.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

              o For  each  resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o If your tagging schema is used across  multiple  services  and
                resources,  remember that other services may have restrictions
                on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are:  let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
                lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.

              o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

              o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination
                of  such  as  a  prefix for either keys or values as it is re-
                served for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or  delete
                tag  keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do
                not count against your tags per resource limit.

              (structure)
                 The metadata that you apply to a resource to help you catego-
                 rize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an op-
                 tional value. You define them.

                 The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                 o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                 o For each resource, each tag key must be  unique,  and  each
                   tag key can have only one value.

                 o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
                   resources, remember that other services may  have  restric-
                   tions  on  allowed characters. Generally allowed characters
                   are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable  in  UTF-8,
                   and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.

                 o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                 o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combina-
                   tion of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is
                   reserved  for  Amazon  Web Services use. You cannot edit or
                   delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with  this
                   prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.

                 key -> (string)
                     One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is
                     a general label that acts like a category for  more  spe-
                     cific tag values.

                 value -> (string)
                     The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a tag.
                     A value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

          createdBy -> (string)
              The principal that created the service.

          enableECSManagedTags -> (boolean)
              Determines whether to enable Amazon ECS  managed  tags  for  the
              tasks  in  the  service.  For more information, see Tagging Your
              Amazon ECS Resources in the Amazon Elastic Container Service De-
              veloper Guide .

          propagateTags -> (string)
              Determines  whether  to propagate the tags from the task defini-
              tion or the service to the task. If no value is  specified,  the
              tags aren't propagated.

          enableExecuteCommand -> (boolean)
              Determines  whether the execute command functionality is enabled
              for the service. If true , the execute command functionality  is
              enabled for all containers in tasks as part of the service.
