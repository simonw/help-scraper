START-TASK()                                                      START-TASK()



NAME
       start-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  a  new task from the specified task definition on the specified
       container instance or instances.

       NOTE:
          On March 21, 2024, a change was made to resolve the task  definition
          revision  before  authorization.  When a task definition revision is
          not specified, authorization will occur using the latest revision of
          a task definition.

       Starting  April 15, 2023, Amazon Web Services will not onboard new cus-
       tomers to Amazon Elastic Inference (EI), and  will  help  current  cus-
       tomers  migrate  their workloads to options that offer better price and
       performance. After April 15, 2023, new customers will not  be  able  to
       launch  instances with Amazon EI accelerators in Amazon SageMaker, Ama-
       zon ECS, or Amazon EC2. However, customers who have used Amazon  EI  at
       least  once  during  the past 30-day period are considered current cus-
       tomers and will be able to continue using the service.

       Alternatively, you can use``RunTask`` to place tasks for you. For  more
       information,  see Scheduling Tasks in the Amazon Elastic Container Ser-
       vice Developer Guide .

       You can attach Amazon EBS volumes to Amazon ECS  tasks  by  configuring
       the  volume  when  creating or updating a service. For more infomation,
       see Amazon EBS volumes in the Amazon Elastic Container  Service  Devel-
       oper Guide .

          fault cluster is assumed.

       --container-instances (list)
          The container instance IDs or full ARN entries for the container in-
          stances where you would like to place your task. You can specify  up
          to 10 container instances.

          on all containers in the task.

       --group (string)
          The  name  of the task group to associate with the task. The default
          value is the family name of the task definition (for  example,  fam-
          ily:my-family-name).

       --network-configuration (structure)
          The  VPC  subnet and security group configuration for tasks that re-
          ceive their own elastic network interface by using the  awsvpc  net-
          working mode.

          awsvpcConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  VPC  subnets and security groups that are associated with a
              task.

                 (string)

              securityGroups -> (list)
                 The  IDs  of  the security groups associated with the task or
                 service. If you don't specify a security group,  the  default
                 security  group for the VPC is used. There's a limit of 5 se-
                 curity groups that can be specified per awsvpcConfiguration .

                 NOTE:
                     All specified security groups must be from the same VPC.

              assignPublicIp -> (string)
                 Whether the task's elastic network interface receives a  pub-
                 lic IP address. The default value is DISABLED .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[string,string],securityGroups=[string,string],assignPublicIp=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "awsvpcConfiguration": {
              "subnets": ["string", ...],
              "securityGroups": ["string", ...],
              "assignPublicIp": "ENABLED"|"DISABLED"
            }
          }

       --overrides (structure)
          A  list  of container overrides in JSON format that specify the name
          of a container in the specified task definition and the overrides it
          receives.  You  can  override  the  default  command for a container
          (that's specified in the task definition or  Docker  image)  with  a
          command  override.  You can also override existing environment vari-
          ables (that are specified in the task definition or Docker image) on
          a  container or add new environment variables to it with an environ-
          ment override.

          NOTE:
              A total of 8192 characters are allowed for overrides. This limit
              includes  the  JSON formatting characters of the override struc-
              ture.

          containerOverrides -> (list)
              One or more container overrides that are sent to a task.

              (structure)
                 The overrides that are sent to a  container.  An  empty  con-
                 tainer override can be passed in. An example of an empty con-
                 tainer override is  {"containerOverrides":  [  ]  }  .  If  a
                 non-empty container override is specified, the name parameter
                 must be included.

                 You can use Secrets Manager or Amazon  Web  Services  Systems
                 Manager Parameter Store to store the sensitive data. For more
                 information, see Retrieve secrets through  environment  vari-
                 ables in the Amazon ECS Developer Guide.

                 name -> (string)
                     The  name  of  the  container that receives the override.
                     This parameter is required if any override is specified.

                 command -> (list)
                     The command to send to the container that  overrides  the
                     default command from the Docker image or the task defini-
                     tion. You must also specify a container name.

                     (string)

                 environment -> (list)
                     The environment variables to send to the  container.  You
                     can add new environment variables, which are added to the
                     container at launch, or you can override the existing en-
                     vironment  variables  from  the  Docker image or the task
                     definition. You must also specify a container name.

                     (structure)
                        A key-value pair object.

                        name -> (string)
                            The name of the key-value  pair.  For  environment
                            variables,  this  is  the  name of the environment
                            variable.

                        value -> (string)
                            The value of the key-value pair.  For  environment
                            variables,  this  is  the value of the environment
                            variable.

                 environmentFiles -> (list)
                     A list of files containing the environment  variables  to
                     pass  to  a container, instead of the value from the con-
                     tainer definition.

                     (structure)
                        A list of files containing the  environment  variables
                        to  pass to a container. You can specify up to ten en-
                        vironment files. The file must have a .env file exten-
                        sion.  Each line in an environment file should contain
                        an  environment  variable  in  VARIABLE=VALUE  format.
                        Lines beginning with # are treated as comments and are
                        ignored.

                        If there are environment variables specified using the
                        environment  parameter in a container definition, they
                        take precedence over the variables contained within an
                        environment  file.  If  multiple environment files are
                        specified that contain the same variable, they're pro-
                        cessed  from  the  top down. We recommend that you use
                        unique variable names. For more information, see Use a
                        file  to  pass environment variables to a container in
                        the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                        Environment variable files are objects  in  Amazon  S3
                        and all Amazon S3 security considerations apply.

                        You  must  use the following platforms for the Fargate
                        launch type:

                        o Linux platform version 1.4.0 or later.

                        o Windows platform version 1.0.0 or later.

                        Consider the following when using the  Fargate  launch
                        type:

                        o The file is handled like a native Docker env-file.

                        o There is no support for shell escape handling.

                        o The  container  entry  point interperts the VARIABLE
                          values.

                        value -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  Amazon  S3
                            object containing the environment variable file.

                        type -> (string)
                            The  file  type  to use. Environment files are ob-
                            jects in Amazon S3. The only supported value is s3
                            .

                 cpu -> (integer)
                     The  number  of cpu units reserved for the container, in-
                     stead of the default value from the task definition.  You
                     must also specify a container name.

                 memory -> (integer)
                     The  hard limit (in MiB) of memory to present to the con-
                     tainer, instead of the default value from the task  defi-
                     nition.  If  your container attempts to exceed the memory
                     specified here, the container is killed.  You  must  also
                     specify a container name.

                 memoryReservation -> (integer)
                     The soft limit (in MiB) of memory to reserve for the con-
                     tainer, instead of the default value from the task  defi-
                     nition. You must also specify a container name.

                 resourceRequirements -> (list)
                     The  type  and  amount  of a resource to assign to a con-
                     tainer, instead of the default value from the task  defi-
                     nition. The only supported resource is a GPU.

                     (structure)
                        The  type and amount of a resource to assign to a con-
                        tainer. The supported  resource  types  are  GPUs  and
                        Elastic  Inference accelerators. For more information,
                        see Working with GPUs on Amazon ECS  or  Working  with
                        Amazon  Elastic  Inference on Amazon ECS in the Amazon
                        Elastic Container Service Developer Guide

                        value -> (string)

                            serves for  the  container.  The  number  of  GPUs
                            that's reserved for all containers in a task can't
                            exceed the number of available GPUs  on  the  con-
                            tainer instance that the task is launched on.

                            When  the type is InferenceAccelerator , the value
                            matches the deviceName for an InferenceAccelerator

       --propagate-tags (string)
          Specifies  whether to propagate the tags from the task definition or
          the service to the task. If no value is specified, the  tags  aren't
          propagated.

          Possible values:

          o TASK_DEFINITION

          o SERVICE

          o NONE

       --reference-id (string)
          The reference ID to use for the task.

       --started-by (string)
          An  optional  tag  specified when a task is started. For example, if
          you automatically trigger a task to run a  batch  process  job,  you
          could  apply  a unique identifier for that job to your task with the
          startedBy parameter. You can then identify  which  tasks  belong  to
          that  job  by  filtering  the  results  of a ListTasks call with the
          startedBy value. Up to 36 letters (uppercase  and  lowercase),  num-
          bers,  hyphens  (-),  forward slash (/), and underscores (_) are al-
          lowed.

          If a task is started by an Amazon ECS service, the startedBy parame-
          ter contains the deployment ID of the service that starts it.

       --tags (list)
          The  metadata  that you apply to the task to help you categorize and
          organize them. Each tag consists of a key  and  an  optional  value,
          both of which you define.

          The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

          o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

          o For  each  resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key
            can have only one value.

          o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

          o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

          o If your tagging schema is used across multiple  services  and  re-
            sources, remember that other services may have restrictions on al-
            lowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters,  num-
            bers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following charac-
            ters: + - = . _ : / @.

          o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

          o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination  of
            such  as  a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for
            Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or  delete  tag  keys  or
            values  with  this  prefix.  Tags  with  this  prefix do not count
            against your tags per resource limit.

          (structure)
              The metadata that you apply to a resource to help you categorize
              and  organize  them.  Each tag consists of a key and an optional
              value. You define them.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

              o For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and  each  tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o If  your  tagging  schema is used across multiple services and
                resources, remember that other services may have  restrictions
                on  allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
                lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.

              o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

              o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination
                of such as a prefix for either keys or values  as  it  is  re-
                served  for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete
                tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix  do
                not count against your tags per resource limit.

              key -> (string)
                 One  part  of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              value -> (string)
                 The  optional  part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --task-definition (string)
          The family and revision (family:revision ) or full ARN of  the  task
          definition  to  start. If a revision isn't specified, the latest AC-
          TIVE revision is used.

       --volume-configurations (list)
          The details of the volume that was configuredAtLaunch . You can con-
          figure  the size, volumeType, IOPS, throughput, snapshot and encryp-
          tion in TaskManagedEBSVolumeConfiguration . The name of  the  volume
          must match the name from the task definition.

          (structure)
              Configuration  settings  for the task volume that was configure-
              dAtLaunch that weren't set during RegisterTaskDef .

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the volume. This value must match the volume name
                 from the Volume object in the task definition.

              managedEBSVolume -> (structure)
                 The  configuration  for the Amazon EBS volume that Amazon ECS
                 creates and manages on your behalf. These settings  are  used
                 to create each Amazon EBS volume, with one volume created for
                 each task. The Amazon EBS volumes are visible in your account
                 in the Amazon EC2 console once they are created.

                 encrypted -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  whether  the volume should be encrypted. If no
                     value is specified, encryption is turned on  by  default.
                     This  parameter  maps 1:1 with the Encrypted parameter of
                     the CreateVolume API in the Amazon EC2 API Reference .

                 kmsKeyId -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) identifier of  the  Amazon
                     Web Services Key Management Service key to use for Amazon
                     EBS encryption. When encryption is turned on and no  Ama-
                     zon Web Services Key Management Service key is specified,
                     the default Amazon Web Services managed  key  for  Amazon
                     EBS  volumes  is  used.  This parameter maps 1:1 with the
                     KmsKeyId parameter of the CreateVolume API in the  Amazon
                     EC2 API Reference .

                     WARNING:
                        Amazon  Web Services authenticates the Amazon Web Ser-
                        vices  Key  Management  Service  key   asynchronously.
                        Therefore, if you specify an ID, alias, or ARN that is
                        invalid, the action can appear to complete, but  even-
                        tually fails.

                 volumeType -> (string)
                     The volume type. This parameter maps 1:1 with the Volume-
                     Type parameter of the CreateVolume API in the Amazon  EC2
                     API Reference . For more information, see Amazon EBS vol-
                     ume types in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

                     The following are the supported volume types.

                     o General Purpose SSD: gp2
                       |
                       gp3

                     System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 904)
                       Inline  substitution_reference   start-string   without
                       end-string.

                     o Provisioned IOPS SSD: io1
                       |
                       io2

                     System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 906)
                       Inline   substitution_reference   start-string  without
                       end-string.

                     o Throughput Optimized HDD: st1

                     o Cold HDD: sc1

                     o Magnetic: standard

                     NOTE:
                        The magnetic volume type is not supported on Fargate.

                 sizeInGiB -> (integer)
                     The size of the volume in GiB. You must specify either  a
                     volume  size  or a snapshot ID. If you specify a snapshot
                     ID, the snapshot size is used for the volume size by  de-
                     fault.  You  can optionally specify a volume size greater
                     than or equal to the snapshot size. This  parameter  maps
                     1:1  with  the  Size parameter of the CreateVolume API in
                     the Amazon EC2 API Reference .

                     The following are the supported volume  size  values  for
                     each volume type.

                     o gp2 and gp3 : 1-16,384

                     o io1 and io2 : 4-16,384

                     o st1 and sc1 : 125-16,384

                     o standard : 1-1,024

                 snapshotId -> (string)
                     The  snapshot  that Amazon ECS uses to create the volume.
                     You must specify either a snapshot ID or a  volume  size.
                     This  parameter maps 1:1 with the SnapshotId parameter of
                     the CreateVolume API in the Amazon EC2 API Reference .

                 iops -> (integer)
                     The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3 ,
                     io1 , and io2 volumes, this represents the number of IOPS
                     that are provisioned for the  volume.  For  gp2  volumes,
                     this  represents  the  baseline performance of the volume
                     and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O  credits
                     for bursting.

                     The  following  are  the supported values for each volume
                     type.

                     o gp3 : 3,000 - 16,000 IOPS

                     o io1 : 100 - 64,000 IOPS

                     o io2 : 100 - 256,000 IOPS

                     This parameter is required for io1 and io2 volume  types.
                     The  default for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS . This parame-
                     ter is not supported for st1 , sc1 , or  standard  volume
                     types.

                     This  parameter  maps  1:1 with the Iops parameter of the
                     CreateVolume API in the Amazon EC2 API Reference .

                 throughput -> (integer)
                     The throughput to provision for a volume, in MiB/s,  with
                     a  maximum  of  1,000 MiB/s. This parameter maps 1:1 with
                     the Throughput parameter of the CreateVolume API  in  the
                     Amazon EC2 API Reference .

                     WARNING:
                        This  parameter  is  only supported for the gp3 volume
                        type.

                 tagSpecifications -> (list)
                     The tags to apply to the volume. Amazon ECS applies  ser-
                     vice-managed  tags  by  default.  This parameter maps 1:1
                     with   the   TagSpecifications.N   parameter    of    the
                     CreateVolume API in the Amazon EC2 API Reference .

                     (structure)
                        The tag specifications of an Amazon EBS volume.

                        resourceType -> (string)
                            The type of volume resource.

                        tags -> (list)
                            The  tags  applied to this Amazon EBS volume. Ama-
                            zonECSCreated and  AmazonECSManaged  are  reserved
                            tags that can't be used.

                            (structure)
                               The  metadata  that  you apply to a resource to
                               help you categorize and organize them. Each tag
                               consists  of  a  key and an optional value. You
                               define them.

                               The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                               o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                               o For each  resource,  each  tag  key  must  be
                                 unique,  and  each  tag key can have only one
                                 value.

                               o Maximum key length - 128  Unicode  characters
                                 in UTF-8

                               o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters
                                 in UTF-8

                               o If your tagging schema is used across  multi-
                                 ple  services  and  resources,  remember that
                                 other services may have restrictions  on  al-
                                 lowed  characters.  Generally allowed charac-
                                 ters are: letters, numbers, and spaces repre-
                                 sentable  in UTF-8, and the following charac-
                                 ters: + - = . _ : / @.

                               o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                               o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or low-
                                 ercase  combination  of  such as a prefix for
                                 either keys or values as it is  reserved  for
                                 Amazon  Web  Services use. You cannot edit or
                                 delete tag keys or values with  this  prefix.
                                 Tags  with  this  prefix do not count against
                                 your tags per resource limit.

                               key -> (string)
                                   One part of a key-value pair that make up a
                                   tag.  A  key  is  a general label that acts
                                   like a category for more specific tag  val-
                                   ues.

                               value -> (string)
                                   The  optional part of a key-value pair that
                                   make up a tag. A value acts as a descriptor
                                   within a tag category (key).

                        propagateTags -> (string)
                            Determines  whether to propagate the tags from the
                            task definition to the Amazon EBS volume. Tags can
                            only  propagate  to  a  SERVICE  specified in Ser-
                            viceVolumeConfiguration . If no  value  is  speci-
                            fied, the tags aren't propagated.

                 roleArn -> (string)
                     The  ARN  of  the IAM role to associate with this volume.
                     This is the Amazon ECS infrastructure IAM  role  that  is
                     used  to  manage your Amazon Web Services infrastructure.
                     We recommend using the  Amazon  ECS-managed  AmazonECSIn-
                     frastructureRolePolicyForVolumes  IAM  policy  with  this
                     role. For more information, see Amazon ECS infrastructure
                     IAM role in the Amazon ECS Developer Guide .

                 terminationPolicy -> (structure)
                     The  termination  policy for the volume when the task ex-
                     its. This provides a way to control  whether  Amazon  ECS
                     terminates the Amazon EBS volume when the task stops.

                     deleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                        Indicates whether the volume should be deleted on when
                        the task stops. If a value of true is specified,  Ama-
                        zon  ECS  deletes the Amazon EBS volume on your behalf
                        when the task goes into the STOPPED state. If no value
                        is  specified, the default value is true is used. When
                        set to false , Amazon ECS leaves the  volume  in  your
                        account.

                 filesystemType -> (string)
                     The  Linux  filesystem  type  for the volume. For volumes
                     created from  a  snapshot,  you  must  specify  the  same
                     filesystem  type that the volume was using when the snap-
                     shot was created. If there is a filesystem type mismatch,
                     the task will fail to start.

                     The  available filesystem types are ext3 , ext4 , and xfs
                     . If no value is specified, the xfs  filesystem  type  is
                     used by default.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                               range.

                               The  following  rules  apply when you specify a
                               containerPortRange :

                               o You must use either the bridge  network  mode
                                 or the awsvpc network mode.

                               o This  parameter is available for both the EC2
                                 and Fargate launch types.

                               o This parameter  is  available  for  both  the
                                 Linux and Windows operating systems.

                               o The  container  instance  must  have at least
                                 version 1.67.0 of the container agent and  at
                                 least  version 1.67.0-1 of the ecs-init pack-
                                 age

                               o You can specify a maximum of 100 port  ranges
                                 per container.

                               o You  do  not  specify  a  hostPortRange . The
                                 value of the hostPortRange is set as follows:

                                 o For containers in a task  with  the  awsvpc
                                   network  mode,  the hostPortRange is set to
                                   the same value as the containerPortRange  .
                                   This is a static mapping strategy.

                                 o For  containers  in  a task with the bridge
                                   network mode, the Amazon  ECS  agent  finds
                                   open  host ports from the default ephemeral
                                   range and passes it to docker to bind  them
                                   to the container ports.

                               o The  containerPortRange  valid values are be-
                                 tween 1 and 65535.

                               o A port can only be included in one port  map-
                                 ping per container.

                               o You cannot specify overlapping port ranges.

                               o The first port in the range must be less than
                                 last port in the range.

                               o Docker  recommends  that  you  turn  off  the
                                 docker-proxy in the Docker daemon config file
                                 when you have a large number  of  ports.  For
                                 more  information,  see  Issue  #11185 on the
                                 Github website. For information about how  to

                 string  using  vCPUs (for example, 1 vCPU or 1 vcpu ). String
                 values are converted to an integer  that  indicates  the  CPU
                 units when the task definition is registered.

                 If  you use the EC2 launch type, this field is optional. Sup-
                 ported values are between 128 CPU  units  (0.125  vCPUs)  and

              healthStatus -> (string)
                 The health status for the task. It's determined by the health
                 of  the  essential  containers  in the task. If all essential
                 containers in the task are reporting as HEALTHY  ,  the  task
                 status  also reports as HEALTHY . If any essential containers
                 in the task are reporting as UNHEALTHY or UNKNOWN , the  task
                 status also reports as UNHEALTHY or UNKNOWN .

                 NOTE:
                     The  Amazon ECS container agent doesn't monitor or report
                     on Docker health checks that are embedded in a  container
                     image  and not specified in the container definition. For
                     example, this includes those specified in a parent  image
                     or  from  the image's Dockerfile. Health check parameters
                     that are specified in a container definition override any
                     Docker  health checks that are found in the container im-
                     age.

                 The amount of memory (in MiB) that the task uses as expressed
                 in a task definition. It can be expressed as an integer using
                 MiB (for example, 1024 ). If it's expressed as a string using
                 GB (for example, 1GB or 1 GB ), it's converted to an  integer
                 indicating the MiB when the task definition is registered.

                 If you use the EC2 launch type, this field is optional.

                 If  you  use the Fargate launch type, this field is required.
                 You must use one of the following values. The value that  you

              overrides -> (structure)
                 One or more container overrides.

                 containerOverrides -> (list)
                     One or more container overrides that are sent to a task.

                     (structure)
                        The overrides that are sent to a container.  An  empty
                        container  override can be passed in. An example of an
                        empty container override is {"containerOverrides": [ ]
                        }  .  If  a non-empty container override is specified,
                        the name parameter must be included.

                        You can use Secrets Manager  or  Amazon  Web  Services
                        Systems Manager Parameter Store to store the sensitive
                        data.  For  more  information,  see  Retrieve  secrets
                        through environment variables in the Amazon ECS Devel-
                        oper Guide.

                        name -> (string)
                            The name of the container that receives the  over-
                            ride.  This  parameter is required if any override
                            is specified.

                        command -> (list)
                            The command to send to the  container  that  over-
                            rides the default command from the Docker image or
                            the task definition. You must also specify a  con-
                            tainer name.

                            (string)

                        environment -> (list)
                            The  environment  variables  to  send  to the con-
                            tainer. You can  add  new  environment  variables,
                            which are added to the container at launch, or you
                            can override the  existing  environment  variables
                            from  the Docker image or the task definition. You
                            must also specify a container name.

                            (structure)
                               A key-value pair object.

                               name -> (string)
                                   The name of the key-value pair.  For  envi-
                                   ronment  variables, this is the name of the
                                   environment variable.

                               value -> (string)
                                   The value of the key-value pair. For  envi-
                                   ronment variables, this is the value of the
                                   environment variable.

                        environmentFiles -> (list)
                            A list of files containing the  environment  vari-
                            ables to pass to a container, instead of the value
                            from the container definition.

                            (structure)
                               A list  of  files  containing  the  environment
                               variables to pass to a container. You can spec-
                               ify up to ten environment files. The file  must
                               have a .env file extension. Each line in an en-
                               vironment file should  contain  an  environment
                               variable in VARIABLE=VALUE format. Lines begin-
                               ning with # are treated as comments and are ig-
                               nored.

                               If  there  are  environment variables specified
                               using the environment parameter in a  container
                               definition, they take precedence over the vari-
                               ables contained within an environment file.  If
                               multiple  environment  files are specified that
                               contain the same  variable,  they're  processed
                               from  the  top  down. We recommend that you use
                               unique variable names.  For  more  information,
                               see Use a file to pass environment variables to
                               a container in  the  Amazon  Elastic  Container
                               Service Developer Guide .

                               You  must  use  the following platforms for the
                               Fargate launch type:

                               o Linux platform version 1.4.0 or later.

                               o Windows platform version 1.0.0 or later.

                               Consider the following when using  the  Fargate
                               launch type:

                               o The  file  is  handled  like  a native Docker
                                 env-file.

                               o There is no support  for  shell  escape  han-
                                 dling.

                               o The  container  entry  point  interperts  the
                                 VARIABLE values.

                               value -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  Ama-
                                   zon  S3  object  containing the environment
                                   variable file.

                               type -> (string)
                                   The file type to use. Environment files are
                                   objects  in  Amazon  S3. The only supported
                                   value is s3 .

                        cpu -> (integer)
                            The number of cpu  units  reserved  for  the  con-
                            tainer, instead of the default value from the task
                            definition. You  must  also  specify  a  container
                            name.

                        memory -> (integer)
                            The  hard  limit  (in MiB) of memory to present to
                            the container, instead of the default  value  from
                            the task definition. If your container attempts to
                            exceed the memory specified here, the container is
                            killed. You must also specify a container name.

                        memoryReservation -> (integer)
                            The  soft  limit (in MiB) of memory to reserve for
                            the container, instead of the default  value  from
                            the  task definition. You must also specify a con-
                            tainer name.

                        resourceRequirements -> (list)
                            The type and amount of a resource to assign  to  a
                            container,  instead  of the default value from the
                            task definition. The only supported resource is  a
                            GPU.

                            (structure)
                               The  type and amount of a resource to assign to
                               a container. The supported resource  types  are
                               GPUs  and  Elastic  Inference accelerators. For
                               more information, see Working with GPUs on Ama-

                                   The value for the specified resource type.

                                   When  the  type  is  GPU , the value is the
                                   number of physical GPUs the Amazon ECS con-
                                   tainer  agent  reserves  for the container.
                                   The number of GPUs that's reserved for  all
                                   containers  in a task can't exceed the num-
                                   ber of available GPUs on the container  in-
                                   stance that the task is launched on.

                                   When the type is InferenceAccelerator , the
                                   value  matches  the   deviceName   for   an
                                   InferenceAccelerator  specified  in  a task
                                   definition.

              platformVersion -> (string)
                 The platform version where your task runs on. A platform ver-
                 sion  is only specified for tasks that use the Fargate launch
                 type. If you didn't specify one, the LATEST platform  version
                 is  used. For more information, see Fargate Platform Versions
                 in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

              platformFamily -> (string)
                 The operating system that your tasks are running on. A  plat-
                 form  family is specified only for tasks that use the Fargate
                 launch type.

                 All tasks that run as part of this service must use the  same
                 platformFamily value as the service (for example, LINUX. ).

              pullStartedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix timestamp for the time when the container image pull

                 The  Unix  timestamp for the time when the task started. More
                 specifically, it's for the time when  the  task  transitioned
                 from the PENDING state to the RUNNING state.

              startedBy -> (string)
                 The  tag  specified  when a task is started. If an Amazon ECS
                 service started the task, the  startedBy  parameter  contains
                 the deployment ID of that service.

              stopCode -> (string)
                 The  stop code indicating why a task was stopped. The stoppe-
                 dReason might contain additional details.

                 For more information about stop code, see Stopped tasks error
                 codes in the Amazon ECS Developer Guide .

              stoppedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  Unix  timestamp  for the time when the task was stopped.
                 More specifically, it's for the time when  the  task  transi-
                 tioned from the RUNNING state to the STOPPED state.

              stoppedReason -> (string)
                 The reason that the task was stopped.

              stoppingAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  Unix  timestamp  for  the time when the task stops. More
                 specifically, it's for the time  when  the  task  transitions
                 from the RUNNING state to STOPPING .

              tags -> (list)
                 The  metadata  that you apply to the task to help you catego-
                 rize and organize the task. Each tag consists of a key and an
                 optional value. You define both the key and value.

                 The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                 o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                 o For  each  resource,  each tag key must be unique, and each
                   tag key can have only one value.

                 o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
                   resources,  remember  that other services may have restric-
                   tions on allowed characters. Generally  allowed  characters
                   are:  letters,  numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8,
                   and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.

                 o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                 o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combina-
                   tion of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is
                   reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You  cannot  edit  or
                   delete  tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this
                   prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.

                 (structure)
                     The metadata that you apply to a  resource  to  help  you
                     categorize  and organize them. Each tag consists of a key
                     and an optional value. You define them.

                     o If your tagging schema is used across multiple services
                       and resources, remember that other  services  may  have
                       restrictions  on  allowed characters. Generally allowed
                       characters are: letters,  numbers,  and  spaces  repre-
                       sentable  in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - =
                       . _ : / @.

                     o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                     o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase com-
                       bination  of such as a prefix for either keys or values
                       as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You can-
                       not edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix.
                       Tags with this prefix do not count  against  your  tags
                       per resource limit.

                     key -> (string)
                        One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key
                        is a general label that acts like a category for  more
                        specific tag values.

                     value -> (string)
                        The  optional  part of a key-value pair that make up a
                        tag. A value acts as a descriptor within a  tag  cate-
                        gory (key).

              taskArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task.

              taskDefinitionArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the task definition that creates the task.

              version -> (long)
                 The  version  counter for the task. Every time a task experi-
                 ences a change that starts a CloudWatch  event,  the  version
                 counter is incremented. If you replicate your Amazon ECS task
                 state with CloudWatch Events, you can compare the version  of
                 a  task  reported by the Amazon ECS API actions with the ver-
                 sion reported in CloudWatch Events for the task  (inside  the
                 detail  object)  to  verify  that  the  version in your event
                 stream is current.

              ephemeralStorage -> (structure)
                 The ephemeral storage settings for the task.

                 sizeInGiB -> (integer)
                     The total amount, in GiB, of ephemeral storage to set for
                     the  task.  The minimum supported value is 20 GiB and the
                     maximum supported value is 200 GiB.

              fargateEphemeralStorage -> (structure)
                 The Fargate ephemeral storage settings for the task.

                 sizeInGiB -> (integer)
                     The total amount, in GiB, of the ephemeral storage to set
                     for  the  task. The minimum supported value is 20 GiB and
                     the maximum supported value is 200 GiB.

                 kmsKeyId -> (string)
                     Specify an Key Management Service key ID to  encrypt  the
                     ephemeral storage for the task.

       failures -> (list)
          Any failures associated with the call.

          (structure)
              A  failed resource. For a list of common causes, see API failure
              reasons in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer  Guide
              .

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the failed resource.

              reason -> (string)
                 The reason for the failure.

              detail -> (string)
                 The details of the failure.
