OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The  short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster to
          register your container instance with. If you do not specify a clus-
          ter, the default cluster is assumed.

          (structure)
              An attribute is a name-value pair that's associated with an Ama-
              zon  ECS  object. Attributes enable you to extend the Amazon ECS
              data model by adding custom metadata to your resources. For more
              information, see Attributes in the Amazon Elastic Container Ser-
              vice Developer Guide .

                 with a space.

              targetType -> (string)
                 The type of the target to attach the attribute with. This pa-
                 rameter  is  required  if you use the short form ID for a re-
                 source instead of the full ARN.

              targetId -> (string)
                 The ID of the target. You can specify the short form ID for a
                 resource or the full Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

          supported device type is a GPU.

          (structure)
              The devices that are available on the  container  instance.  The
              only supported device type is a GPU.

              id -> (string)
                 The  ID for the GPUs on the container instance. The available
                 GPU IDs can also be obtained on the container instance in the
                 /var/lib/ecs/gpu/nvidia_gpu_info.json file.

       --tags (list)
          The metadata that you apply to the container instance  to  help  you
          categorize  and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an op-
          tional value. You define both.

          The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

          o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

          o For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each  tag  key
            can have only one value.

          o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

          o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

          o If  your  tagging  schema is used across multiple services and re-
            sources, remember that other services may have restrictions on al-
            lowed  characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, num-
            bers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following charac-
            ters: + - = . _ : / @.

          o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

          o Do  not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination of
            such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is  reserved  for
            Amazon  Web  Services  use.  You cannot edit or delete tag keys or
            values with this prefix.  Tags  with  this  prefix  do  not  count
            against your tags per resource limit.

          (structure)
              The metadata that you apply to a resource to help you categorize
              and organize them. Each tag consists of a key  and  an  optional
              value. You define them.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

              o For  each  resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o If your tagging schema is used across  multiple  services  and
                resources,  remember that other services may have restrictions
                on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are:  let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
                lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.

              o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

              o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination
                of  such  as  a  prefix for either keys or values as it is re-
                served for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or  delete
                tag  keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do
                not count against your tags per resource limit.

              key -> (string)
                 One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key  is  a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              value -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a  tag.  A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       containerInstance -> (structure)
          The container instance that was registered.

          containerInstanceArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  container  instance.  The
              ARN  contains  the arn:aws:ecs namespace, followed by the Region
              of the container instance, the Amazon Web Services account ID of
              the  container instance owner, the container-instance namespace,
              and then the container instance ID. For example, arn:aws:ecs:re-
              gion:aws_account_id:container-instance/container_instance_ID .

          ec2InstanceId -> (string)
              The ID of the container instance. For Amazon EC2 instances, this
              value is the Amazon EC2 instance  ID.  For  external  instances,
              this  value  is  the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager managed
              instance ID.

          capacityProviderName -> (string)
              The capacity provider that's associated with the  container  in-
              stance.

          version -> (long)
              The  version  counter  for  the container instance. Every time a
              container instance experiences a change that triggers  a  Cloud-
              Watch  event,  the  version  counter  is  incremented. If you're
              replicating your Amazon ECS container instance state with Cloud-
              Watch  Events,  you  can  compare the version of a container in-
              stance reported by the Amazon ECS APIs with the version reported
              in  CloudWatch Events for the container instance (inside the de-
              tail object) to verify that the version in your event stream  is
              current.

          versionInfo -> (structure)
              The  version  information for the Amazon ECS container agent and
              Docker daemon running on the container instance.

                 The version number of the Amazon ECS container agent.

              agentHash -> (string)
                 The Git commit hash for the Amazon ECS container agent  build
                 on the amazon-ecs-agent GitHub repository.

              dockerVersion -> (string)
                 The Docker version that's running on the container instance.

          remainingResources -> (list)
              For  CPU and memory resource types, this parameter describes the
              remaining CPU and memory that wasn't already allocated to  tasks
              and  is  therefore  available  for  new tasks. For port resource
              types, this parameter describes the ports that were reserved  by
              the  Amazon  ECS container agent (at instance registration time)
              and any task containers that have reserved port mappings on  the
              host (with the host or bridge network mode). Any port that's not
              specified here is available for new tasks.

              (structure)
                 Describes the resources available for a container instance.

                 name -> (string)

                 longValue -> (long)
                     When the longValue type is set, the value of the resource
                     must be an extended precision floating-point type.

                 integerValue -> (integer)

              amount  of each resource that was available on the container in-
              stance when the container agent registered it with  Amazon  ECS.
              This  value  represents  the total amount of CPU and memory that
              can be allocated on this container instance to tasks.  For  port
              resource types, this parameter describes the ports that were re-
              served by the Amazon ECS container agent when it registered  the
              container instance with Amazon ECS.

              (structure)
                 Describes the resources available for a container instance.

                 name -> (string)
                     The  name of the resource, such as CPU , MEMORY , PORTS ,
                     PORTS_UDP , or a user-defined resource.

                     The type of the resource. Valid values: INTEGER ,  DOUBLE
                     , LONG , or STRINGSET .

                 doubleValue -> (double)
                     When  the  doubleValue  type is set, the value of the re-
                     source must be a double precision floating-point type.

                 longValue -> (long)
                     When the longValue type is set, the value of the resource
                     must be an extended precision floating-point type.

                 integerValue -> (integer)
                     When  the  integerValue type is set, the value of the re-
                     source must be an integer.

                 stringSetValue -> (list)
                     When the stringSetValue type is set, the value of the re-
                     source must be a string type.

                     (string)

          status -> (string)
              The  status of the container instance. The valid values are REG-
              ISTERING , REGISTRATION_FAILED , ACTIVE , INACTIVE , DEREGISTER-
              ING , or DRAINING .

              If  your account has opted in to the awsvpcTrunking account set-
              ting, then any newly registered container instance will  transi-
              tion to a REGISTERING status while the trunk elastic network in-
              terface is provisioned for the  instance.  If  the  registration
              fails,  the  instance  will  transition to a REGISTRATION_FAILED
              status. You can describe the container instance and see the rea-
              son  for  failure  in  the statusReason parameter. Once the con-
              tainer instance is terminated, the  instance  transitions  to  a
              DEREGISTERING  status  while the trunk elastic network interface
              is deprovisioned. The instance then transitions to  an  INACTIVE
              status.

              The  ACTIVE status indicates that the container instance can ac-
              cept tasks. The DRAINING indicates that new tasks aren't  placed
              on  the  container instance and any service tasks running on the
              container instance are removed if possible.  For  more  informa-
              tion, see Container Instance Draining in the Amazon Elastic Con-
              tainer Service Developer Guide .

          statusReason -> (string)
              The reason that the container instance reached its current  sta-
              tus.

          agentConnected -> (boolean)
              This  parameter returns true if the agent is connected to Amazon
              ECS. Registered instances with an agent that may be unhealthy or
              stopped  return false . Only instances connected to an agent can
              accept placement requests.

          runningTasksCount -> (integer)
              The number of tasks on the container instance that  are  in  the
              RUNNING status.

          pendingTasksCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of  tasks on the container instance that are in the
              PENDING status.

          agentUpdateStatus -> (string)
              The status of the most recent agent update. If an update  wasn't
              ever requested, this value is NULL .

          attributes -> (list)
              The  attributes  set  for  the container instance, either by the
              Amazon ECS container agent at instance registration or  manually
              with the  PutAttributes operation.

              (structure)
                 An  attribute  is a name-value pair that's associated with an
                 Amazon ECS object. Attributes enable you to extend the Amazon
                 ECS  data  model by adding custom metadata to your resources.
                 For more information, see Attributes in  the  Amazon  Elastic
                 Container Service Developer Guide .

                 name -> (string)

                     1 and 128 characters. The name may contain  letters  (up-
                     percase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens (-), underscores
                     (_), forward slashes (/), back  slashes  (),  or  periods

                     percase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens (-), underscores
                     (_), periods (.), at signs (@), forward slashes (/), back
                     slashes  (), colons (:), or spaces. The value can't can't
                     start or end with a space.

                 targetType -> (string)
                     The type of the target to attach the attribute with. This
                     parameter  is required if you use the short form ID for a
                     resource instead of the full ARN.

                 targetId -> (string)
                     The ID of the target. You can specify the short  form  ID
                     for a resource or the full Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

          registeredAt -> (timestamp)
              The  Unix timestamp for the time when the container instance was
              registered.

          attachments -> (list)
              The resources attached to a container instance, such as  elastic
              network interfaces.

              (structure)
                 An  object  representing a container instance or task attach-
                 ment.

                 id -> (string)
                     The unique identifier for the attachment.

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of the attachment, such as  ElasticNetworkInter-
                     face .

                 status -> (string)

                     Details  of  the  attachment.  For elastic network inter-
                     faces, this includes the network interface  ID,  the  MAC
                     address, the subnet ID, and the private IPv4 address.

                     (structure)

          tags -> (list)
              The  metadata  that  you apply to the container instance to help
              you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and
              an optional value. You define both.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

              o For  each  resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o If your tagging schema is used across  multiple  services  and
                resources,  remember that other services may have restrictions
                on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are:  let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
                lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.

              o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

              o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination
                of  such  as  a  prefix for either keys or values as it is re-
                served for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or  delete
                tag  keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do
                not count against your tags per resource limit.

              (structure)
                 The metadata that you apply to a resource to help you catego-
                 rize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an op-
                 tional value. You define them.

                 The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                 o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                 o For each resource, each tag key must be  unique,  and  each
                   tag key can have only one value.

                 o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
                   resources, remember that other services may  have  restric-
                   tions  on  allowed characters. Generally allowed characters
                   are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable  in  UTF-8,
                   and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.

                 o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combina-
                   tion of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is

                   delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with  this
                   prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.

                 key -> (string)
                     One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is
                     a general label that acts like a category for  more  spe-
                     cific tag values.

                 value -> (string)
                     The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a tag.
                     A value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

          healthStatus -> (structure)

                 An array of objects representing the details of the container
                 instance health status.

                 (structure)
                     An object representing the result of a container instance
                     health status check.

                     type -> (string)
                        The type of container instance health status that  was
                        verified.

                     status -> (string)
                        The container instance health status.

                     lastUpdated -> (timestamp)
                        The  Unix  timestamp  for  when the container instance
                        health status was last updated.

                     lastStatusChange -> (timestamp)
                        The Unix timestamp for  when  the  container  instance
                        health status last changed.
