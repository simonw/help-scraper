STOP-TASK()                                                        STOP-TASK()



NAME
       stop-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops  a  running  task.  Any  tags  associated  with  the task will be
       deleted.

       When you call StopTask on a task, the equivalent of docker stop is  is-
       sued  to  the containers running in the task. This results in a SIGTERM
       value and a default 30-second timeout, after which the SIGKILL value is
       sent  and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the container handles
       the SIGTERM value gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from receiving
       it, no SIGKILL value is sent.

       For Windows containers, POSIX signals do not work and runtime stops the
       container by sending a CTRL_SHUTDOWN_EVENT . For more information,  see
       Unable  to  react to graceful shutdown of (Windows) container #25982 on
       GitHub.

       NOTE:
          The default 30-second timeout can be configured on  the  Amazon  ECS
          container  agent  with  the ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT variable. For
          more information, see Amazon ECS Container  Agent  Configuration  in
          the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The  short  name  or  full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster
          that hosts the task to stop. If you do not specify  a  cluster,  the
          default cluster is assumed.

       --task (string)
          The task ID of the task to stop.

       --reason (string)
          An  optional  message specified when a task is stopped. For example,
          if you're using a custom scheduler, you can use  this  parameter  to
          specify  the  reason for stopping the task here, and the message ap-
          pears in subsequent DescribeTasks > API operations on this task.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                            tainerPortRange :

                            o You  must  use either the bridge network mode or
                              the awsvpc network mode.

                            o This parameter is available for both the EC2 and
                              Fargate launch types.

                            o This  parameter  is available for both the Linux
                              and Windows operating systems.

                            o The container instance must have at  least  ver-
                              sion  1.67.0 of the container agent and at least
                              version 1.67.0-1 of the ecs-init package

                            o You can specify a maximum of 100 port ranges per
                              container.

                            o You  do  not specify a hostPortRange . The value
                              of the hostPortRange is set as follows:

                              o For containers in a task with the awsvpc  net-
                                work  mode,  the  hostPortRange  is set to the
                                same value as the containerPortRange . This is
                                a static mapping strategy.

                              o For  containers in a task with the bridge net-
                                work mode, the Amazon  ECS  agent  finds  open
                                host  ports  from  the default ephemeral range
                                and passes it to docker to bind  them  to  the
                                container ports.

                            o The  containerPortRange valid values are between
                              1 and 65535.

                            o A port can only be included in one port  mapping
                              per container.

                            o The  first  port  in the range must be less than
                              last port in the range.

          healthStatus -> (string)
              The health status for the task. It's determined by the health of
              the  essential containers in the task. If all essential contain-
              ers in the task are reporting as HEALTHY , the task status  also
              reports as HEALTHY . If any essential containers in the task are
              reporting as UNHEALTHY or UNKNOWN , the task status also reports
              as UNHEALTHY or UNKNOWN .

              NOTE:
                 The  Amazon  ECS container agent doesn't monitor or report on
                 Docker health checks that are embedded in a  container  image
                 and  not  specified in the container definition. For example,
                 this includes those specified in a parent image or  from  the
                 image's  Dockerfile.  Health check parameters that are speci-
                 fied in a container definition  override  any  Docker  health
                 checks that are found in the container image.

          memory -> (string)
              The amount of memory (in MiB) that the task uses as expressed in
              a task definition. It can be expressed as an integer  using  MiB
              (for  example,  1024  ).  If it's expressed as a string using GB
              (for example, 1GB or 1 GB ), it's converted to an integer  indi-
              cating the MiB when the task definition is registered.

                 (structure)
                     The overrides that are sent to a container. An empty con-
                     tainer override can be passed in. An example of an  empty
                     container override is {"containerOverrides": [ ] } . If a
                     non-empty container override is specified, the  name  pa-
                     rameter must be included.

                     You  can  use Secrets Manager or Amazon Web Services Sys-
                     tems Manager Parameter Store to store the sensitive data.

                        You can add new environment variables, which are added
                        to the container at launch, or you  can  override  the
                        existing  environment  variables from the Docker image
                        or the task definition. You must also specify  a  con-

                        to pass to a container, instead of the value from  the
                        container definition.

                        (structure)
                            A  list  of files containing the environment vari-
                            ables to pass to a container. You can  specify  up
                            to  ten  environment  files.  The file must have a
                            .env file extension. Each line in  an  environment
                            file  should  contain  an  environment variable in
                            VARIABLE=VALUE format. Lines beginning with #  are
                            treated as comments and are ignored.

                            If there are environment variables specified using
                            the environment parameter in a  container  defini-
                            tion, they take precedence over the variables con-
                            tained within an environment file. If multiple en-
                            vironment  files  are  specified  that contain the
                            same variable,  they're  processed  from  the  top
                            down.  We  recommend  that you use unique variable
                            names. For more information, see  Use  a  file  to
                            pass  environment  variables to a container in the
                            Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                            Environment variable files are objects  in  Amazon
                            S3  and  all Amazon S3 security considerations ap-
                            ply.

                            You must use the following platforms for the  Far-
                            gate launch type:

                            o Linux platform version 1.4.0 or later.

                            o Windows platform version 1.0.0 or later.

                            Consider  the  following  when  using  the Fargate
                            launch type:

                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role that containers in
                 this task can assume. All containers in this task are granted
                 the permissions that are specified in this role. For more in-
                 formation, see IAM Role for Tasks in the Amazon Elastic  Con-

          platformVersion -> (string)
              The platform version where your task runs on. A platform version
              is only specified for tasks that use the Fargate launch type. If
              you didn't specify one, the LATEST platform version is used. For
              more  information,  see  Fargate Platform Versions in the Amazon
              Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

          platformFamily -> (string)
              The operating system that your tasks are running on. A  platform
              family  is  specified only for tasks that use the Fargate launch
              type.

              All tasks that run as part of this service  must  use  the  same
              platformFamily value as the service (for example, LINUX. ).

          pullStartedAt -> (timestamp)
              The  Unix  timestamp  for the time when the container image pull
              began.

          pullStoppedAt -> (timestamp)
              The Unix timestamp for the time when the  container  image  pull
              completed.

          startedAt -> (timestamp)
              The  Unix  timestamp  for  the  time when the task started. More
              specifically, it's for the time when the task transitioned  from
              the PENDING state to the RUNNING state.

          startedBy -> (string)
              The  tag specified when a task is started. If an Amazon ECS ser-
              vice started the task, the startedBy parameter contains the  de-
              ployment ID of that service.

          stopCode -> (string)
              The stop code indicating why a task was stopped. The stoppedRea-
              son might contain additional details.

              For more information about stop code, see  Stopped  tasks  error
              codes in the Amazon ECS Developer Guide .

          stoppedAt -> (timestamp)
              The  Unix timestamp for the time when the task was stopped. More
              specifically, it's for the time when the task transitioned  from
              the RUNNING state to the STOPPED state.

          stoppedReason -> (string)
              The reason that the task was stopped.

          stoppingAt -> (timestamp)

              specifically, it's for the time when the task  transitions  from
              the RUNNING state to STOPPING .

          tags -> (list)
              The  metadata  that you apply to the task to help you categorize
              and organize the task. Each tag consists of a  key  and  an  op-
              tional value. You define both the key and value.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

              o For  each  resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o If your tagging schema is used across  multiple  services  and
                resources,  remember that other services may have restrictions
                on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are:  let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
                lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.

              o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

              o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination
                of  such  as  a  prefix for either keys or values as it is re-
                served for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or  delete
                tag  keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do
                not count against your tags per resource limit.

              (structure)
                 The metadata that you apply to a resource to help you catego-
                 rize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an op-
                 tional value. You define them.

                 The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                 o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                 o For each resource, each tag key must be  unique,  and  each
                   tag key can have only one value.

                 o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
                   resources, remember that other services may  have  restric-
                   tions  on  allowed characters. Generally allowed characters
                   are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable  in  UTF-8,
                   and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.

                 o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                 o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combina-
                   tion of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is
                   reserved  for  Amazon  Web Services use. You cannot edit or
                   delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with  this
                   prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.

                 key -> (string)
                     One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is
                     a general label that acts like a category for  more  spe-
                     cific tag values.

                 value -> (string)
                     The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a tag.
                     A value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

          taskArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task.

          taskDefinitionArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the task definition that creates the task.

          version -> (long)
              The version counter for the task. Every time a task  experiences
              a  change that starts a CloudWatch event, the version counter is
              incremented. If you replicate your Amazon ECS  task  state  with
              CloudWatch  Events,  you  can  compare the version of a task re-
              ported by the Amazon ECS API actions with the  version  reported
              in  CloudWatch Events for the task (inside the detail object) to
              verify that the version in your event stream is current.

          ephemeralStorage -> (structure)
              The ephemeral storage settings for the task.

              sizeInGiB -> (integer)
                 The total amount, in GiB, of ephemeral storage to set for the
                 task.  The  minimum supported value is 20 GiB and the maximum
                 supported value is 200 GiB.

          fargateEphemeralStorage -> (structure)
              The Fargate ephemeral storage settings for the task.

              sizeInGiB -> (integer)
                 The total amount, in GiB, of the ephemeral storage to set for
                 the task. The minimum supported value is 20 GiB and the maxi-
                 mum supported value is 200 GiB.

              kmsKeyId -> (string)
                 Specify an Key Management  Service  key  ID  to  encrypt  the
                 ephemeral storage for the task.
