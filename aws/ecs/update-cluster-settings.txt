NAME
       update-cluster-settings -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies the settings to use for a cluster.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-cluster-settings
          --cluster <value>
          --settings <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The name of the cluster to modify the settings for.

       --settings (list)
          The  setting to use by default for a cluster. This parameter is used
          to enable CloudWatch Container Insights for a cluster. If this value
          is  specified,  it  overrides  the  containerInsights value set with
          PutAccountSetting or  PutAccountSettingDefault .

          (structure)
              The settings to use when creating a cluster. This  parameter  is
              used to enable CloudWatch Container Insights for a cluster.

              name -> (string)
                 The  name of the cluster setting. The only supported value is
                 containerInsights .

              value -> (string)
                 The value to set for the cluster setting. The supported  val-
                 ues  are  enabled  and  disabled  .  If enabled is specified,
                 CloudWatch Container Insights will be enabled for  the  clus-
                 ter,  otherwise  it  will be disabled unless the containerIn-
                 sights account setting is enabled.  If  a  cluster  value  is
                 specified,  it  will override the containerInsights value set
                 with  PutAccountSetting or  PutAccountSettingDefault .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "containerInsights",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              of the cluster, the Amazon Web Services account ID of the  clus-
              ter owner, the cluster namespace, and then the cluster name. For
              example, arn:aws:ecs:region:012345678910:cluster/test .

          clusterName -> (string)
              A user-generated string that you use to identify your cluster.

          configuration -> (structure)
              The execute command configuration for the cluster.

              executeCommandConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The details of the execute command configuration.

                 kmsKeyId -> (string)

                     data between the local client and the container.

                 logging -> (string)
                     The log setting to use for redirecting logs for your exe-
                     cute command results.  The  following  log  settings  are
                     available.

                     o NONE : The execute command session is not logged.

                     o DEFAULT : The awslogs configuration in the task defini-
                       tion is used. If no logging parameter is specified,  it
                       defaults  to  this  value.  If no awslogs log driver is
                       configured in the task definition, the output won't  be
                       logged.

                     o OVERRIDE  :  Specify  the  logging details as a part of
                       logConfiguration . If the OVERRIDE  logging  option  is
                       specified, the logConfiguration is required.

                 logConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The log configuration for the results of the execute com-
                     mand actions. The logs can be sent to CloudWatch Logs  or
                     an  Amazon S3 bucket. When logging=OVERRIDE is specified,
                     a logConfiguration must be provided.

                     cloudWatchLogGroupName -> (string)
                        The name of the CloudWatch log group to send logs to.

                        NOTE:
                            The CloudWatch log group must already be created.

                     cloudWatchEncryptionEnabled -> (boolean)
                        Determines whether to enable encryption on the  Cloud-
                        Watch  logs. If not specified, encryption will be dis-
                        abled.

                     s3BucketName -> (string)
                        The name of the S3 bucket to send logs to.

                        NOTE:
                            The S3 bucket must already be created.

                     s3EncryptionEnabled -> (boolean)
                        Determines whether to use encryption on the  S3  logs.
                        If not specified, encryption is not used.

                     s3KeyPrefix -> (string)
                        An optional folder in the S3 bucket to place logs in.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the cluster. The following are the possible states
              that are returned.
                 ACTIVE

              The cluster is ready to accept tasks and if applicable  you  can
              register container instances with the cluster.
                 PROVISIONING

              The  cluster  has capacity providers that are associated with it
              and the resources needed for the  capacity  provider  are  being
              created.
                 DEPROVISIONING

              The  cluster  has capacity providers that are associated with it
              and the resources needed for the  capacity  provider  are  being
              deleted.
                 FAILED

              The  cluster  has capacity providers that are associated with it
              and the resources needed for the capacity provider  have  failed
              to create.
                 INACTIVE

              The  cluster  has been deleted. Clusters with an INACTIVE status
              may remain discoverable in your account for a  period  of  time.
              However,  this  behavior  is subject to change in the future. We
              don't recommend that you rely on INACTIVE clusters persisting.

          registeredContainerInstancesCount -> (integer)
              The number of container instances registered into  the  cluster.
              This  includes  container  instances in both ACTIVE and DRAINING
              status.

          runningTasksCount -> (integer)
              The number of tasks in the  cluster  that  are  in  the  RUNNING
              state.

          pendingTasksCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of  tasks  in  the  cluster that are in the PENDING
              state.

          activeServicesCount -> (integer)
              The number of services that are running on the cluster in an AC-
              TIVE state. You can view these services with  ListServices .

          statistics -> (list)
              Additional information about your clusters that are separated by
              launch type. They include the following:

              o runningEC2TasksCount

              o RunningFargateTasksCount

              o pendingEC2TasksCount

              o pendingFargateTasksCount

              o activeEC2ServiceCount

              o activeFargateServiceCount

              o drainingEC2ServiceCount

              o drainingFargateServiceCount

              (structure)
                 A key-value pair object.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the key-value  pair.  For  environment  vari-
                     ables, this is the name of the environment variable.

                 value -> (string)
                     The  value  of  the key-value pair. For environment vari-
                     ables, this is the value of the environment variable.

          tags -> (list)
              The metadata that you apply to the cluster to help  you  catego-
              rize  and  organize  them. Each tag consists of a key and an op-
              tional value. You define both.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

              o For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and  each  tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o If  your  tagging  schema is used across multiple services and
                resources, remember that other services may have  restrictions
                on  allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
                lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.

              o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

              o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination
                of such as a prefix for either keys or values  as  it  is  re-
                served  for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete
                tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix  do
                not count against your tags per resource limit.

              (structure)
                 The metadata that you apply to a resource to help you catego-
                 rize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an op-
                 tional value. You define them.

                 The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                 o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                 o For  each  resource,  each tag key must be unique, and each
                   tag key can have only one value.

                 o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
                   resources,  remember  that other services may have restric-
                   tions on allowed characters. Generally  allowed  characters
                   are:  letters,  numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8,
                   and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.

                 o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                 o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combina-
                   tion of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is
                   reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You  cannot  edit  or
                   delete  tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this
                   prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.

                 key -> (string)
                     One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is
                     a  general  label that acts like a category for more spe-
                     cific tag values.

                 value -> (string)
                     The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a tag.
                     A value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

          settings -> (list)
              The  settings  for the cluster. This parameter indicates whether
              CloudWatch Container Insights is enabled or disabled for a clus-
              ter.

              (structure)
                 The  settings  to use when creating a cluster. This parameter
                 is used to enable CloudWatch Container Insights for  a  clus-
                 ter.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the cluster setting. The only supported value
                     is containerInsights .

                 value -> (string)
                     The value to set for the cluster setting.  The  supported
                     values  are  enabled  and disabled . If enabled is speci-
                     fied, CloudWatch Container Insights will be  enabled  for
                     the  cluster,  otherwise  it  will be disabled unless the
                     containerInsights account setting is enabled. If a  clus-
                     ter value is specified, it will override the containerIn-
                     sights  value  set  with   PutAccountSetting  or   PutAc-
                     countSettingDefault .

          capacityProviders -> (list)
              The capacity providers associated with the cluster.

              (string)

          defaultCapacityProviderStrategy -> (list)
              The  default  capacity  provider  strategy for the cluster. When
              services or tasks are run in the cluster with no launch type  or
              capacity  provider  strategy  specified,  the  default  capacity
              provider strategy is used.

              (structure)
                 The details of  a  capacity  provider  strategy.  A  capacity
                 provider strategy can be set when using the  RunTask or  Cre-
                 ateCluster APIs or as the default capacity provider  strategy
                 for a cluster with the  CreateCluster API.

                 Only  capacity  providers  that are already associated with a
                 cluster and have an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used  in
                 a   capacity   provider   strategy.   The   PutClusterCapaci-
                 tyProviders API is used to associate a capacity provider with
                 a cluster.

                 If  specifying  a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling
                 group, the capacity provider must  already  be  created.  New
                 Auto Scaling group capacity providers can be created with the
                 CreateCapacityProvider API operation.

                 To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either  the  FAR-
                 GATE or FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers. The Fargate capacity
                 providers are available to all accounts and only need  to  be
                 associated  with  a cluster to be used in a capacity provider
                 strategy.

                 A capacity provider strategy may contain a maximum of  6  ca-
                 pacity providers.

                 capacityProvider -> (string)
                     The short name of the capacity provider.

                 weight -> (integer)
                     The  weight  value  designates the relative percentage of
                     the total number of tasks launched that  should  use  the
                     specified  capacity  provider.  The weight value is taken
                     into consideration after the base value, if  defined,  is
                     satisfied.

                     If  no  weight value is specified, the default value of 0
                     is used. When multiple capacity providers  are  specified
                     within  a capacity provider strategy, at least one of the
                     capacity providers must have a weight value greater  than
                     zero  and any capacity providers with a weight of 0 can't
                     be used to place tasks. If you specify multiple  capacity
                     providers in a strategy that all have a weight of 0 , any
                     RunTask  or  CreateService  actions  using  the  capacity
                     provider strategy will fail.

                     An  example  scenario  for  using  weights  is defining a
                     strategy that contains two capacity  providers  and  both
                     have a weight of 1 , then when the base is satisfied, the
                     tasks will  be  split  evenly  across  the  two  capacity
                     providers. Using that same logic, if you specify a weight
                     of 1 for capacityProviderA and a weight of 4 for  capaci-
                     tyProviderB  ,  then  for every one task that's run using
                     capacityProviderA  ,  four  tasks   would   use   capaci-
                     tyProviderB .

                 base -> (integer)
                     The  base  value designates how many tasks, at a minimum,
                     to run on the specified capacity provider. Only  one  ca-
                     pacity  provider in a capacity provider strategy can have
                     a base defined. If no value  is  specified,  the  default
                     value of 0 is used.

          attachments -> (list)
              The  resources  attached  to  a  cluster.  When using a capacity
              provider with a cluster, the Auto Scaling plan that's created is
              returned as a cluster attachment.

              (structure)
                 An  object  representing a container instance or task attach-
                 ment.

                 id -> (string)
                     The unique identifier for the attachment.

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of the attachment, such as  ElasticNetworkInter-
                     face .

                 status -> (string)
                     The status of the attachment. Valid values are PRECREATED
                     , CREATED , ATTACHING , ATTACHED , DETACHING , DETACHED ,
                     DELETED , and FAILED .

                 details -> (list)
                     Details  of  the  attachment.  For elastic network inter-
                     faces, this includes the network interface  ID,  the  MAC
                     address, the subnet ID, and the private IPv4 address.

                     (structure)
                        A key-value pair object.

                        name -> (string)
                            The  name  of  the key-value pair. For environment
                            variables, this is the  name  of  the  environment
                            variable.

                        value -> (string)
                            The  value  of the key-value pair. For environment
                            variables, this is the value  of  the  environment
                            variable.

          attachmentsStatus -> (string)
              The  status  of the capacity providers associated with the clus-
              ter. The following are the states that are returned.
                 UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS

              The available capacity providers for the cluster  are  updating.
              This occurs when the Auto Scaling plan is provisioning or depro-
              visioning.
                 UPDATE_COMPLETE

              The capacity providers have successfully updated.
                 UPDATE_FAILED

              The capacity provider updates failed.
