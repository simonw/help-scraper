OPTIONS
       --capacity-providers (list)
          The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of one or more ca-
          pacity providers. Up to 100 capacity providers can be  described  in
          an action.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --include (list)
          Specifies  whether  or not you want to see the resource tags for the
          capacity provider. If TAGS is specified, the tags  are  included  in
          the  response. If this field is omitted, tags aren't included in the
          response.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            TAGS

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number  of  account  setting  results  returned  by  De-
          scribeCapacityProviders  in paginated output. When this parameter is
          used, DescribeCapacityProviders only returns maxResults results in a
          single  page  along with a nextToken response element. The remaining
          results of the initial request can be seen by  sending  another  De-
          scribeCapacityProviders  request  with the returned nextToken value.
          This value can be between 1 and 10. If this parameter is  not  used,
          then  DescribeCapacityProviders returns up to 10 results and a next-
          Token value if applicable.

       --next-token (string)
          The nextToken value returned from a previous  paginated  DescribeCa-
          pacityProviders  request  where  maxResults was used and the results
          exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from  the
          end of the previous results that returned the nextToken value.

          NOTE:
              This  token  should  be  treated as an opaque identifier that is
              only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other
              programmatic purposes.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       capacityProviders -> (list)
          The list of capacity providers.

          (structure)
              The details for a capacity provider.

              capacityProviderArn -> (string)

              status -> (string)
                 The  current  status  of the capacity provider. Only capacity
                 providers in an ACTIVE state can be used in a cluster. When a
                 capacity provider is successfully deleted, it has an INACTIVE
                 status.

              autoScalingGroupProvider -> (structure)
                 The Auto Scaling group settings for the capacity provider.

                 autoScalingGroupArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies  the  Auto
                     Scaling group.

                 managedScaling -> (structure)
                     The  managed  scaling settings for the Auto Scaling group
                     capacity provider.

                     status -> (string)
                        Determines whether to use managed scaling for the  ca-
                        pacity provider.

                     targetCapacity -> (integer)
                        The  target  capacity value for the capacity provider.
                        The specified value must be greater than  0  and  less
                        than  or  equal to 100 . A value of 100 results in the
                        Amazon EC2 instances in your Auto Scaling group  being
                        completely used.

                     minimumScalingStepSize -> (integer)
                        The  minimum number of container instances that Amazon
                        ECS scales in or scales out at one time. If  this  pa-
                        rameter is omitted, the default value of 1 is used.

                        The  maximum number of container instances that Amazon
                        ECS scales in or scales out at one time. If  this  pa-
                        rameter  is  omitted,  the  default  value of 10000 is
                        used.

                     instanceWarmupPeriod -> (integer)
                        The period of time, in seconds, after a newly launched
                        Amazon  EC2 instance can contribute to CloudWatch met-
                        rics for Auto Scaling  group.  If  this  parameter  is
                        omitted, the default value of 300 seconds is used.

                 managedTerminationProtection -> (string)
                     The managed termination protection setting to use for the
                     Auto Scaling group  capacity  provider.  This  determines
                     whether  the  Auto  Scaling group has managed termination
                     protection. The default is disabled.

                     WARNING:
                        When using  managed  termination  protection,  managed
                        scaling  must  also be used otherwise managed termina-
                        tion protection doesn't work.

                     When managed termination protection  is  enabled,  Amazon
                     ECS  prevents the Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling
                     group that contain tasks from being terminated  during  a
                     scale-in action. The Auto Scaling group and each instance
                     in the Auto Scaling group must have  instance  protection
                     from  scale-in actions enabled as well. For more informa-
                     tion, see Instance Protection in the  Auto  Scaling  User
                     Guide .

                     When  managed  termination  protection  is disabled, your
                     Amazon EC2 instances aren't  protected  from  termination
                     when the Auto Scaling group scales in.

              updateStatus -> (string)
                 The update status of the capacity provider. The following are
                 the possible states that is returned.
                     DELETE_IN_PROGRESS

                 The capacity provider is in the process of being deleted.
                     DELETE_COMPLETE

                 The capacity provider was successfully deleted and has an IN-
                 ACTIVE status.
                     DELETE_FAILED

                 The  capacity  provider  can't  be deleted. The update status
                 reason provides further details about why the delete failed.

              updateStatusReason -> (string)
                 The update status reason. This provides further details about
                 the update status for the capacity provider.

              tags -> (list)
                 The  metadata that you apply to the capacity provider to help
                 you categorize and organize it. Each tag consists  of  a  key
                 and an optional value. You define both.

                 The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                 o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                 o For  each  resource,  each tag key must be unique, and each
                   tag key can have only one value.

                 o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
                   resources,  remember  that other services may have restric-
                   tions on allowed characters. Generally  allowed  characters
                   are:  letters,  numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8,
                   and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.

                 o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                 o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combina-
                   tion of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is
                   reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You  cannot  edit  or
                   delete  tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this
                   prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.

                 (structure)
                     The metadata that you apply to a  resource  to  help  you
                     categorize  and organize them. Each tag consists of a key
                     and an optional value. You define them.

                       as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You can-
                       not edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix.
                       Tags with this prefix do not count  against  your  tags
                       per resource limit.

                     key -> (string)
                        One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key
                        is a general label that acts like a category for  more
                        specific tag values.

                        The  optional  part of a key-value pair that make up a
                        tag. A value acts as a descriptor within a  tag  cate-
                        gory (key).

          Any failures associated with the call.

          (structure)
              A  failed resource. For a list of common causes, see API failure
              reasons in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer  Guide
              .

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the failed resource.

              reason -> (string)
                 The reason for the failure.

              detail -> (string)
                 The details of the failure.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken value to include in a future DescribeCapacityProviders
          request. When the results of a DescribeCapacityProviders request ex-
          ceed  maxResults  , this value can be used to retrieve the next page
          of results. This value is null when there are no more results to re-
          turn.
