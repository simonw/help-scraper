OPTIONS
       --clusters (list)
          A  list  of  up to 100 cluster names or full cluster Amazon Resource
          Name (ARN) entries. If you do not specify  a  cluster,  the  default
          cluster is assumed.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --include (list)
          Determines whether to include additional information about the clus-
          ters in the response. If this field  is  omitted,  this  information
          isn't included.

          If  ATTACHMENTS  is specified, the attachments for the container in-
          stances or tasks within the cluster are included.

          If SETTINGS is specified, the settings for the cluster are included.

          If CONFIGURATIONS is specified, the configuration for the cluster is
          included.

          If  STATISTICS is specified, the task and service count is included,
          separated by launch type.

          If TAGS is specified, the metadata tags associated with the  cluster
          are included.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            ATTACHMENTS
            CONFIGURATIONS
            SETTINGS
            STATISTICS
            TAGS

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To describe a cluster

       The  following  describe-clusters  example  retrieves details about the
       specified cluster.

          aws ecs describe-clusters \
              --cluster default

       Output:

          {
              "clusters": [
                  {
                      "status": "ACTIVE",
                      "clusterName": "default",
                      "registeredContainerInstancesCount": 0,
                      "pendingTasksCount": 0,
                      "runningTasksCount": 0,
                      "activeServicesCount": 1,
                      "clusterArn": "arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster/default"
                  }
              ],
              "failures": []
          }

       oper Guide.

       Example 2: To describe a cluster with the attachment option

       The  following  describe-clusters example specifies the ATTACHMENTS op-
       tion. It retrieves details about the specified cluster and  a  list  of
       resources  attached to the cluster in the form of attachments. When us-
       ing a capacity provider with a cluster, the resources, either AutoScal-
       ing  plans or scaling policies, will be represented as asp or as_policy
       ATTACHMENTS.

          aws ecs describe-clusters \
              --include ATTACHMENTS \
              --clusters sampleCluster

       Output:

       oper Guide.

OUTPUT
       clusters -> (list)
          The list of clusters.

          (structure)
              A regional grouping of one or more container instances where you
              can run task requests. Each account receives a  default  cluster
              the  first time you use the Amazon ECS service, but you may also
              create other clusters. Clusters may contain more  than  one  in-
              stance type simultaneously.

              clusterArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the cluster.
                 For more information about the ARN  format,  see  Amazon  Re-
                 source Name (ARN) in the Amazon ECS Developer Guide .

              clusterName -> (string)
                 A  user-generated  string that you use to identify your clus-
                 ter.

              configuration -> (structure)
                 The execute command configuration for the cluster.

                 executeCommandConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The details of the execute command configuration.

                     kmsKeyId -> (string)
                        Specify an Key Management Service key  ID  to  encrypt
                        the data between the local client and the container.

                     logging -> (string)
                        The  log  setting to use for redirecting logs for your
                        execute command results. The  following  log  settings
                        are available.

                        o NONE : The execute command session is not logged.

                        o DEFAULT : The awslogs configuration in the task def-
                          inition is used. If no logging parameter  is  speci-
                          fied,  it  defaults to this value. If no awslogs log
                          driver is configured in  the  task  definition,  the
                          output won't be logged.

                        o OVERRIDE  : Specify the logging details as a part of
                          logConfiguration . If the OVERRIDE logging option is
                          specified, the logConfiguration is required.

                     logConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The  log  configuration for the results of the execute
                        command actions. The logs can be  sent  to  CloudWatch
                        Logs  or an Amazon S3 bucket. When logging=OVERRIDE is
                        specified, a logConfiguration must be provided.

                        cloudWatchLogGroupName -> (string)
                            The name of the CloudWatch log group to send  logs

                            NOTE:
                               The  CloudWatch  log group must already be cre-
                               ated.

                        cloudWatchEncryptionEnabled -> (boolean)
                            Determines whether to use encryption on the Cloud-
                            Watch  logs.  If not specified, encryption will be
                            disabled.

                        s3BucketName -> (string)

                            NOTE:
                               The S3 bucket must already be created.

                        s3EncryptionEnabled -> (boolean)
                            Determines whether to use  encryption  on  the  S3

                            An  optional folder in the S3 bucket to place logs
                            in.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the cluster. The  following  are  the  possible
                 states that are returned.
                     ACTIVE

                 The  cluster  is  ready to accept tasks and if applicable you
                 can register container instances with the cluster.
                     PROVISIONING

                 The cluster has capacity providers that are  associated  with
                 it and the resources needed for the capacity provider are be-
                 ing created.
                     DEPROVISIONING

                 The cluster has capacity providers that are  associated  with
                 it and the resources needed for the capacity provider are be-
                 ing deleted.
                     FAILED

                 The cluster has capacity providers that are  associated  with
                 it  and  the  resources needed for the capacity provider have
                 failed to create.
                     INACTIVE

                 The cluster has been deleted. Clusters with an INACTIVE  sta-
                 tus  may  remain discoverable in your account for a period of
                 time. However, this behavior is subject to change in the  fu-
                 ture.  We  don't recommend that you rely on INACTIVE clusters
                 persisting.

              registeredContainerInstancesCount -> (integer)
                 The number of container instances registered into  the  clus-
                 ter.  This  includes  container  instances in both ACTIVE and
                 DRAINING status.

              runningTasksCount -> (integer)
                 The number of tasks in the cluster that are  in  the  RUNNING
                 state.

              pendingTasksCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  tasks in the cluster that are in the PENDING
                 state.

              activeServicesCount -> (integer)
                 The number of services that are running on the cluster in  an
                 ACTIVE  state. You can view these services with  ListServices
                 .

              statistics -> (list)
                 Additional information about your clusters that are separated
                 by launch type. They include the following:

                 o runningEC2TasksCount

                 o RunningFargateTasksCount

                 o pendingEC2TasksCount

                 o pendingFargateTasksCount

                 o activeEC2ServiceCount

                 o activeFargateServiceCount

                 o drainingEC2ServiceCount

                 o drainingFargateServiceCount

                 (structure)
                     A key-value pair object.

                     name -> (string)
                        The  name of the key-value pair. For environment vari-
                        ables, this is the name of the environment variable.

                     value -> (string)
                        The value of the key-value pair. For environment vari-
                        ables, this is the value of the environment variable.

              tags -> (list)
                 The  metadata that you apply to the cluster to help you cate-
                 gorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key  and  an
                 optional value. You define both.

                 The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                 o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                 o For  each  resource,  each tag key must be unique, and each
                   tag key can have only one value.

                 o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
                   resources,  remember  that other services may have restric-
                   tions on allowed characters. Generally  allowed  characters
                   are:  letters,  numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8,
                   and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.

                 o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                 o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combina-
                   tion of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is
                   reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You  cannot  edit  or
                   delete  tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this
                   prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.

                 (structure)
                     The metadata that you apply to a  resource  to  help  you
                     categorize  and organize them. Each tag consists of a key
                     and an optional value. You define them.

                     The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                     o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                     o For each resource, each tag key  must  be  unique,  and
                       each tag key can have only one value.

                     o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                     o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                     o If your tagging schema is used across multiple services
                       and resources, remember that other  services  may  have
                       restrictions  on  allowed characters. Generally allowed
                       characters are: letters,  numbers,  and  spaces  repre-
                       sentable  in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - =
                       . _ : / @.

                     o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                     o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase com-
                       bination  of such as a prefix for either keys or values
                       as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You can-
                       not edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix.
                       Tags with this prefix do not count  against  your  tags
                       per resource limit.

                     key -> (string)
                        One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key
                        is a general label that acts like a category for  more
                        specific tag values.

                     value -> (string)
                        The  optional  part of a key-value pair that make up a
                        tag. A value acts as a descriptor within a  tag  cate-
                        gory (key).

              settings -> (list)
                 The  settings  for  the  cluster.  This  parameter  indicates
                 whether CloudWatch Container Insights is enabled or  disabled
                 for a cluster.

                 (structure)
                     The settings to use when creating a cluster. This parame-
                     ter is used to turn on CloudWatch Container Insights  for
                     a cluster.

                     name -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the cluster setting. The only supported
                        value is containerInsights .

                     value -> (string)
                        The value to set for the  cluster  setting.  The  sup-
                        ported values are enabled and disabled . If enabled is
                        specified, CloudWatch Container Insights will  be  en-
                        abled  for  the cluster, otherwise it will be disabled
                        unless the containerInsights account  setting  is  en-
                        abled.  If a cluster value is specified, it will over-
                        ride the  containerInsights  value  set  with   PutAc-
                        countSetting or  PutAccountSettingDefault .

              capacityProviders -> (list)
                 The capacity providers associated with the cluster.

                 (string)

              defaultCapacityProviderStrategy -> (list)
                 The  default capacity provider strategy for the cluster. When
                 services or tasks are run in the cluster with no launch  type
                 or capacity provider strategy specified, the default capacity
                 provider strategy is used.

                 (structure)
                     The details of a capacity provider strategy.  A  capacity
                     provider  strategy  can be set when using the  RunTask or
                     CreateCluster APIs or as the  default  capacity  provider
                     strategy for a cluster with the  CreateCluster API.

                     Only  capacity providers that are already associated with
                     a cluster and have an ACTIVE or UPDATING  status  can  be
                     used  in a capacity provider strategy. The  PutClusterCa-
                     pacityProviders API  is  used  to  associate  a  capacity
                     provider with a cluster.

                     If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scal-
                     ing group, the capacity provider must already be created.
                     New  Auto Scaling group capacity providers can be created
                     with the  CreateCapacityProvider API operation.

                     To use a Fargate capacity provider,  specify  either  the
                     FARGATE  or  FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers. The Fargate
                     capacity providers are available to all accounts and only
                     need  to be associated with a cluster to be used in a ca-
                     pacity provider strategy.

                     A capacity provider strategy may contain a maximum  of  6
                     capacity providers.

                     capacityProvider -> (string)
                        The short name of the capacity provider.

                     weight -> (integer)
                        The weight value designates the relative percentage of
                        the total number of tasks launched that should use the
                        specified capacity provider. The weight value is taken
                        into consideration after the base value,  if  defined,
                        is satisfied.

                        If  no weight value is specified, the default value of
                        0 is used. When multiple capacity providers are speci-
                        fied within a capacity provider strategy, at least one
                        of the capacity providers must  have  a  weight  value
                        greater  than  zero  and any capacity providers with a
                        weight of 0 can't be used to place tasks. If you spec-
                        ify multiple capacity providers in a strategy that all
                        have a weight of 0 , any RunTask or CreateService  ac-
                        tions using the capacity provider strategy will fail.

                        An  example  scenario  for using weights is defining a
                        strategy that contains two capacity providers and both
                        have  a weight of 1 , then when the base is satisfied,
                        the tasks will be split evenly across the two capacity
                        providers.  Using  that  same  logic, if you specify a
                        weight of 1 for capacityProviderA and a  weight  of  4
                        for capacityProviderB , then for every one task that's
                        run using capacityProviderA , four tasks would use ca-
                        pacityProviderB .

                     base -> (integer)
                        The  base  value designates how many tasks, at a mini-
                        mum, to run on the specified capacity  provider.  Only
                        one  capacity provider in a capacity provider strategy
                        can have a base defined. If no value is specified, the
                        default value of 0 is used.

              attachments -> (list)
                 The  resources  attached  to a cluster. When using a capacity
                 provider with a cluster, the capacity provider and associated
                 resources are returned as cluster attachments.

                 (structure)
                     An  object  representing a container instance or task at-
                     tachment.

                     id -> (string)
                        The unique identifier for the attachment.

                     type -> (string)
                        The type of the attachment, such as  ElasticNetworkIn-
                        terface .

                     status -> (string)
                        The status of the attachment. Valid values are PRECRE-
                        ATED , CREATED , ATTACHING , ATTACHED  ,  DETACHING  ,
                        DETACHED , DELETED , and FAILED .

                     details -> (list)
                        Details  of the attachment. For elastic network inter-
                        faces, this includes the network interface ID, the MAC
                        address, the subnet ID, and the private IPv4 address.

                        (structure)
                            A key-value pair object.

                            name -> (string)
                               The name of the key-value pair. For environment
                               variables, this is the name of the  environment
                               variable.

                            value -> (string)
                               The  value  of the key-value pair. For environ-
                               ment variables, this is the value of the  envi-
                               ronment variable.

              attachmentsStatus -> (string)
                 The  status  of  the  capacity  providers associated with the
                 cluster. The following are the states that are returned.
