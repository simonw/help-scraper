DEPLOY()                                                              DEPLOY()



NAME
       deploy -

DESCRIPTION
       Deploys  a  new task definition to the specified ECS service. Only ser-
       vices that use CodeDeploy for deployments are supported.  This  command
       will register a new task definition, update the CodeDeploy appspec with
       the new task definition revision, create a CodeDeploy  deployment,  and
       wait  for  the  deployment  to successfully complete. This command will
       exit with a return code of 255  if  the  deployment  does  not  succeed
       within 30 minutes by default or up to 10 minutes more than your deploy-
       ment group's configured wait time (max of 6 hours).

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            deploy
          --service <value>
          --task-definition <value>
          --codedeploy-appspec <value>

OPTIONS
       --service (string) The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
       the service to update

       --task-definition  (string)  The  file  path where your task definition
       file is located. The format of the file must be the same  as  the  JSON
       output of:

          aws ecs register-task-definition --generate-cli-skeleton

       --codedeploy-appspec  (string)  The file path where your AWS CodeDeploy
       appspec file is located. The appspec file may be in JSON or  YAML  for-
       mat.  The  TaskDefinition  property  will be updated within the appspec
       with the newly registered task definition ARN, overwriting  any  place-
       holder values in the file.

       --cluster (string) The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
       the cluster that your service is running within. If you do not  specify
       a cluster, the "default" cluster is assumed.

       --codedeploy-application (string) The name of the AWS CodeDeploy appli-
       cation to use for the deployment. The specified  application  must  use
       the  'ECS'  compute platform. If you do not specify an application, the
       application name AppECS-[CLUSTER_NAME]-[SERVICE_NAME] is assumed.

       --codedeploy-deployment-group (string) The name of the  AWS  CodeDeploy
       deployment  group  to  use for the deployment. The specified deployment
       group must be associated with the specified ECS service and cluster. If
       you  do  not  specify a deployment group, the deployment group name Dg-
       pECS-[CLUSTER_NAME]-[SERVICE_NAME] is assumed.
