CREATE-CLUSTER()                                              CREATE-CLUSTER()



NAME
       create-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new Amazon ECS cluster. By default, your account receives a
       default cluster when you launch your first container instance. However,
       you can create your own cluster with a unique name.

       NOTE:
          When  you  call the CreateCluster API operation, Amazon ECS attempts
          to create the Amazon ECS service-linked role for your account.  This
          is so that it can manage required resources in other Amazon Web Ser-
          vices services on your behalf. However, if the user that  makes  the
          call  doesn't have permissions to create the service-linked role, it
          isn't created. For more information, see Using service-linked  roles
          for  Amazon  ECS  in  the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer
          Guide .

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of your cluster. If you don't specify a name for your clus-
          ter,  you  create a cluster that's named default . Up to 255 letters
          (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, underscores, and hyphens are al-
          lowed.

       --tags (list)
          The  metadata  that  you apply to the cluster to help you categorize
          and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value.
          You define both.

          The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

          o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

          o For  each  resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key
            can have only one value.

          o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

          o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

          o If your tagging schema is used across multiple  services  and  re-
            sources, remember that other services may have restrictions on al-
            lowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters,  num-
            bers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following charac-
            ters: + - = . _ : / @.

          o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

          o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination  of
            such  as  a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for
            Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or  delete  tag  keys  or
            values  with  this  prefix.  Tags  with  this  prefix do not count
            against your tags per resource limit.

          (structure)
              The metadata that you apply to a resource to help you categorize
              and  organize  them.  Each tag consists of a key and an optional
              value. You define them.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

              o For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and  each  tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o If  your  tagging  schema is used across multiple services and
                resources, remember that other services may have  restrictions
                on  allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
                lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.

              o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

              o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination
                of such as a prefix for either keys or values  as  it  is  re-
                served  for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete
                tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix  do
                not count against your tags per resource limit.

              key -> (string)
                 One  part  of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              value -> (string)
                 The  optional  part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

            ...
          ]

       --settings (list)
          The setting to use when creating a cluster. This parameter  is  used
          to  turn  on  CloudWatch  Container  Insights for a cluster. If this
          value is specified, it overrides  the  containerInsights  value  set
          with PutAccountSetting or PutAccountSettingDefault .

          (structure)
              The  settings  to use when creating a cluster. This parameter is
              used to turn on CloudWatch Container Insights for a cluster.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the cluster setting. The  value  is  containerIn-
                 sights .

              value -> (string)
                 The  value to set for the cluster setting. The supported val-
                 ues are enabled and disabled .

                 If you set name to containerInsights and value to  enabled  ,
                 CloudWatch  Container  Insights  will  be on for the cluster,
                 otherwise it will be off unless the containerInsights account
                 setting  is  turned  on.  If a cluster value is specified, it
                 will  override   the   containerInsights   value   set   with
                 PutAccountSetting or PutAccountSettingDefault .

            }
            ...
          ]

       --configuration (structure)
          The execute command configuration for the cluster.

          executeCommandConfiguration -> (structure)
              The details of the execute command configuration.

              kmsKeyId -> (string)
                 Specify  an Key Management Service key ID to encrypt the data
                 between the local client and the container.

              logging -> (string)
                 The log setting to use for redirecting logs for your  execute
                 command results. The following log settings are available.

                 o NONE : The execute command session is not logged.

                 o DEFAULT  : The awslogs configuration in the task definition
                   is used. If no logging parameter is specified, it  defaults
                   to  this  value.  If no awslogs log driver is configured in
                   the task definition, the output won't be logged.

                 o OVERRIDE : Specify the logging details as a part of logCon-
                   figuration  .  If the OVERRIDE logging option is specified,
                   the logConfiguration is required.

              logConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The log configuration for the results of the execute  command
                 actions. The logs can be sent to CloudWatch Logs or an Amazon
                 S3 bucket. When logging=OVERRIDE is specified, a  logConfigu-
                 ration must be provided.

                 cloudWatchLogGroupName -> (string)
                     The name of the CloudWatch log group to send logs to.

                     NOTE:
                        The CloudWatch log group must already be created.

                 cloudWatchEncryptionEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Determines  whether  to  use encryption on the CloudWatch
                     logs. If not specified, encryption will be off.

                 s3BucketName -> (string)
                     The name of the S3 bucket to send logs to.

                     NOTE:
                        The S3 bucket must already be created.

                 s3EncryptionEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Determines whether to use encryption on the S3  logs.  If
                     not specified, encryption is not used.

                 s3KeyPrefix -> (string)
                     An optional folder in the S3 bucket to place logs in.

          managedStorageConfiguration -> (structure)
              The details of the managed storage configuration.

              kmsKeyId -> (string)
                 Specify  a  Key Management Service key ID to encrypt the man-
                 aged storage.

              fargateEphemeralStorageKmsKeyId -> (string)
                 Specify the Key Management Service key  ID  for  the  Fargate
                 ephemeral storage.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          executeCommandConfiguration={kmsKeyId=string,logging=string,logConfiguration={cloudWatchLogGroupName=string,cloudWatchEncryptionEnabled=boolean,s3BucketName=string,s3EncryptionEnabled=boolean,s3KeyPrefix=string}},managedStorageConfiguration={kmsKeyId=string,fargateEphemeralStorageKmsKeyId=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "executeCommandConfiguration": {
              "kmsKeyId": "string",
              "logging": "NONE"|"DEFAULT"|"OVERRIDE",
              "logConfiguration": {
                "cloudWatchLogGroupName": "string",
                "cloudWatchEncryptionEnabled": true|false,
                "s3BucketName": "string",

              "kmsKeyId": "string",
              "fargateEphemeralStorageKmsKeyId": "string"
            }
          }

       --capacity-providers (list)
          The  short  name of one or more capacity providers to associate with
          the cluster. A capacity provider must be associated with  a  cluster
          before  it  can be included as part of the default capacity provider
          strategy of the cluster or used in a capacity provider strategy when
          calling the CreateService or RunTask actions.

          If  specifying  a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group,
          the capacity provider must be created but not  associated  with  an-
          other cluster. New Auto Scaling group capacity providers can be cre-
          ated with the CreateCapacityProvider API operation.

          To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either  the  FARGATE  or
          FARGATE_SPOT  capacity providers. The Fargate capacity providers are
          available to all accounts and only need  to  be  associated  with  a
          cluster to be used.

          The  PutCapacityProvider API operation is used to update the list of
          available capacity providers for a cluster after the cluster is cre-
          ated.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --default-capacity-provider-strategy (list)
          The  capacity  provider strategy to set as the default for the clus-
          ter. After a default capacity provider strategy is set for  a  clus-
          ter,  when you call the CreateService or RunTask APIs with no capac-
          ity provider strategy or launch type specified, the default capacity
          provider strategy for the cluster is used.

          If  a default capacity provider strategy isn't defined for a cluster
          when  it  was  created,  it  can   be   defined   later   with   the
          PutClusterCapacityProviders API operation.

          (structure)
              The details of a capacity provider strategy. A capacity provider
              strategy can be set when using the RunTask or CreateCluster APIs
              or  as the default capacity provider strategy for a cluster with
              the CreateCluster API.

              Only capacity providers that are already associated with a clus-
              ter  and  have an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used in a ca-
              pacity provider strategy. The PutClusterCapacityProviders API is
              used to associate a capacity provider with a cluster.

              If  specifying  a  capacity  provider  that uses an Auto Scaling
              group, the capacity provider must already be created.  New  Auto
              Scaling  group  capacity  providers  can  be  created  with  the
              CreateClusterCapacityProvider API operation.

              To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either  the  FARGATE
              or   FARGATE_SPOT   capacity  providers.  The  Fargate  capacity
              providers are available to all accounts and only need to be  as-
              sociated with a cluster to be used in a capacity provider strat-
              egy.

              With FARGATE_SPOT , you can run interruption tolerant tasks at a
              rate  that's  discounted  compared  to  the  FARGATE price. FAR-
              GATE_SPOT runs tasks on spare compute capacity. When Amazon  Web
              Services  needs  the  capacity  back, your tasks are interrupted
              with a two-minute warning.  FARGATE_SPOT  supports  Linux  tasks
              with the X86_64 architecture on platform version 1.3.0 or later.
              FARGATE_SPOT supports Linux tasks with the ARM64 architecture on
              platform version 1.4.0 or later.

              A capacity provider strategy may contain a maximum of 6 capacity
              providers.

              capacityProvider -> (string)
                 The short name of the capacity provider.

              weight -> (integer)
                 The weight value designates the relative  percentage  of  the
                 total  number of tasks launched that should use the specified
                 capacity provider. The weight value is taken into  considera-
                 tion after the base value, if defined, is satisfied.

                 If  no  weight  value is specified, the default value of 0 is
                 used. When multiple capacity providers are specified within a
                 capacity  provider  strategy,  at  least  one of the capacity
                 providers must have a weight value greater than zero and  any
                 capacity  providers with a weight of 0 can't be used to place
                 tasks. If you specify multiple capacity providers in a strat-
                 egy  that  all have a weight of 0 , any RunTask or CreateSer-
                 vice actions using the capacity provider strategy will fail.

                 An example scenario for using weights is defining a  strategy
                 that  contains  two capacity providers and both have a weight
                 of 1 , then when the base is satisfied,  the  tasks  will  be
                 split  evenly  across  the two capacity providers. Using that
                 same logic,  if  you  specify  a  weight  of  1  for  capaci-
                 tyProviderA  and  a  weight of 4 for capacityProviderB , then
                 for every one task that's run using capacityProviderA ,  four
                 tasks would use capacityProviderB .

              base -> (integer)
                 The  base  value  designates how many tasks, at a minimum, to
                 run on the specified capacity  provider.  Only  one  capacity
                 provider  in a capacity provider strategy can have a base de-
                 fined. If no value is specified, the default value  of  0  is
                 used.

            }
            ...
          ]

       --service-connect-defaults (structure)
          Use this parameter to set a default Service Connect namespace. After
          you set a default Service Connect namespace, any new  services  with
          Service  Connect turned on that are created in the cluster are added
          as client services in the namespace. This setting  only  applies  to
          new  services that set the enabled parameter to true in the Service-
          ConnectConfiguration . You can set the namespace of each service in-
          dividually  in  the ServiceConnectConfiguration to override this de-
          fault parameter.

          Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to ser-
          vices  in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of
          the clusters in the namespace. Tasks connect through a managed proxy
          container  that  collects logs and metrics for increased visibility.
          Only the tasks that Amazon ECS services create  are  supported  with
          Service  Connect.  For  more information, see Service Connect in the
          Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

          namespace -> (string)
              The namespace name or full Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the
              Cloud  Map  namespace  that's used when you create a service and
              don't specify a Service  Connect  configuration.  The  namespace
              name  can include up to 1024 characters. The name is case-sensi-
              tive. The name can't include hyphens  (-),  tilde  (~),  greater
              than (>), less than (<), or slash (/).

              If  you enter an existing namespace name or ARN, then that name-
              space will be used. Any namespace type is supported.  The  name-
              space  must  be in this account and this Amazon Web Services Re-
              gion.

              If you enter a new name, a Cloud Map namespace will be  created.
              Amazon  ECS  creates  a Cloud Map namespace with the "API calls"
              method of  instance  discovery  only.  This  instance  discovery
              method  is  the "HTTP" namespace type in the Command Line Inter-
              face. Other types of instance discovery aren't used  by  Service
              Connect.

              If  you update the cluster with an empty string "" for the name-
              space name, the cluster configuration for Service Connect is re-
              moved. Note that the namespace will remain in Cloud Map and must
              be deleted separately.

              For more information about Cloud Map, see Working with  Services
              in the Cloud Map Developer Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          namespace=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "namespace": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To create a new cluster

       The following create-cluster example creates a cluster.

          aws ecs create-cluster \
              --cluster-name MyCluster

       Output:

          {
              "cluster": {
                  "clusterArn": "arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster/MyCluster",
                  "clusterName": "MyCluster",
                  "status": "ACTIVE",
                  "registeredContainerInstancesCount": 0,
                  "pendingTasksCount": 0,
                  "runningTasksCount": 0,
                  "activeServicesCount": 0,
                  "statistics": [],

       oper Guide.

       Example 2: To create a new cluster using capacity providers

       The  following  create-cluster example creates a cluster and associates
       two existing capacity providers with it.  The  create-capacity-provider
       command is used to create a capacity provider. Specifying a default ca-
       pacity provider strategy is optional, but recommended. In this example,
       we  create  a  cluster  named  MyCluster  and  associate  the MyCapaci-
       tyProvider1 and MyCapacityProvider2 capacity providers with it.  A  de-
       fault  capacity  provider  strategy is specified that spreads the tasks
       evenly across both capacity providers.

          aws ecs create-cluster
                 --cluster-name   MyCluster   --capacity-providers   MyCapaci-
                 tyProvider1        MyCapacityProvider2       --default-capac-
                 ity-provider-strategy              capacityProvider=MyCapaci-
                 tyProvider1,weight=1               capacityProvider=MyCapaci-
                 tyProvider2,weight=1

              The cluster is ready to accept tasks and if applicable  you  can
              register container instances with the cluster.
                 PROVISIONING

              The  cluster  has capacity providers that are associated with it
              and the resources needed for the  capacity  provider  are  being
              created.
                 DEPROVISIONING

              The  cluster  has capacity providers that are associated with it
              and the resources needed for the  capacity  provider  are  being
              deleted.
                 FAILED

              The  cluster  has capacity providers that are associated with it
              and the resources needed for the capacity provider  have  failed
              to create.
                 INACTIVE

              The  cluster  has been deleted. Clusters with an INACTIVE status
              may remain discoverable in your account for a  period  of  time.
              However,  this  behavior  is subject to change in the future. We

              The  number  of  tasks  in  the  cluster that are in the PENDING
              state.

          activeServicesCount -> (integer)
              The number of services that are running on the cluster in an AC-
              TIVE state. You can view these services with PListServices .

          statistics -> (list)
              Additional information about your clusters that are separated by
              launch type. They include the following:

                     The name of the key-value  pair.  For  environment  vari-
                     ables, this is the name of the environment variable.

                 value -> (string)
                     The  value  of  the key-value pair. For environment vari-
                     ables, this is the value of the environment variable.

          tags -> (list)
              The metadata that you apply to the cluster to help  you  catego-
              rize  and  organize  them. Each tag consists of a key and an op-
              tional value. You define both.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

              o For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and  each  tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o If  your  tagging  schema is used across multiple services and
                resources, remember that other services may have  restrictions
                on  allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
                lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.

              o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

              o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination
                of such as a prefix for either keys or values  as  it  is  re-
                served  for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete
                tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix  do
                not count against your tags per resource limit.

              (structure)
                 The metadata that you apply to a resource to help you catego-
                 rize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an op-
                 tional value. You define them.

                 o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
                   resources,  remember  that other services may have restric-
                   tions on allowed characters. Generally  allowed  characters
                   are:  letters,  numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8,
                   and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.

                 o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                 o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combina-
                   tion of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is
                   reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You  cannot  edit  or
                   delete  tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this
                   prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.

                 key -> (string)
                     One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is
                     a  general  label that acts like a category for more spe-
                     cific tag values.

                 value -> (string)
                     The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a tag.
                     A value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

          settings -> (list)
              The  settings  for the cluster. This parameter indicates whether
              CloudWatch Container Insights is on or off for a cluster.

              (structure)
                 The settings to use when creating a cluster.  This  parameter
                 is  used to turn on CloudWatch Container Insights for a clus-
                 ter.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the cluster setting. The value is  container-
                     Insights .

                 value -> (string)
                     The  value  to set for the cluster setting. The supported
                     values are enabled and disabled .

                     If you set name to containerInsights and value to enabled
                     ,  CloudWatch Container Insights will be on for the clus-
                     ter, otherwise it will be  off  unless  the  containerIn-
                     sights  account  setting is turned on. If a cluster value
                     is specified,  it  will  override  the  containerInsights
                     value       set       with      PutAccountSetting      or
                     PutAccountSettingDefault .

          capacityProviders -> (list)
              The capacity providers associated with the cluster.

              (string)

          defaultCapacityProviderStrategy -> (list)
              The default capacity provider strategy  for  the  cluster.  When
              services  or tasks are run in the cluster with no launch type or
              capacity  provider  strategy  specified,  the  default  capacity
              provider strategy is used.

              (structure)
                 The  details  of  a  capacity  provider  strategy. A capacity
                 provider strategy can  be  set  when  using  the  RunTask  or
                 CreateCluster APIs or as the default capacity provider strat-
                 egy for a cluster with the CreateCluster API.

                 Only capacity providers that are already  associated  with  a
                 cluster  and have an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used in
                 a capacity provider strategy. The PutClusterCapacityProviders
                 API is used to associate a capacity provider with a cluster.

                 If  specifying  a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling
                 group, the capacity provider must  already  be  created.  New
                 Auto Scaling group capacity providers can be created with the
                 CreateClusterCapacityProvider API operation.

                 To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either  the  FAR-
                 GATE or FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers. The Fargate capacity
                 providers are available to all accounts and only need  to  be
                 associated  with  a cluster to be used in a capacity provider
                 strategy.

                 With FARGATE_SPOT , you can run interruption  tolerant  tasks
                 at  a  rate  that's discounted compared to the FARGATE price.
                 FARGATE_SPOT runs tasks on spare compute capacity. When  Ama-
                 zon  Web Services needs the capacity back, your tasks are in-
                 terrupted with a two-minute  warning.  FARGATE_SPOT  supports
                 Linux  tasks with the X86_64 architecture on platform version
                 1.3.0 or later. FARGATE_SPOT supports Linux  tasks  with  the
                 ARM64 architecture on platform version 1.4.0 or later.

                 A  capacity  provider strategy may contain a maximum of 6 ca-
                 pacity providers.

                 capacityProvider -> (string)
                     The short name of the capacity provider.

                 weight -> (integer)
                     The weight value designates the  relative  percentage  of
                     the  total  number  of tasks launched that should use the
                     specified capacity provider. The weight  value  is  taken
                     into  consideration  after the base value, if defined, is
                     satisfied.

                     If no weight value is specified, the default value  of  0
                     is  used.  When multiple capacity providers are specified
                     within a capacity provider strategy, at least one of  the
                     capacity  providers must have a weight value greater than
                     zero and any capacity providers with a weight of 0  can't
                     be  used to place tasks. If you specify multiple capacity
                     providers in a strategy that all have a weight of 0 , any
                     RunTask  or  CreateService  actions  using  the  capacity
                     provider strategy will fail.

                     An example scenario  for  using  weights  is  defining  a
                     strategy  that  contains  two capacity providers and both
                     have a weight of 1 , then when the base is satisfied, the
                     tasks  will  be  split  evenly  across  the  two capacity
                     providers. Using that same logic, if you specify a weight
                     of  1 for capacityProviderA and a weight of 4 for capaci-
                     tyProviderB , then for every one task  that's  run  using
                     capacityProviderA   ,   four   tasks  would  use  capaci-
                     tyProviderB .

                 base -> (integer)
                     The base value designates how many tasks, at  a  minimum,
                     to  run  on the specified capacity provider. Only one ca-
                     pacity provider in a capacity provider strategy can  have
                     a  base  defined.  If  no value is specified, the default
                     value of 0 is used.

          attachments -> (list)
              The resources attached to  a  cluster.  When  using  a  capacity
              provider  with  a  cluster, the capacity provider and associated
              resources are returned as cluster attachments.

              (structure)
                 An object representing a container instance or  task  attach-
                 ment.

                 id -> (string)
                     The unique identifier for the attachment.

                 type -> (string)
                     The  type of the attachment, such as ElasticNetworkInter-
                     face , Service Connect , and AmazonElasticBlockStorage .

                 status -> (string)
                     The status of the attachment. Valid values are PRECREATED
                     , CREATED , ATTACHING , ATTACHED , DETACHING , DETACHED ,
                     DELETED , and FAILED .

                 details -> (list)
                     Details of the attachment.

                     For elastic network interfaces, this includes the network
                     interface  ID,  the  MAC  address, the subnet ID, and the
                     private IPv4 address.

                     For Service Connect services, this  includes  portName  ,
                     clientAliases , discoveryName , and ingressPortOverride .

                     For  Elastic Block Storage, this includes roleArn , dele-
                     teOnTermination , volumeName , volumeId , and  statusRea-
                     son (only when the attachment fails to create or attach).

                     (structure)
                        A key-value pair object.

                        name -> (string)
                            The  name  of  the key-value pair. For environment
                            variables, this is the  name  of  the  environment
                            variable.

                        value -> (string)
                            The  value  of the key-value pair. For environment
                            variables, this is the value  of  the  environment
                            variable.

          attachmentsStatus -> (string)
              The  status  of the capacity providers associated with the clus-
              ter. The following are the states that are returned.
                 UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS

              The available capacity providers for the cluster are updating.
                 UPDATE_COMPLETE

              The capacity providers have successfully updated.
                 UPDATE_FAILED

              The capacity provider updates failed.

          serviceConnectDefaults -> (structure)
              Use this parameter to set a default Service  Connect  namespace.
              After  you set a default Service Connect namespace, any new ser-
              vices with Service Connect turned on that  are  created  in  the
              cluster are added as client services in the namespace. This set-
              ting only applies to new services that set the enabled parameter
              to  true  in  the  ServiceConnectConfiguration . You can set the
              namespace of each service individually in the ServiceConnectCon-
              figuration to override this default parameter.

              Tasks  that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to
              services in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services  across
              all  of  the  clusters in the namespace. Tasks connect through a
              managed proxy container that collects logs and metrics  for  in-
              creased visibility. Only the tasks that Amazon ECS services cre-
              ate are supported with Service Connect.  For  more  information,
              see  Service Connect in the Amazon Elastic Container Service De-
              veloper Guide .

              namespace -> (string)
                 The namespace name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the
                 Cloud  Map  namespace.  When  you  create a service and don't
                 specify a Service Connect configuration,  this  namespace  is
                 used.



                                                              CREATE-CLUSTER()
