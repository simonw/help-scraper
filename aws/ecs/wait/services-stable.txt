SERVICES-STABLE()                                            SERVICES-STABLE()



NAME
       services-stable -

DESCRIPTION
       Wait  until  JMESPath query length(services[?!(length(deployments) == 1
       && runningCount == desiredCount)]) == 0 returns True when polling  with
       describe-services.  It  will  poll  every 15 seconds until a successful
       state has been reached. This will exit with a return code of 255  after
       40 failed checks.

SYNOPSIS
            services-stable
          [--cluster <value>]
          --services <value>
          [--include <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The  short  name  or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN)the cluster that
          hosts the service to describe. If you do not specify a cluster,  the
          default  cluster  is assumed. This parameter is required if the ser-
          vice or services you are describing were  launched  in  any  cluster
          other than the default cluster.

       --services (list)
          A list of services to describe. You may specify up to 10 services to
          describe in a single operation.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --include (list)
          Determines whether you want to see the resource tags  for  the  ser-
          vice.  If  TAGS is specified, the tags are included in the response.
          If this field is omitted, tags aren't included in the response.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            TAGS

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To pause running until a service is confirmed to be stable

       The following wait example pauses and continues only after it can  con-
       firm  that  the  specified  service running on the specified cluster is
       stable. There is no output.

          aws ecs wait services-stable \
              --cluster MyCluster \
              --services MyService

       Example 2: To pause running until a task is confirmed to be running

       The following wait example pauses and continues only after  the  speci-
       fied task enters a RUNNING state.

          aws ecs wait services-stable \
              --cluster MyCluster \
              --tasks arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:123456789012:task/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-44444EXAMPLE

OUTPUT
       None
