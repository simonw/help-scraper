DESCRIBE-TASK-SETS()                                      DESCRIBE-TASK-SETS()



NAME
       describe-task-sets -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  task sets in the specified cluster and service. This is
       used when a service uses the EXTERNAL deployment controller  type.  For
       more information, see Amazon ECS Deployment Types in the Amazon Elastic
       Container Service Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-task-sets
          --cluster <value>
          --service <value>
          [--task-sets <value>]
          [--include <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The short name or full Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the  cluster
          that hosts the service that the task sets exist in.

       --service (string)
          The  short  name  or  full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service
          that the task sets exist in.

       --task-sets (list)
          The ID or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of task sets to describe.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --include (list)
          Specifies whether to see the resource tags for the task set. If TAGS
          is  specified,  the tags are included in the response. If this field
          is omitted, tags aren't included in the response.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            TAGS

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a task set

       The following describe-task-sets example describes a task set in a ser-
       vice that uses an external deployer.

          aws ecs describe-task-sets \
              --cluster MyCluster \
              --service MyService \

OUTPUT
       taskSets -> (list)
          The list of task sets described.

          (structure)
              Information about a set of Amazon ECS tasks in either an CodeDe-
              ploy  or an EXTERNAL deployment. An Amazon ECS task set includes
              details such as the desired number of tasks, how many tasks  are
              running, and whether the task set serves production traffic.

              id -> (string)
                 The ID of the task set.

              taskSetArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task set.

              serviceArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the service the task set
                 exists in.

              clusterArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that  the  ser-
                 vice that hosts the task set exists in.

              startedBy -> (string)
                 The  tag  specified when a task set is started. If an CodeDe-
                 ploy deployment created the task set, the startedBy parameter
                 is  CODE_DEPLOY  . If an external deployment created the task
                 set, the startedBy field isn't used.

              externalId -> (string)
                 The external ID associated with the task set.

                 If an CodeDeploy deployment created a task  set,  the  exter-
                 nalId parameter contains the CodeDeploy deployment ID.

                 If  a  task  set is created for an external deployment and is
                 associated with a service discovery registry, the  externalId
                 parameter contains the ECS_TASK_SET_EXTERNAL_ID Cloud Map at-
                 tribute.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the task  set.  The  following  describes  each
                 state.
                     PRIMARY

                 The task set is serving production traffic.
                     ACTIVE

                 The task set isn't serving production traffic.
                     DRAINING

                 The tasks in the task set are being stopped, and their corre-
                 sponding targets are being  deregistered  from  their  target
                 group.

              taskDefinition -> (string)
                 The task definition that the task set is using.

              computedDesiredCount -> (integer)
                 The  computed  desired count for the task set. This is calcu-
                 lated by multiplying the service's desiredCount by  the  task
                 set's  scale percentage. The result is always rounded up. For
                 example, if the computed desired count is 1.2, it  rounds  up
                 to 2 tasks.

              pendingCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of tasks in the task set that are in the PENDING
                 status during a deployment. A task in the  PENDING  state  is
                 preparing  to  enter the RUNNING state. A task set enters the
                 PENDING status when it launches for the first  time  or  when
                 it's restarted after being in the STOPPED state.

              runningCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of tasks in the task set that are in the RUNNING
                 status during a deployment. A task in the  RUNNING  state  is
                 running and ready for use.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  Unix  timestamp  for the time when the task set was cre-
                 ated.

              updatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix timestamp for the time when the task  set  was  last
                 updated.

              launchType -> (string)
                 The launch type the tasks in the task set are using. For more
                 information, see Amazon ECS launch types in the Amazon  Elas-
                 tic Container Service Developer Guide .

              capacityProviderStrategy -> (list)
                 The  capacity  provider strategy that are associated with the
                 task set.

                 (structure)
                     The details of a capacity provider strategy.  A  capacity
                     provider  strategy  can be set when using the  RunTask or
                     CreateCluster APIs or as the  default  capacity  provider
                     strategy for a cluster with the  CreateCluster API.

                     Only  capacity providers that are already associated with
                     a cluster and have an ACTIVE or UPDATING  status  can  be
                     used  in a capacity provider strategy. The  PutClusterCa-
                     pacityProviders API  is  used  to  associate  a  capacity
                     provider with a cluster.

                     If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scal-
                     ing group, the capacity provider must already be created.
                     New  Auto Scaling group capacity providers can be created
                     with the  CreateCapacityProvider API operation.

                     To use a Fargate capacity provider,  specify  either  the
                     FARGATE  or  FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers. The Fargate
                     capacity providers are available to all accounts and only
                     need  to be associated with a cluster to be used in a ca-
                     pacity provider strategy.

                     A capacity provider strategy may contain a maximum  of  6
                     capacity providers.

                     capacityProvider -> (string)
                        The short name of the capacity provider.

                     weight -> (integer)
                        The weight value designates the relative percentage of
                        the total number of tasks launched that should use the
                        specified capacity provider. The weight value is taken
                        into consideration after the base value,  if  defined,
                        is satisfied.

                        If  no weight value is specified, the default value of
                        0 is used. When multiple capacity providers are speci-
                        fied within a capacity provider strategy, at least one
                        of the capacity providers must  have  a  weight  value
                        greater  than  zero  and any capacity providers with a
                        weight of 0 can't be used to place tasks. If you spec-
                        ify multiple capacity providers in a strategy that all
                        have a weight of 0 , any RunTask or CreateService  ac-
                        tions using the capacity provider strategy will fail.

                        An  example  scenario  for using weights is defining a
                        strategy that contains two capacity providers and both
                        have  a weight of 1 , then when the base is satisfied,
                        the tasks will be split evenly across the two capacity
                        providers.  Using  that  same  logic, if you specify a
                        weight of 1 for capacityProviderA and a  weight  of  4
                        for capacityProviderB , then for every one task that's
                        run using capacityProviderA , four tasks would use ca-
                        pacityProviderB .

                     base -> (integer)
                        The  base  value designates how many tasks, at a mini-
                        mum, to run on the specified capacity  provider.  Only
                        one  capacity provider in a capacity provider strategy
                        can have a base defined. If no value is specified, the
                        default value of 0 is used.

              platformVersion -> (string)
                 The  Fargate platform version where the tasks in the task set
                 are running. A platform version is only specified  for  tasks
                 run  on  Fargate.  For more information, see Fargate platform
                 versions in the Amazon Elastic  Container  Service  Developer
                 Guide .

              platformFamily -> (string)
                 The  operating  system that your tasks in the set are running
                 on. A platform family is specified only for  tasks  that  use
                 the Fargate launch type.

                 All tasks in the set must have the same value.

              networkConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The network configuration for the task set.

                 awsvpcConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The  VPC  subnets and security groups that are associated
                     with a task.

                     NOTE:
                        All specified subnets and security groups must be from
                        the same VPC.

                     subnets -> (list)
                        The  IDs  of  the  subnets associated with the task or
                        service. There's a limit of 16  subnets  that  can  be
                        specified per AwsVpcConfiguration .

                        NOTE:
                            All specified subnets must be from the same VPC.

                        (string)

                     securityGroups -> (list)
                        The  IDs  of  the  security groups associated with the
                        task or service.  If  you  don't  specify  a  security
                        group, the default security group for the VPC is used.
                        There's a limit of 5 security groups that can be spec-
                        ified per AwsVpcConfiguration .

                        NOTE:
                            All  specified  security  groups  must be from the
                            same VPC.

                        (string)

                     assignPublicIp -> (string)
                        Whether the task's elastic network interface  receives
                        a public IP address. The default value is DISABLED .

              loadBalancers -> (list)
                 Details on a load balancer that are used with a task set.

                 (structure)
                     The  load balancer configuration to use with a service or
                     task set.

                     For specific notes and restrictions regarding the use  of
                     load  balancers with services and task sets, see the Cre-
                     ateService and CreateTaskSet actions.

                     When you add, update, or remove a load blaancer  configu-
                     ration,  Amazon  ECS starts a new deployment with the up-
                     dated Elastic Load Balancing configuration.  This  causes
                     tasks to register to and deregister from load balancers.

                     We  recommend  that you verify this on a test environment
                     before you update the Elastic Load  Balancing  configura-
                     tion.

                     A  service-linked  role is required for services that use
                     multiple  target  groups.  For  more   information,   see
                     Service-linked roles in the Amazon Elastic Container Ser-
                     vice Developer Guide .

                     targetGroupArn -> (string)
                        The full Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the  Elastic
                        Load  Balancing target group or groups associated with
                        a service or task set.

                        A target group ARN is only specified when using an Ap-
                        plication  Load  Balancer or Network Load Balancer. If
                        you're using a Classic Load Balancer, omit the  target
                        group ARN.

                        For  services using the ECS deployment controller, you
                        can specify one or multiple target  groups.  For  more
                        information,  see  Registering  Multiple Target Groups
                        with a Service in the Amazon Elastic Container Service
                        Developer Guide .

                        For  services  using  the  CODE_DEPLOY deployment con-
                        troller, you're required to define two  target  groups
                        for  the  load  balancer.  For  more  information, see
                        Blue/Green Deployment with CodeDeploy  in  the  Amazon
                        Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                        WARNING:
                            If  your service's task definition uses the awsvpc
                            network mode, you must choose  ip  as  the  target
                            type,  not  instance  . Do this when creating your
                            target groups because tasks that  use  the  awsvpc
                            network  mode  are associated with an elastic net-
                            work interface, not an Amazon EC2  instance.  This
                            network  mode  is  required for the Fargate launch
                            type.

                     loadBalancerName -> (string)
                        The name of the load balancer to  associate  with  the
                        Amazon ECS service or task set.

                        A  load  balancer  name is only specified when using a
                        Classic Load Balancer. If you are using an Application
                        Load Balancer or a Network Load Balancer the load bal-
                        ancer name parameter should be omitted.

                     containerName -> (string)
                        The name of the container (as it  appears  in  a  con-
                        tainer  definition)  to  associate  with the load bal-
                        ancer.

                     containerPort -> (integer)
                        The port on the container to associate with  the  load
                        balancer. This port must correspond to a containerPort
                        in the task definition the tasks in  the  service  are
                        using.  For  tasks  that  use the EC2 launch type, the
                        container instance  they're  launched  on  must  allow
                        ingress traffic on the hostPort of the port mapping.

              serviceRegistries -> (list)
                 The details for the service discovery registries to assign to
                 this task set. For more information, see Service discovery .

                 (structure)
                     The details for the service registry.

                     Each service may be associated with one service registry.
                     Multiple service registries for each service are not sup-
                     ported.

                     When you add, update, or remove  the  service  registries
                     configuration,  Amazon  ECS  starts a new deployment. New
                     tasks are registered and deregistered to the updated ser-
                     vice registry configuration.

                     registryArn -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the service reg-
                        istry. The currently  supported  service  registry  is
                        Cloud Map. For more information, see CreateService .

                     port -> (integer)
                        The  port value used if your service discovery service
                        specified an SRV record. This field might be  used  if
                        both the awsvpc network mode and SRV records are used.

                     containerName -> (string)
                        The  container  name value to be used for your service
                        discovery service. It's already specified in the  task
                        definition.  If  the task definition that your service
                        task specifies uses the bridge or host  network  mode,
                        you  must  specify  a  containerName and containerPort
                        combination from the task definition. If the task def-
                        inition  that  your  service  task  specifies uses the
                        awsvpc network mode and a type SRV DNS record is used,
                        you must specify either a containerName and container-
                        Port combination or a port value. However,  you  can't
                        specify both.

                     containerPort -> (integer)
                        The  port  value to be used for your service discovery
                        service. It's already specified in  the  task  defini-
                        tion.  If the task definition your service task speci-
                        fies uses the bridge or host network  mode,  you  must
                        specify  a containerName and containerPort combination
                        from the task definition. If the task definition  your
                        service  task  specifies  uses the awsvpc network mode
                        and a type SRV DNS record is used,  you  must  specify
                        either  a  containerName and containerPort combination
                        or a port value. However, you can't specify both.

              scale -> (structure)
                 A floating-point percentage of your desired number  of  tasks
                 to place and keep running in the task set.

                 value -> (double)
                     The  value,  specified  as a percent total of a service's
                     desiredCount , to scale the task set. Accepted values are
                     numbers between 0 and 100.

                 unit -> (string)
                     The unit of measure for the scale value.

              stabilityStatus -> (string)
                 The stability status. This indicates whether the task set has
                 reached a steady state. If the following conditions are  met,
                 the task set sre in STEADY_STATE :

                 o The  task runningCount is equal to the computedDesiredCount
                   .

                 o The pendingCount is 0 .

                 o There are no tasks that are running on container  instances
                   in the DRAINING status.

                 o All tasks are reporting a healthy status from the load bal-
                   ancers, service discovery, and container health checks.

                 If any of those conditions aren't met, the  stability  status
                 returns STABILIZING .

              stabilityStatusAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  Unix  timestamp for the time when the task set stability
                 status was retrieved.

              tags -> (list)
                 The metadata that you apply to the task set to help you cate-
                 gorize  and  organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an
                 optional value. You define both.

                 The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                 o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                 o For each resource, each tag key must be  unique,  and  each
                   tag key can have only one value.

                 o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
                   resources, remember that other services may  have  restric-
                   tions  on  allowed characters. Generally allowed characters
                   are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable  in  UTF-8,
                   and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.

                 o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                 o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combina-
                   tion of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is
                   reserved  for  Amazon  Web Services use. You cannot edit or
                   delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with  this
                   prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.

                 (structure)
                     The  metadata  that  you  apply to a resource to help you
                     categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a  key
                     and an optional value. You define them.

                     The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                     o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                     o For  each  resource,  each  tag key must be unique, and
                       each tag key can have only one value.

                     o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                     o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                     o If your tagging schema is used across multiple services
                       and  resources,  remember  that other services may have
                       restrictions on allowed characters.  Generally  allowed
                       characters  are:  letters,  numbers,  and spaces repre-
                       sentable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + -  =
                       . _ : / @.

                     o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                     o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase com-
                       bination of such as a prefix for either keys or  values
                       as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You can-
                       not edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix.
                       Tags  with  this  prefix do not count against your tags
                       per resource limit.

                     key -> (string)
                        One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key
                        is  a general label that acts like a category for more
                        specific tag values.

                     value -> (string)
                        The optional part of a key-value pair that make  up  a
                        tag.  A  value acts as a descriptor within a tag cate-
                        gory (key).

       failures -> (list)
          Any failures associated with the call.

          (structure)
              A failed resource. For a list of common causes, see API  failure
              reasons  in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide
              .

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the failed resource.

              reason -> (string)
                 The reason for the failure.

              detail -> (string)
                 The details of the failure.
