OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The short name or full Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the  cluster
          that  hosts the container instances to describe. If you do not spec-
          ify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed. This parameter is re-
          quired  if the container instance or container instances you are de-
          scribing were launched in any cluster other than the  default  clus-
          ter.

       --container-instances (list)
          A  list  of up to 100 container instance IDs or full Amazon Resource
          Name (ARN) entries.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --include (list)
          Specifies whether you want to see the resource  tags  for  the  con-
          tainer  instance. If TAGS is specified, the tags are included in the
          response. If CONTAINER_INSTANCE_HEALTH is specified,  the  container
          instance  health is included in the response. If this field is omit-
          ted, tags and container instance health status  aren't  included  in
          the response.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            TAGS
            CONTAINER_INSTANCE_HEALTH

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe container instance

       The  following  describe-container-instances  example retrieves details
       for a container instance in the update cluster, using the container in-
       stance UUID as an identifier.

OUTPUT
       containerInstances -> (list)
          The list of container instances.

          (structure)
              An Amazon EC2 or External instance that's running the Amazon ECS
              agent and has been registered with a cluster.

              containerInstanceArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the container instance. For
                 more information about the ARN format,  see  Amazon  Resource
                 Name (ARN) in the Amazon ECS Developer Guide .

              ec2InstanceId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of the container instance. For Amazon EC2 instances,
                 this value is the Amazon EC2 instance ID.  For  external  in-
                 stances,  this  value is the Amazon Web Services Systems Man-
                 ager managed instance ID.

              capacityProviderName -> (string)
                 The capacity provider that's associated  with  the  container
                 instance.

              version -> (long)
                 The  version counter for the container instance. Every time a
                 container instance  experiences  a  change  that  triggers  a
                 CloudWatch  event,  the  version  counter  is incremented. If
                 you're replicating your Amazon ECS container  instance  state
                 with CloudWatch Events, you can compare the version of a con-
                 tainer instance reported by the Amazon ECS APIs with the ver-
                 sion reported in CloudWatch Events for the container instance
                 (inside the detail object) to verify that the version in your
                 event stream is current.

              versionInfo -> (structure)
                 The  version  information  for the Amazon ECS container agent
                 and Docker daemon running on the container instance.

                 agentVersion -> (string)
                     The version number of the Amazon ECS container agent.

                 agentHash -> (string)
                     The Git commit hash for the Amazon  ECS  container  agent
                     build on the amazon-ecs-agent GitHub repository.

                 dockerVersion -> (string)
                     The  Docker  version  that's running on the container in-
                     stance.

              remainingResources -> (list)
                 For CPU and memory resource types, this  parameter  describes
                 the remaining CPU and memory that wasn't already allocated to
                 tasks and is therefore available for new tasks. For port  re-
                 source  types,  this  parameter describes the ports that were
                 reserved by the Amazon ECS container agent (at instance  reg-
                 istration  time)  and  any task containers that have reserved
                 port mappings on the host (with the host  or  bridge  network
                 mode).  Any  port  that's not specified here is available for
                 new tasks.

                 (structure)
                     Describes the resources available  for  a  container  in-
                     stance.

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the resource, such as CPU , MEMORY , PORTS
                        , PORTS_UDP , or a user-defined resource.

                     type -> (string)
                        The type of the resource. Valid values: INTEGER , DOU-

                        When the doubleValue type is set, the value of the re-
                        source must be a double precision floating-point type.

                     longValue -> (long)
                        When the longValue type is set, the value of  the  re-
                        source  must  be  an extended precision floating-point
                        type.

                     integerValue -> (integer)
                        When the integerValue type is set, the  value  of  the
                        resource must be an integer.

                     stringSetValue -> (list)
                        When  the stringSetValue type is set, the value of the
                        resource must be a string type.

                        (string)

              registeredResources -> (list)

                 the  amount  of  each resource that was available on the con-
                 tainer instance when the container agent registered  it  with
                 Amazon ECS. This value represents the total amount of CPU and
                 memory that can be allocated on this  container  instance  to
                 tasks.  For port resource types, this parameter describes the
                 ports that were reserved by the Amazon  ECS  container  agent
                 when it registered the container instance with Amazon ECS.

                 DEREGISTERING , or DRAINING .

                 If  your  account  has opted in to the awsvpcTrunking account
                 setting, then any newly registered  container  instance  will
                 transition  to  a  REGISTERING status while the trunk elastic
                 network interface is provisioned for  the  instance.  If  the
                 registration  fails, the instance will transition to a REGIS-
                 TRATION_FAILED status. You can  describe  the  container  in-
                 stance and see the reason for failure in the statusReason pa-
                 rameter. Once the container instance is terminated,  the  in-
                 stance  transitions to a DEREGISTERING status while the trunk
                 elastic network interface is deprovisioned. The instance then
                 transitions to an INACTIVE status.

                 The  ACTIVE  status indicates that the container instance can
                 accept tasks. The DRAINING indicates that  new  tasks  aren't
                 placed  on  the container instance and any service tasks run-
                 ning on the container instance are removed if  possible.  For
                 more information, see Container instance draining in the Ama-
                 zon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

              statusReason -> (string)
                 The reason that the container instance  reached  its  current
                 status.

              agentConnected -> (boolean)
                 This parameter returns true if the agent is connected to Ama-
                 zon ECS. An instance with an agent that may be  unhealthy  or
                 stopped  return  false . Only instances connected to an agent
                 can accept task placement requests.

              runningTasksCount -> (integer)
                 The number of tasks on the container instance that have a de-
                 sired status (desiredStatus ) of RUNNING .

              pendingTasksCount -> (integer)
                 The number of tasks on the container instance that are in the
                 PENDING status.

              agentUpdateStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the most recent  agent  update.  If  an  update
                 wasn't ever requested, this value is NULL .

              attributes -> (list)
                 The  attributes set for the container instance, either by the
                 Amazon ECS container agent at instance registration or  manu-
                 ally with the  PutAttributes operation.

                 (structure)
                     An  attribute is a name-value pair that's associated with
                     an Amazon ECS object. Use attributes to extend the Amazon
                     ECS  data  model  by  adding  custom metadata to your re-
                     sources. For more information, see Attributes in the Ama-
                     zon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                        tween 1 and 128 characters. The name may contain  let-
                        ters  (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens (-),
                        underscores (_), forward slashes (/), back slashes (),

                     value -> (string)
                        The value of the attribute. The value must contain be-
                        tween 1 and 128 characters.  It  can  contain  letters
                        (uppercase  and  lowercase), numbers, hyphens (-), un-
                        derscores (_), periods  (.),  at  signs  (@),  forward
                        slashes  (/),  back slashes (), colons (:), or spaces.
                        The value can't start or end with a space.

                     targetType -> (string)
                        The type of the target to attach the  attribute  with.
                        This  parameter  is required if you use the short form
                        ID for a resource instead of the full ARN.

                     targetId -> (string)
                        The ID of the target. You can specify the  short  form
                        ID  for  a  resource  or the full Amazon Resource Name
                        (ARN).

              registeredAt -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix timestamp for the time when the  container  instance
                 was registered.

                        Details of the attachment.

                        For elastic network interfaces, this includes the net-
                        work interface ID, the MAC address, the subnet ID, and
                        the private IPv4 address.

                        For Service Connect services, this includes portName ,
                        clientAliases , discoveryName ,  and  ingressPortOver-

                        (structure)
                            A key-value pair object.

                            name -> (string)
                               The name of the key-value pair. For environment
                               variables,  this is the name of the environment
                               variable.

                            value -> (string)
                               The value of the key-value pair.  For  environ-
                               ment  variables, this is the value of the envi-
                               ronment variable.

              tags -> (list)
                 The metadata that you apply to the container instance to help
                 you  categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key
                 and an optional value. You define both.

                 The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                 o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                 o For each resource, each tag key must be  unique,  and  each
                   tag key can have only one value.

                 o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
                   resources, remember that other services may  have  restric-
                   tions  on  allowed characters. Generally allowed characters
                   are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable  in  UTF-8,
                   and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.

                 o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                 o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combina-
                   tion of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is
                   reserved  for  Amazon  Web Services use. You cannot edit or
                   delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with  this
                   prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.

                 (structure)
                     The  metadata  that  you  apply to a resource to help you
                     categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a  key
                     and an optional value. You define them.

                       each tag key can have only one value.

                     o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                     o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                     o If your tagging schema is used across multiple services
                       and  resources,  remember  that other services may have
                       restrictions on allowed characters.  Generally  allowed
                       characters  are:  letters,  numbers,  and spaces repre-
                       sentable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + -  =
                       . _ : / @.

                     o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                     o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase com-
                       bination of such as a prefix for either keys or  values
                       as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You can-
                       not edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix.
                       Tags  with  this  prefix do not count against your tags
                       per resource limit.

                     key -> (string)
                        One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key
                        is  a general label that acts like a category for more
                        specific tag values.

                     value -> (string)
                        The optional part of a key-value pair that make  up  a
                        tag.  A  value acts as a descriptor within a tag cate-
                        gory (key).

              healthStatus -> (structure)
                 An object representing the health status of the container in-
                 stance.

                 overallStatus -> (string)
                     The overall health status of the container instance. This
                     is an aggregate status of all container  instance  health
                     checks.

                 details -> (list)
                     An  array of objects representing the details of the con-
                     tainer instance health status.

                     (structure)
                        An object representing the result of a  container  in-
                        stance health status check.

                        type -> (string)
                            The  type of container instance health status that
                            was verified.

                        status -> (string)
                            The container instance health status.

                        lastUpdated -> (timestamp)
                            The Unix timestamp for when the container instance
                            health status was last updated.

                        lastStatusChange -> (timestamp)
                            The Unix timestamp for when the container instance
                            health status last changed.

       failures -> (list)
          Any failures associated with the call.

          (structure)
              A failed resource. For a list of common causes, see API  failure
              reasons  in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide
              .

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the failed resource.

              reason -> (string)
                 The reason for the failure.

              detail -> (string)
