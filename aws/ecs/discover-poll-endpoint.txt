SYNOPSIS
            discover-poll-endpoint
          [--container-instance <value>]
          [--cluster <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --container-instance (string)
          The container instance ID or full ARN of the container instance. The
          ARN  contains  the  arn:aws:ecs namespace, followed by the Region of
          the container instance, the Amazon Web Services account  ID  of  the
          container instance owner, the container-instance namespace, and then
          the container instance ID. For  example,  arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_ac-
          count_id:container-instance/container_instance_ID .

       --cluster (string)
          The  short  name  or  full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster
          that the container instance belongs to.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       endpoint -> (string)
          The endpoint for the Amazon ECS agent to poll.
