SYNOPSIS
            submit-attachment-state-changes
          [--cluster <value>]
          --attachments <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The short name or full ARN of the cluster that hosts  the  container
          instance the attachment belongs to.

       --attachments (list)
          Any attachments associated with the state change request.

          (structure)
              An object representing a change in state for a task attachment.

              attachmentArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the attachment.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the attachment.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attachmentArn=string,status=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "attachmentArn": "string",
              "status": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       acknowledgment -> (string)
          Acknowledgement of the state change.
