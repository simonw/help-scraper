NAME
       delete-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes one or more custom attributes from an Amazon ECS resource.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-attributes
          [--cluster <value>]
          --attributes <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The  short  name  or  full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster
          that contains the resource to delete attributes. If you do not spec-
          ify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.

       --attributes (list)
          The  attributes  to delete from your resource. You can specify up to
          10 attributes for each request. For custom attributes,  specify  the
          attribute  name  and  target ID, but don't specify the value. If you
          specify the target ID using the short form, you  must  also  specify
          the target type.

          (structure)
              An attribute is a name-value pair that's associated with an Ama-
              zon ECS object. Attributes enable you to extend the  Amazon  ECS
              data model by adding custom metadata to your resources. For more
              information, see Attributes in the Amazon Elastic Container Ser-
              vice Developer Guide .

              name -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the attribute. The name must contain between 1
                 and 128 characters. The name may contain  letters  (uppercase
                 and  lowercase),  numbers, hyphens (-), underscores (_), for-
                 ward slashes (/), back slashes (), or periods (.).

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the attribute. The value must contain between  1
                 and  128  characters.  It  can contain letters (uppercase and
                 lowercase), numbers, hyphens (-),  underscores  (_),  periods
                 (.),  at  signs  (@),  forward  slashes (/), back slashes (),
                 colons (:), or spaces. The value can't  can't  start  or  end
                 with a space.

              targetType -> (string)
                 The type of the target to attach the attribute with. This pa-
                 rameter is required if you use the short form ID  for  a  re-
                 source instead of the full ARN.

              targetId -> (string)
                 The ID of the target. You can specify the short form ID for a
                 resource or the full Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,value=string,targetType=string,targetId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "value": "string",
              "targetType": "container-instance",
              "targetId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete one or more custom attributes from an Amazon ECS resource

       The  following  delete-attributes  deletes  an  attribute with the name
       stack from a container instance.

          aws ecs delete-attributes \
              --attributes name=stack,targetId=arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:130757420319:container-instance/1c3be8ed-df30-47b4-8f1e-6e68ebd01f34

       Output:

          {
              "attributes": [

                      "targetId": "arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:130757420319:container-instance/1c3be8ed-df30-47b4-8f1e-6e68ebd01f34",
                      "value": "production"

              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       attributes -> (list)
          A list of attribute objects that were successfully deleted from your
          resource.

              An attribute is a name-value pair that's associated with an Ama-
              zon ECS object. Attributes enable you to extend the  Amazon  ECS

                 and  lowercase),  numbers, hyphens (-), underscores (_), for-

              value -> (string)

                 and  128  characters.  It  can contain letters (uppercase and
                 lowercase), numbers, hyphens (-),  underscores  (_),  periods
                 (.),  at  signs  (@),  forward  slashes (/), back slashes (),
                 colons (:), or spaces. The value can't  can't  start  or  end
                 with a space.

              targetType -> (string)
                 The type of the target to attach the attribute with. This pa-
                 rameter is required if you use the short form ID  for  a  re-

              targetId -> (string)
                 The ID of the target. You can specify the short form ID for a
                 resource or the full Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
