          that hosts the service to create the task set in.

       --external-id (string)
          An optional non-unique tag that identifies this task set in external
          systems. If the task set is associated with a service discovery reg-
          istry, the tasks in this task set will have the  ECS_TASK_SET_EXTER-
          NAL_ID Cloud Map attribute set to the provided value.

       --task-definition (string)
          The task definition for the tasks in the task set to use.

       --network-configuration (structure)
          An object representing the network configuration for a task set.

          awsvpcConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  VPC  subnets and security groups that are associated with a
              task.

              NOTE:
                 All specified subnets and security groups must  be  from  the
                 same VPC.

              subnets -> (list)
                 The  IDs  of the subnets associated with the task or service.
                 There's a limit of 16  subnets  that  can  be  specified  per
                 AwsVpcConfiguration .

                 NOTE:
                     All specified subnets must be from the same VPC.

                 (string)

              securityGroups -> (list)
                 The  IDs  of  the security groups associated with the task or
                 service. If you don't specify a security group,  the  default
                 security  group for the VPC is used. There's a limit of 5 se-
                 curity groups that can be specified per AwsVpcConfiguration .

                 NOTE:
                     All specified security groups must be from the same VPC.

                 (string)

              assignPublicIp -> (string)
                 Whether the task's elastic network interface receives a  pub-
                 lic IP address. The default value is DISABLED .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[string,string],securityGroups=[string,string],assignPublicIp=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "awsvpcConfiguration": {
              "subnets": ["string", ...],
              "securityGroups": ["string", ...],
              "assignPublicIp": "ENABLED"|"DISABLED"
            }
          }

       --load-balancers (list)
          A  load  balancer  object representing the load balancer to use with
          the task set. The supported load balancer types are either an Appli-
          cation Load Balancer or a Network Load Balancer.

          (structure)
              The  load  balancer  configuration to use with a service or task
              set.

              For specific notes and restrictions regarding the  use  of  load
              balancers with services and task sets, see the CreateService and
              CreateTaskSet actions.

              targetGroupArn -> (string)
                 The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Elastic Load  Bal-
                 ancing  target  group  or groups associated with a service or
                 task set.

                 A target group ARN is only specified when using  an  Applica-
                 tion  Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. If you're using
                 a Classic Load Balancer, omit the target group ARN.

                 For services using the ECS  deployment  controller,  you  can
                 specify  one or multiple target groups. For more information,
                 see Registering Multiple Target Groups with a Service in  the
                 Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                 For  services  using  the  CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller,
                 you're required to define two target groups for the load bal-
                 ancer.  For  more information, see Blue/Green Deployment with
                 CodeDeploy in the Amazon Elastic Container Service  Developer
                 Guide .

                 WARNING:
                     If your service's task definition uses the awsvpc network
                     mode, you must choose ip as the target type, not instance
                     .  Do this when creating your target groups because tasks
                     that use the awsvpc network mode are associated  with  an
                     elastic  network  interface,  not an Amazon EC2 instance.
                     This network mode is  required  for  the  Fargate  launch
                     type.

              loadBalancerName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the load balancer to associate with the Amazon
                 ECS service or task set.

                 A load balancer name is only specified when using  a  Classic
                 Load  Balancer. If you are using an Application Load Balancer
                 or a Network Load Balancer the load balancer  name  parameter
                 should be omitted.

              containerName -> (string)
                 The name of the container (as it appears in a container defi-
                 nition) to associate with the load balancer.

              containerPort -> (integer)
                 The port on the container to associate  with  the  load  bal-
                 ancer.  This  port  must correspond to a containerPort in the
                 task definition the tasks in the service are using. For tasks
                 that  use the EC2 launch type, the container instance they're
                 launched on must allow ingress traffic on the hostPort of the
                 port mapping.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          targetGroupArn=string,loadBalancerName=string,containerName=string,containerPort=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "targetGroupArn": "string",
              "loadBalancerName": "string",
              "containerName": "string",
              "containerPort": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --service-registries (list)
          The  details  of  the service discovery registries to assign to this
          task set. For more information, see Service Discovery .

          (structure)
              The details for the service registry.

              registryArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service  registry.  The
                 currently  supported  service registry is Cloud Map. For more
                 information, see CreateService .

              port -> (integer)
                 The port value used if your service discovery service  speci-
                 fied  an  SRV  record.  This  field might be used if both the
                 awsvpc network mode and SRV records are used.

              containerName -> (string)
                 The container name value to be used for your service  discov-
                 ery  service.  It's already specified in the task definition.
                 If the task definition that your service task specifies  uses
                 the  bridge or host network mode, you must specify a contain-
                 erName and containerPort combination from  the  task  defini-
                 tion. If the task definition that your service task specifies
                 uses the awsvpc network mode and a type  SRV  DNS  record  is
                 used,  you must specify either a containerName and container-
                 Port combination or a port value. However, you can't  specify
                 both.

              containerPort -> (integer)
                 The port value to be used for your service discovery service.
                 It's already specified in the task definition.  If  the  task
                 definition  your  service  task  specifies uses the bridge or
                 host network mode, you must specify a containerName and  con-
                 tainerPort  combination from the task definition. If the task
                 definition your service task specifies uses the  awsvpc  net-
                 work mode and a type SRV DNS record is used, you must specify
                 either a containerName and  containerPort  combination  or  a
                 port value. However, you can't specify both.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          registryArn=string,port=integer,containerName=string,containerPort=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "registryArn": "string",
              "port": integer,
              "containerName": "string",
              "containerPort": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --launch-type (string)
          The launch type that new tasks in the task set uses. For more infor-
          mation, see Amazon ECS Launch Types in the Amazon Elastic  Container
          Service Developer Guide .

          If a launchType is specified, the capacityProviderStrategy parameter
          must be omitted.

          Possible values:

          o EC2

          o FARGATE

          o EXTERNAL

       --capacity-provider-strategy (list)
          The capacity provider strategy to use for the task set.

          A capacity provider  strategy  consists  of  one  or  more  capacity
          providers along with the base and weight to assign to them. A capac-
          ity provider must be associated with the cluster to be used in a ca-
          pacity  provider  strategy.  The  PutClusterCapacityProviders API is
          used to associate a capacity provider with a cluster. Only  capacity
          providers with an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used.

          If a capacityProviderStrategy is specified, the launchType parameter
          must be omitted. If no  capacityProviderStrategy  or  launchType  is
          specified,  the  defaultCapacityProviderStrategy  for the cluster is
          used.

          If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto  Scaling  group,
          the   capacity  provider  must  already  be  created.  New  capacity
          providers can be created with the  CreateCapacityProvider API opera-
          tion.

          To  use  a  Fargate capacity provider, specify either the FARGATE or
          FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers. The Fargate capacity providers  are
          available  to  all  accounts  and  only need to be associated with a
          cluster to be used.

          The  PutClusterCapacityProviders API operation is used to update the
          list of available capacity providers for a cluster after the cluster
          is created.

          (structure)
              The details of a capacity provider strategy. A capacity provider
              strategy  can  be  set when using the  RunTask or  CreateCluster
              APIs or as the default capacity provider strategy for a  cluster
              with the  CreateCluster API.

              Only capacity providers that are already associated with a clus-
              ter and have an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used in  a  ca-
              pacity  provider  strategy. The  PutClusterCapacityProviders API
              is used to associate a capacity provider with a cluster.

              If specifying a capacity provider  that  uses  an  Auto  Scaling
              group,  the  capacity provider must already be created. New Auto
              Scaling group capacity providers can be created with  the   Cre-
              ateCapacityProvider API operation.

              To  use  a Fargate capacity provider, specify either the FARGATE
              or  FARGATE_SPOT  capacity  providers.  The   Fargate   capacity
              providers  are available to all accounts and only need to be as-
              sociated with a cluster to be used in a capacity provider strat-
              egy.

              A capacity provider strategy may contain a maximum of 6 capacity
              providers.

              capacityProvider -> (string)
                 The short name of the capacity provider.

              weight -> (integer)
                 The weight value designates the relative  percentage  of  the
                 total  number of tasks launched that should use the specified
                 capacity provider. The weight value is taken into  considera-
                 tion after the base value, if defined, is satisfied.

                 If  no  weight  value is specified, the default value of 0 is
                 used. When multiple capacity providers are specified within a
                 capacity  provider  strategy,  at  least  one of the capacity
                 providers must have a weight value greater than zero and  any
                 capacity  providers with a weight of 0 can't be used to place
                 tasks. If you specify multiple capacity providers in a strat-
                 egy  that  all have a weight of 0 , any RunTask or CreateSer-
                 vice actions using the capacity provider strategy will fail.

                 An example scenario for using weights is defining a  strategy
                 that  contains  two capacity providers and both have a weight
                 of 1 , then when the base is satisfied,  the  tasks  will  be
                 split  evenly  across  the two capacity providers. Using that
                 same logic,  if  you  specify  a  weight  of  1  for  capaci-
                 tyProviderA  and  a  weight of 4 for capacityProviderB , then
                 for every one task that's run using capacityProviderA ,  four
                 tasks would use capacityProviderB .

              base -> (integer)
                 The  base  value  designates how many tasks, at a minimum, to
                 run on the specified capacity  provider.  Only  one  capacity
                 provider  in a capacity provider strategy can have a base de-
                 fined. If no value is specified, the default value  of  0  is
                 used.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          capacityProvider=string,weight=integer,base=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "capacityProvider": "string",
              "weight": integer,
              "base": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --platform-version (string)
          The platform version that the tasks in the task set uses. A platform
          version is specified only for tasks using the Fargate  launch  type.
          If one isn't specified, the LATEST platform version is used.

       --scale (structure)
          A  floating-point percentage of the desired number of tasks to place
          and keep running in the task set.

          value -> (double)
              The value, specified as a percent total of a service's  desired-
              Count  ,  to scale the task set. Accepted values are numbers be-
              tween 0 and 100.

          unit -> (string)
              The unit of measure for the scale value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          value=double,unit=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "value": double,
            "unit": "PERCENT"
          }

       --client-token (string)
          The identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the re-
          quest.  It's  case  sensitive and must be unique. It can be up to 32
          ASCII characters are allowed.

       --tags (list)
          The metadata that you apply to the task set to help  you  categorize
          and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value.
          You define both. When a service is deleted, the tags are deleted.

          The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

          o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

          o For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each  tag  key
            can have only one value.

          o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

          o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

          o If  your  tagging  schema is used across multiple services and re-
            sources, remember that other services may have restrictions on al-
            lowed  characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, num-
            bers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following charac-
            ters: + - = . _ : / @.

          o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

          o Do  not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination of
            such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is  reserved  for
            Amazon  Web  Services  use.  You cannot edit or delete tag keys or
            values with this prefix.  Tags  with  this  prefix  do  not  count
            against your tags per resource limit.

          (structure)
              The metadata that you apply to a resource to help you categorize
              and organize them. Each tag consists of a key  and  an  optional
              value. You define them.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

              o For  each  resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o If your tagging schema is used across  multiple  services  and
                resources,  remember that other services may have restrictions
                on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are:  let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-

              key -> (string)
                 One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key  is  a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              value -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a  tag.  A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To create a task set

       The following create-task-set example creates a task set in  a  service
       that uses an external deployment controller.

          aws ecs create-task-set \
              --cluster MyCluster \
              --service MyService \
              --task-definition MyTaskDefinition:2 \
              --network-configuration "awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[subnet-12344321],securityGroups=[sg-12344321]}"

OUTPUT
       taskSet -> (structure)
          Information  about a set of Amazon ECS tasks in either an CodeDeploy
          or an EXTERNAL deployment. A task set includes details such  as  the
          desired number of tasks, how many tasks are running, and whether the
          task set serves production traffic.

          id -> (string)
              The ID of the task set.

          taskSetArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task set.

          serviceArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service the task  set  ex-
              ists in.

          clusterArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that the service
              that hosts the task set exists in.

          startedBy -> (string)
              The tag specified when a task set is started. If  an  CodeDeploy
              deployment  created  the  task  set,  the startedBy parameter is
              CODE_DEPLOY . If an external deployment created  the  task  set,
              the startedBy field isn't used.

          externalId -> (string)
              The external ID associated with the task set.

              If  an  CodeDeploy deployment created a task set, the externalId
              parameter contains the CodeDeploy deployment ID.

              If a task set is created for an external deployment and is asso-
              ciated with a service discovery registry, the externalId parame-
              ter contains the ECS_TASK_SET_EXTERNAL_ID Cloud Map attribute.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the task set. The following describes each state.
                 PRIMARY

              The task set is serving production traffic.
                 ACTIVE

              The task set isn't serving production traffic.
                 DRAINING

              The tasks in the task set are being stopped,  and  their  corre-
              sponding targets are being deregistered from their target group.

          taskDefinition -> (string)
              The task definition that the task set is using.

          computedDesiredCount -> (integer)
              The  computed desired count for the task set. This is calculated
              by multiplying the service's  desiredCount  by  the  task  set's
              scale  percentage. The result is always rounded up. For example,
              if the computed desired count is 1.2, it rounds up to 2 tasks.

          pendingCount -> (integer)
              The number of tasks in the task set that are in the PENDING sta-
              tus  during a deployment. A task in the PENDING state is prepar-
              ing to enter the RUNNING state. A task set  enters  the  PENDING
              status  when  it  launches  for  the  first  time  or  when it's
              restarted after being in the STOPPED state.

          runningCount -> (integer)
              The number of tasks in the task set that are in the RUNNING sta-
              tus  during a deployment. A task in the RUNNING state is running
              and ready for use.

          createdAt -> (timestamp)
              The Unix timestamp for the time when the task set was created.

          updatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The Unix timestamp for the time when the task set was  last  up-
              dated.

          launchType -> (string)
              The  launch  type  the tasks in the task set are using. For more
              information, see Amazon ECS launch types in the  Amazon  Elastic
              Container Service Developer Guide .

          capacityProviderStrategy -> (list)
              The capacity provider strategy that are associated with the task
              set.

              (structure)
                 The details of  a  capacity  provider  strategy.  A  capacity
                 provider strategy can be set when using the  RunTask or  Cre-
                 ateCluster APIs or as the default capacity provider  strategy
                 for a cluster with the  CreateCluster API.

                 Only  capacity  providers  that are already associated with a
                 cluster and have an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used  in
                 a   capacity   provider   strategy.   The   PutClusterCapaci-
                 tyProviders API is used to associate a capacity provider with
                 a cluster.

                 If  specifying  a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling
                 group, the capacity provider must  already  be  created.  New
                 Auto Scaling group capacity providers can be created with the
                 CreateCapacityProvider API operation.

                 To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either  the  FAR-
                 GATE or FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers. The Fargate capacity
                 providers are available to all accounts and only need  to  be
                 associated  with  a cluster to be used in a capacity provider
                 strategy.

                 A capacity provider strategy may contain a maximum of  6  ca-
                 pacity providers.

                 capacityProvider -> (string)
                     The short name of the capacity provider.

                 weight -> (integer)
                     The  weight  value  designates the relative percentage of
                     the total number of tasks launched that  should  use  the
                     specified  capacity  provider.  The weight value is taken
                     into consideration after the base value, if  defined,  is
                     satisfied.

                     If  no  weight value is specified, the default value of 0
                     is used. When multiple capacity providers  are  specified
                     within  a capacity provider strategy, at least one of the
                     capacity providers must have a weight value greater  than
                     zero  and any capacity providers with a weight of 0 can't
                     be used to place tasks. If you specify multiple  capacity
                     providers in a strategy that all have a weight of 0 , any
                     RunTask  or  CreateService  actions  using  the  capacity
                     provider strategy will fail.

                     An  example  scenario  for  using  weights  is defining a
                     strategy that contains two capacity  providers  and  both
                     have a weight of 1 , then when the base is satisfied, the
                     tasks will  be  split  evenly  across  the  two  capacity
                     providers. Using that same logic, if you specify a weight
                     of 1 for capacityProviderA and a weight of 4 for  capaci-
                     tyProviderB  ,  then  for every one task that's run using
                     capacityProviderA  ,  four  tasks   would   use   capaci-
                     tyProviderB .

                 base -> (integer)
                     The  base  value designates how many tasks, at a minimum,
                     to run on the specified capacity provider. Only  one  ca-
                     pacity  provider in a capacity provider strategy can have
                     a base defined. If no value  is  specified,  the  default
                     value of 0 is used.

          platformVersion -> (string)
              The Fargate platform version where the tasks in the task set are
              running. A platform version is only specified for tasks  run  on
              Fargate.  For more information, see Fargate platform versions in
              the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

          platformFamily -> (string)
              The operating system that your tasks in the set are running  on.
              A  platform family is specified only for tasks that use the Far-
              gate launch type.

              All tasks in the set must have the same value.

          networkConfiguration -> (structure)
              The network configuration for the task set.

              awsvpcConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The VPC subnets and security groups that are associated  with
                 a task.

                 NOTE:
                     All  specified  subnets  and security groups must be from
                     the same VPC.

                 subnets -> (list)
                     The IDs of the subnets associated with the task  or  ser-
                     vice. There's a limit of 16 subnets that can be specified
                     per AwsVpcConfiguration .

                     NOTE:
                        All specified subnets must be from the same VPC.

                     (string)

                 securityGroups -> (list)
                     The IDs of the security groups associated with  the  task
                     or  service.  If  you don't specify a security group, the
                     default security group for the VPC  is  used.  There's  a
                     limit  of  5  security  groups  that can be specified per
                     AwsVpcConfiguration .

                     NOTE:
                        All specified security groups must be  from  the  same
                        VPC.

                     (string)

                 assignPublicIp -> (string)
                     Whether  the  task's elastic network interface receives a
                     public IP address. The default value is DISABLED .

          loadBalancers -> (list)
              Details on a load balancer that are used with a task set.

              (structure)
                 The load balancer configuration to use with a service or task
                 set.

                 For specific notes and restrictions regarding the use of load
                 balancers with services and task sets, see the  CreateService
                 and CreateTaskSet actions.

                 targetGroupArn -> (string)
                     The  full  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Elastic Load
                     Balancing target group or groups associated with  a  ser-
                     vice or task set.

                     A target group ARN is only specified when using an Appli-
                     cation Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. If  you're
                     using a Classic Load Balancer, omit the target group ARN.

                     For services using the ECS deployment controller, you can
                     specify one or multiple target groups. For more  informa-
                     tion,  see Registering Multiple Target Groups with a Ser-
                     vice in the Amazon Elastic  Container  Service  Developer
                     Guide .

                     For services using the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller,
                     you're required to define two target groups for the  load
                     balancer. For more information, see Blue/Green Deployment
                     with CodeDeploy in the Amazon Elastic  Container  Service
                     Developer Guide .

                     WARNING:
                        If your service's task definition uses the awsvpc net-
                        work mode, you must choose ip as the target type,  not
                        instance  .  Do  this when creating your target groups
                        because tasks that use the awsvpc network mode are as-
                        sociated  with  an  elastic  network interface, not an
                        Amazon EC2 instance. This network mode is required for
                        the Fargate launch type.

                 loadBalancerName -> (string)
                     The  name of the load balancer to associate with the Ama-
                     zon ECS service or task set.

                     A load balancer name is only specified when using a Clas-
                     sic  Load  Balancer. If you are using an Application Load
                     Balancer or a Network Load  Balancer  the  load  balancer
                     name parameter should be omitted.

                 containerName -> (string)
                     The  name  of the container (as it appears in a container
                     definition) to associate with the load balancer.

                 containerPort -> (integer)
                     The port on the container to associate with the load bal-
                     ancer.  This  port  must correspond to a containerPort in
                     the task definition the tasks in the service  are  using.
                     For tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the container in-
                     stance they're launched on must allow ingress traffic  on
                     the hostPort of the port mapping.

          serviceRegistries -> (list)
              The  details  for  the service discovery registries to assign to
              this task set. For more information, see Service discovery .

              (structure)
                 The details for the service registry.

                 registryArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  service  registry.

                 port -> (integer)
                     The port value used if  your  service  discovery  service
                     specified an SRV record. This field might be used if both
                     the awsvpc network mode and SRV records are used.

                 containerName -> (string)
                     The container name value to be used for your service dis-
                     covery  service. It's already specified in the task defi-
                     nition. If the task definition  that  your  service  task
                     specifies  uses the bridge or host network mode, you must
                     specify a  containerName  and  containerPort  combination
                     from  the  task  definition.  If the task definition that
                     your service task specifies uses the awsvpc network  mode
                     and  a  type SRV DNS record is used, you must specify ei-
                     ther a containerName and containerPort combination  or  a
                     port value. However, you can't specify both.

                 containerPort -> (integer)
                     The port value to be used for your service discovery ser-
                     vice. It's already specified in the task  definition.  If
                     the  task definition your service task specifies uses the
                     bridge or host network mode, you must specify a  contain-
                     erName  and containerPort combination from the task defi-
                     nition. If the task definition your service  task  speci-
                     fies  uses  the  awsvpc  network  mode and a type SRV DNS
                     record is used, you must specify either  a  containerName
                     and  containerPort  combination or a port value. However,
                     you can't specify both.

          scale -> (structure)
              A floating-point percentage of your desired number of  tasks  to
              place and keep running in the task set.

              value -> (double)
                 The  value,  specified  as a percent total of a service's de-
                 siredCount , to scale the task set. Accepted values are  num-
                 bers between 0 and 100.

              unit -> (string)
                 The unit of measure for the scale value.

          stabilityStatus -> (string)
              The  stability  status.  This indicates whether the task set has
              reached a steady state. If the following conditions are met, the
              task set sre in STEADY_STATE :

              o The task runningCount is equal to the computedDesiredCount .

              o The pendingCount is 0 .

              o There  are no tasks that are running on container instances in
                the DRAINING status.

              o All tasks are reporting a healthy status from  the  load  bal-
                ancers, service discovery, and container health checks.

              If  any of those conditions aren't met, the stability status re-
              turns STABILIZING .

          stabilityStatusAt -> (timestamp)
              The Unix timestamp for the time when the task set stability sta-
              tus was retrieved.

          tags -> (list)
              The  metadata that you apply to the task set to help you catego-
              rize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key  and  an  op-
              tional value. You define both.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

              o For  each  resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o If your tagging schema is used across  multiple  services  and
                resources,  remember that other services may have restrictions
                on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are:  let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
                lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.

              o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

              o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination
                of  such  as  a  prefix for either keys or values as it is re-
                served for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or  delete
                tag  keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do
                not count against your tags per resource limit.

              (structure)
                 The metadata that you apply to a resource to help you catego-
                 rize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an op-
                 tional value. You define them.

                   tag key can have only one value.

                 o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
                   resources, remember that other services may  have  restric-
                   tions  on  allowed characters. Generally allowed characters
                   are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable  in  UTF-8,
                   and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.

                 o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                 o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combina-
                   tion of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is
                   reserved  for  Amazon  Web Services use. You cannot edit or
                   delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with  this
                   prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.

                 key -> (string)
                     One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is
                     a general label that acts like a category for  more  spe-
                     cific tag values.

                 value -> (string)
                     The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a tag.
                     A value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).
