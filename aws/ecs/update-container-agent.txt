UPDATE-CONTAINER-AGENT()                              UPDATE-CONTAINER-AGENT()



NAME
       update-container-agent -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  Amazon  ECS  container agent on a specified container in-
       stance. Updating the Amazon ECS container agent doesn't interrupt  run-
       ning  tasks  or services on the container instance. The process for up-
       dating the agent differs depending on whether your  container  instance
       was  launched  with  the  Amazon ECS-optimized AMI or another operating
       system.

       NOTE:
          The UpdateContainerAgent API isn't supported for container instances
          using the Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 (arm64) AMI. To update
          the container agent, you can update the ecs-init package.  This  up-
          dates  the  agent. For more information, see Updating the Amazon ECS
          container agent in the Amazon Elastic  Container  Service  Developer
          Guide .

       NOTE:
          Agent updates with the UpdateContainerAgent API operation do not ap-
          ply to Windows container instances. We recommend that you launch new
          container  instances  to  update  the  agent version in your Windows
          clusters.

       The UpdateContainerAgent API requires an Amazon  ECS-optimized  AMI  or
       Amazon  Linux  AMI with the ecs-init service installed and running. For
       help updating the Amazon ECS container agent on  other  operating  sys-
       tems,  see Manually updating the Amazon ECS container agent in the Ama-
       zon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The short name or full Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the  cluster
          that  your container instance is running on. If you do not specify a
          cluster, the default cluster is assumed.

       --container-instance (string)
          The container instance ID or full ARN entries for the container  in-
          stance  where  you  would  like  to  update the Amazon ECS container
          agent.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       the Amazon ECS Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       containerInstance -> (structure)
          The container instance that the container agent was updated for.

          containerInstanceArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  container  instance.  For
              more  information about the ARN format, see Amazon Resource Name
              (ARN) in the Amazon ECS Developer Guide .

          ec2InstanceId -> (string)
              The ID of the container instance. For Amazon EC2 instances, this
              value  is  the  Amazon  EC2 instance ID. For external instances,
              this value is the Amazon Web Services  Systems  Manager  managed
              instance ID.

          capacityProviderName -> (string)
              The  capacity  provider that's associated with the container in-
              stance.

          version -> (long)
              The version counter for the container  instance.  Every  time  a
              container  instance  experiences a change that triggers a Cloud-
              Watch event, the  version  counter  is  incremented.  If  you're
              replicating your Amazon ECS container instance state with Cloud-
              Watch Events, you can compare the version  of  a  container  in-
              stance reported by the Amazon ECS APIs with the version reported
              in CloudWatch Events for the container instance (inside the  de-
              tail  object) to verify that the version in your event stream is
              current.

          versionInfo -> (structure)
              The version information for the Amazon ECS container  agent  and
              Docker daemon running on the container instance.

              agentVersion -> (string)
                 The version number of the Amazon ECS container agent.

              agentHash -> (string)
                 The  Git commit hash for the Amazon ECS container agent build
                 on the amazon-ecs-agent GitHub repository.

              dockerVersion -> (string)
                 The Docker version that's running on the container instance.

          remainingResources -> (list)
              For CPU and memory resource types, this parameter describes  the
              remaining  CPU and memory that wasn't already allocated to tasks
              and is therefore available for  new  tasks.  For  port  resource
              types,  this parameter describes the ports that were reserved by
              the Amazon ECS container agent (at instance  registration  time)
              and  any task containers that have reserved port mappings on the
              host (with the host or bridge network mode). Any port that's not
              specified here is available for new tasks.

              (structure)
                 Describes the resources available for a container instance.

                 name -> (string)
                     The  name of the resource, such as CPU , MEMORY , PORTS ,

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of the resource. Valid values: INTEGER ,  DOUBLE
                     , LONG , or STRINGSET .

                 doubleValue -> (double)
                     When  the  doubleValue  type is set, the value of the re-

                     (string)

          registeredResources -> (list)
              For  CPU and memory resource types, this parameter describes the
              amount of each resource that was available on the container  in-
              stance  when  the container agent registered it with Amazon ECS.
              This value represents the total amount of CPU  and  memory  that
              can  be  allocated on this container instance to tasks. For port
              resource types, this parameter describes the ports that were re-
              served  by the Amazon ECS container agent when it registered the
              container instance with Amazon ECS.

              (structure)
                 Describes the resources available for a container instance.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the resource, such as CPU , MEMORY , PORTS  ,
                     PORTS_UDP , or a user-defined resource.

                     source must be a double precision floating-point type.

                 longValue -> (long)
                     When the longValue type is set, the value of the resource
                     must be an extended precision floating-point type.

                 integerValue -> (integer)
                     When the integerValue type is set, the value of  the  re-
                     source must be an integer.

                 stringSetValue -> (list)
                     When the stringSetValue type is set, the value of the re-
                     source must be a string type.

                     (string)

          status -> (string)
              The status of the container instance. The valid values are  REG-
              ISTERING , REGISTRATION_FAILED , ACTIVE , INACTIVE , DEREGISTER-
              ING , or DRAINING .

              If your account has opted in to the awsvpcTrunking account  set-
              ting,  then any newly registered container instance will transi-
              tion to a REGISTERING status while the trunk elastic network in-
              terface  is  provisioned  for  the instance. If the registration
              fails, the instance will  transition  to  a  REGISTRATION_FAILED
              status. You can describe the container instance and see the rea-
              son for failure in the statusReason  parameter.  Once  the  con-
              tainer  instance  is  terminated,  the instance transitions to a
              DEREGISTERING status while the trunk elastic  network  interface
              is  deprovisioned.  The instance then transitions to an INACTIVE
              status.

              The ACTIVE status indicates that the container instance can  ac-
              cept  tasks. The DRAINING indicates that new tasks aren't placed
              on the container instance and any service tasks running  on  the
              container  instance  are  removed if possible. For more informa-
              tion, see Container instance draining in the Amazon Elastic Con-
              tainer Service Developer Guide .

          statusReason -> (string)
              The  reason that the container instance reached its current sta-
              tus.

          agentConnected -> (boolean)
              This parameter returns true if the agent is connected to  Amazon
              ECS.  An instance with an agent that may be unhealthy or stopped
              return false . Only instances connected to an agent  can  accept
              task placement requests.

          runningTasksCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of  tasks on the container instance that have a de-
              sired status (desiredStatus ) of RUNNING .

          pendingTasksCount -> (integer)
              The number of tasks on the container instance that  are  in  the
              PENDING status.

          agentUpdateStatus -> (string)
              The  status of the most recent agent update. If an update wasn't
              ever requested, this value is NULL .

          attributes -> (list)
              The attributes set for the container  instance,  either  by  the
              Amazon  ECS container agent at instance registration or manually
              with the  PutAttributes operation.

              (structure)
                 An attribute is a name-value pair that's associated  with  an
                 Amazon  ECS  object.  Use attributes to extend the Amazon ECS
                 data model by adding custom metadata to your  resources.  For
                 more  information,  see Attributes in the Amazon Elastic Con-

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the attribute. The name must contain  between
                     1  and  128 characters. The name may contain letters (up-
                     percase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens (-), underscores
                     (_),  forward  slashes  (/),  back slashes (), or periods

                 value -> (string)
                     The value of the attribute. The value  must  contain  be-
                     tween  1  and 128 characters. It can contain letters (up-
                     percase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens (-), underscores
                     (_), periods (.), at signs (@), forward slashes (/), back
                     slashes (), colons (:), or spaces. The value can't  start
                     or end with a space.

                 targetType -> (string)
                     The type of the target to attach the attribute with. This
                     parameter is required if you use the short form ID for  a
                     resource instead of the full ARN.

                 targetId -> (string)
                     The  ID  of the target. You can specify the short form ID

          tags -> (list)
              The  metadata  that  you apply to the container instance to help
              you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and
              an optional value. You define both.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

              o For  each  resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o If your tagging schema is used across  multiple  services  and
                resources,  remember that other services may have restrictions
                on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are:  let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
                lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.

              o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

              o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination
                of  such  as  a  prefix for either keys or values as it is re-
                served for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or  delete
                tag  keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do
                not count against your tags per resource limit.

              (structure)
                 The metadata that you apply to a resource to help you catego-
                 rize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an op-
                 tional value. You define them.

                   prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.

                 key -> (string)
                     One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is
                     a general label that acts like a category for  more  spe-
                     cific tag values.

                 value -> (string)
                     The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a tag.
                     A value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

          healthStatus -> (structure)
              An object representing the health status of  the  container  in-
              stance.

              overallStatus -> (string)
                 The  overall health status of the container instance. This is
                 an aggregate status of all container instance health checks.

              details -> (list)
                 An array of objects representing the details of the container
                 instance health status.

                 (structure)
                     An object representing the result of a container instance
                     health status check.

                     type -> (string)
                        The type of container instance health status that  was
                        verified.

                     status -> (string)
                        The container instance health status.

                     lastUpdated -> (timestamp)
                        The  Unix  timestamp  for  when the container instance
                        health status was last updated.

                     lastStatusChange -> (timestamp)
                        The Unix timestamp for  when  the  container  instance
                        health status last changed.
