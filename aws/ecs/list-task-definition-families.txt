LIST-TASK-DEFINITION-FAMILIES()                LIST-TASK-DEFINITION-FAMILIES()



NAME
       list-task-definition-families -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of task definition families that are registered to your
       account. This list includes task definition  families  that  no  longer
       have any ACTIVE task definition revisions.

       You  can filter out task definition families that don't contain any AC-
       TIVE task definition revisions by setting the status parameter  to  AC-
       TIVE . You can also filter the results with the familyPrefix parameter.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-task-definition-families  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: families

SYNOPSIS
            list-task-definition-families
          [--family-prefix <value>]
          [--status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --family-prefix (string)
          The familyPrefix is a string that's used to filter  the  results  of
          ListTaskDefinitionFamilies  .  If  you specify a familyPrefix , only
          task definition family names that begin with the familyPrefix string
          are returned.

       --status (string)
          The  task definition family status to filter the ListTaskDefinition-
          Families results with. By default, both  ACTIVE  and  INACTIVE  task
          definition families are listed. If this parameter is set to ACTIVE ,
          only task definition families that have an  ACTIVE  task  definition
          revision  are  returned. If this parameter is set to INACTIVE , only
          task definition families that do not have any ACTIVE task definition
          revisions  are  returned.  If  you paginate the resulting output, be
          sure to keep the status value constant in each subsequent request.

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o INACTIVE

          o ALL

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To list the registered task definition families

       The  following  list-task-definition-families  example lists all of the
       registered task definition families.

          aws ecs list-task-definition-families

       Output:

          {
              "families": [
                  "node-js-app",
                  "web-timer",
                  "hpcc",
                  "hpcc-c4-8xlarge"
              ]
          }

       Example 2: To filter the registered task definition families

       The following list-task-definition-families example lists the task def-
       inition revisions that start with "hpcc".

          aws ecs list-task-definition-families --family-prefix hpcc

       Output:

          {
              "families": [
                  "hpcc",
                  "hpcc-c4-8xlarge"
              ]
          }

       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       families -> (list)
          The list of task definition family names that match the ListTaskDef-
          initionFamilies request.

          (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  nextToken  value to include in a future ListTaskDefinitionFami-
          lies request. When the results of a  ListTaskDefinitionFamilies  re-
          quest  exceed  maxResults  ,  this value can be used to retrieve the
          next page of results. This value is null when there are no more  re-
          sults to return.
