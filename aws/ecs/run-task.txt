RUN-TASK()                                                          RUN-TASK()



NAME
       run-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts a new task using the specified task definition.

       You  can  allow Amazon ECS to place tasks for you, or you can customize
       how Amazon ECS places tasks using placement constraints  and  placement
       strategies.  For  more  information, see Scheduling Tasks in the Amazon
       Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

       Alternatively, you can use  StartTask to  use  your  own  scheduler  or
       place tasks manually on specific container instances.

       The  Amazon  ECS API follows an eventual consistency model. This is be-
       cause of the distributed nature of the system supporting the API.  This
       means  that the result of an API command you run that affects your Ama-
       zon ECS resources might not be immediately visible  to  all  subsequent
       commands  you  run. Keep this in mind when you carry out an API command
       that immediately follows a previous API command.

       To manage eventual consistency, you can do the following:

       o Confirm the state of the resource before you run a command to  modify
         it.  Run the DescribeTasks command using an exponential backoff algo-
         rithm to ensure that you allow enough time for the  previous  command
         to  propagate  through  the system. To do this, run the DescribeTasks
         command repeatedly, starting with a couple of seconds  of  wait  time
         and increasing gradually up to five minutes of wait time.

       o Add  wait time between subsequent commands, even if the DescribeTasks
         command returns an accurate response. Apply  an  exponential  backoff
         algorithm  starting  with  a  couple of seconds of wait time, and in-
         crease gradually up to about five minutes of wait time.

OPTIONS
       --capacity-provider-strategy (list)
          The capacity provider strategy to use for the task.

          If a capacityProviderStrategy is specified, the launchType parameter
          must  be  omitted.  If  no capacityProviderStrategy or launchType is
          specified, the defaultCapacityProviderStrategy for  the  cluster  is
          used.

          When  you  use  cluster  auto  scaling,  you  must  specify  capaci-
          tyProviderStrategy and not launchType .

          A capacity provider strategy may contain a  maximum  of  6  capacity
          providers.

          (structure)
              The details of a capacity provider strategy. A capacity provider
              strategy can be set when using the   RunTask  or   CreateCluster
              APIs  or as the default capacity provider strategy for a cluster
              with the  CreateCluster API.

              Only capacity providers that are already associated with a clus-
              ter  and  have an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used in a ca-
              pacity provider strategy. The   PutClusterCapacityProviders  API
              is used to associate a capacity provider with a cluster.

              If  specifying  a  capacity  provider  that uses an Auto Scaling
              group, the capacity provider must already be created.  New  Auto
              Scaling  group  capacity providers can be created with the  Cre-
              ateCapacityProvider API operation.

              To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either  the  FARGATE
              or   FARGATE_SPOT   capacity  providers.  The  Fargate  capacity
              providers are available to all accounts and only need to be  as-
              sociated with a cluster to be used in a capacity provider strat-
              egy.

              A capacity provider strategy may contain a maximum of 6 capacity
              providers.

              capacityProvider -> (string)
                 The short name of the capacity provider.

              weight -> (integer)
                 The  weight  value  designates the relative percentage of the
                 total number of tasks launched that should use the  specified
                 capacity  provider. The weight value is taken into considera-
                 tion after the base value, if defined, is satisfied.

                 If no weight value is specified, the default value  of  0  is
                 used. When multiple capacity providers are specified within a
                 capacity provider strategy, at  least  one  of  the  capacity
                 providers  must have a weight value greater than zero and any
                 capacity providers with a weight of 0 can't be used to  place
                 tasks. If you specify multiple capacity providers in a strat-
                 egy that all have a weight of 0 , any RunTask  or  CreateSer-
                 vice actions using the capacity provider strategy will fail.

                 An  example scenario for using weights is defining a strategy
                 that contains two capacity providers and both have  a  weight
                 of  1  ,  then  when the base is satisfied, the tasks will be
                 split evenly across the two capacity  providers.  Using  that
                 same  logic,  if  you  specify  a  weight  of  1  for capaci-
                 tyProviderA and a weight of 4 for  capacityProviderB  ,  then
                 for  every one task that's run using capacityProviderA , four
                 tasks would use capacityProviderB .

              base -> (integer)
                 The base value designates how many tasks, at  a  minimum,  to
                 run  on  the  specified  capacity provider. Only one capacity
                 provider in a capacity provider strategy can have a base  de-
                 fined.  If  no  value is specified, the default value of 0 is
                 used.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          capacityProvider=string,weight=integer,base=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "capacityProvider": "string",
              "weight": integer,
              "base": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cluster (string)
          The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster  to
          run your task on. If you do not specify a cluster, the default clus-
          ter is assumed.

       --count (integer)
          The number of instantiations of the specified task to place on  your
          cluster. You can specify up to 10 tasks for each call.

       --enable-ecs-managed-tags | --no-enable-ecs-managed-tags (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  to use Amazon ECS managed tags for the task. For
          more information, see Tagging Your Amazon ECS Resources in the  Ama-
          zon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

       --enable-execute-command | --disable-execute-command (boolean)
          Determines  whether to use the execute command functionality for the
          containers in this task. If true  ,  this  enables  execute  command
          functionality on all containers in the task.

          If  true  ,  then  the task definition must have a task role, or you
          must provide one as an override.

       --group (string)
          The name of the task group to associate with the task.  The  default
          value  is  the family name of the task definition (for example, fam-
          ily:my-family-name ).

       --launch-type (string)
          The infrastructure to run your standalone task on. For more informa-
          tion,  see  Amazon  ECS launch types in the Amazon Elastic Container
          Service Developer Guide .

          The FARGATE launch type runs your tasks on Fargate On-Demand  infra-
          structure.

          NOTE:
              Fargate  Spot infrastructure is available for use but a capacity
              provider strategy  must  be  used.  For  more  information,  see
              Fargate capacity providers in the Amazon ECS User Guide for Far-
              gate .

          The EC2 launch type runs your tasks on Amazon EC2  instances  regis-
          tered to your cluster.

          The  EXTERNAL launch type runs your tasks on your on-premises server
          or virtual machine (VM) capacity registered to your cluster.

          A task can use either a launch type or a capacity provider strategy.
          If a launchType is specified, the capacityProviderStrategy parameter
          must be omitted.

          When  you  use  cluster  auto  scaling,  you  must  specify  capaci-
          tyProviderStrategy and not launchType .

          Possible values:

          o EC2

          o FARGATE

          o EXTERNAL

       --network-configuration (structure)
          The  network  configuration for the task. This parameter is required
          for task definitions that use the awsvpc  network  mode  to  receive
          their  own  elastic  network  interface,  and it isn't supported for
          other network modes. For more information, see  Task  networking  in
          the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

          awsvpcConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  VPC  subnets and security groups that are associated with a
              task.

              NOTE:
                 All specified subnets and security groups must  be  from  the
                 same VPC.

              subnets -> (list)
                 The  IDs  of the subnets associated with the task or service.
                 There's a limit of 16  subnets  that  can  be  specified  per
                 AwsVpcConfiguration .

                 NOTE:
                     All specified subnets must be from the same VPC.

                 (string)

              securityGroups -> (list)
                 The  IDs  of  the security groups associated with the task or
                 service. If you don't specify a security group,  the  default
                 security  group for the VPC is used. There's a limit of 5 se-
                 curity groups that can be specified per AwsVpcConfiguration .

                 NOTE:
                     All specified security groups must be from the same VPC.

                 (string)

              assignPublicIp -> (string)
                 Whether the task's elastic network interface receives a  pub-
                 lic IP address. The default value is DISABLED .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[string,string],securityGroups=[string,string],assignPublicIp=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "awsvpcConfiguration": {
              "subnets": ["string", ...],
              "securityGroups": ["string", ...],
              "assignPublicIp": "ENABLED"|"DISABLED"
            }
          }

       --overrides (structure)
          A  list  of container overrides in JSON format that specify the name
          of a container in the specified task definition and the overrides it
          should receive. You can override the default command for a container
          (that's specified in the task definition or  Docker  image)  with  a
          command  override.  You can also override existing environment vari-
          ables (that are specified in the task definition or Docker image) on
          a  container or add new environment variables to it with an environ-
          ment override.

          A total of 8192 characters are allowed for overrides. This limit in-
          cludes the JSON formatting characters of the override structure.

          containerOverrides -> (list)
              One or more container overrides that are sent to a task.

              (structure)
                 The  overrides  that  are  sent to a container. An empty con-
                 tainer override can be passed in. An example of an empty con-
                 tainer  override  is  {"containerOverrides":  [  ]  }  . If a
                 non-empty container override is specified, the name parameter
                 must be included.

                 name -> (string)
                     The  name  of  the  container that receives the override.
                     This parameter is required if any override is specified.

                 command -> (list)
                     The command to send to the container that  overrides  the
                     default command from the Docker image or the task defini-
                     tion. You must also specify a container name.

                     (string)

                 environment -> (list)
                     The environment variables to send to the  container.  You
                     can add new environment variables, which are added to the
                     container at launch, or you can override the existing en-
                     vironment  variables  from  the  Docker image or the task
                     definition. You must also specify a container name.

                     (structure)
                        A key-value pair object.

                        name -> (string)
                            The name of the key-value  pair.  For  environment
                            variables,  this  is  the  name of the environment
                            variable.

                        value -> (string)
                            The value of the key-value pair.  For  environment
                            variables,  this  is  the value of the environment
                            variable.

                 environmentFiles -> (list)
                     A list of files containing the environment  variables  to
                     pass  to  a container, instead of the value from the con-
                     tainer definition.

                     (structure)
                        A list of files containing the  environment  variables
                        to  pass to a container. You can specify up to ten en-
                        vironment files. The file must have a .env file exten-
                        sion.  Each line in an environment file should contain
                        an  environment  variable  in  VARIABLE=VALUE  format.
                        Lines beginning with # are treated as comments and are
                        ignored. For more information  about  the  environment
                        variable  file syntax, see Declare default environment
                        variables in file .

                        If there are environment variables specified using the
                        environment  parameter in a container definition, they
                        take precedence over the variables contained within an
                        environment  file.  If  multiple environment files are
                        specified that contain the same variable, they're pro-
                        cessed  from  the  top down. We recommend that you use
                        unique  variable  names.  For  more  information,  see
                        Specifying environment variables in the Amazon Elastic
                        Container Service Developer Guide .

                        This parameter is only supported for tasks  hosted  on
                        Fargate using the following platform versions:

                        o Linux platform version 1.4.0 or later.

                        o Windows platform version 1.0.0 or later.

                        value -> (string)
                            The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the Amazon S3
                            object containing the environment variable file.

                        type -> (string)
                            The file type to use. The only supported value  is
                            s3 .

                 cpu -> (integer)
                     The  number  of cpu units reserved for the container, in-
                     stead of the default value from the task definition.  You
                     must also specify a container name.

                 memory -> (integer)
                     The  hard limit (in MiB) of memory to present to the con-
                     tainer, instead of the default value from the task  defi-
                     nition.  If  your container attempts to exceed the memory
                     specified here, the container is killed.  You  must  also
                     specify a container name.

                 memoryReservation -> (integer)
                     The soft limit (in MiB) of memory to reserve for the con-
                     tainer, instead of the default value from the task  defi-
                     nition. You must also specify a container name.

                 resourceRequirements -> (list)
                     The  type  and  amount  of a resource to assign to a con-
                     tainer, instead of the default value from the task  defi-
                     nition. The only supported resource is a GPU.

                     (structure)
                        The  type and amount of a resource to assign to a con-
                        tainer. The supported  resource  types  are  GPUs  and
                        Elastic  Inference accelerators. For more information,
                        see Working with GPUs on Amazon ECS  or  Working  with
                        Amazon  Elastic  Inference on Amazon ECS in the Amazon
                        Elastic Container Service Developer Guide

                        value -> (string)
                            The value for the specified resource type.

                            If the GPU type is used, the value is  the  number
                            of  physical  GPUs  the Amazon ECS container agent
                            reserves for the container.  The  number  of  GPUs
                            that's reserved for all containers in a task can't
                            exceed the number of available GPUs  on  the  con-
                            tainer instance that the task is launched on.

                            If  the  InferenceAccelerator  type  is  used, the
                            value matches the deviceName for an   InferenceAc-
                            celerator specified in a task definition.

                        type -> (string)
                            The type of resource to assign to a container. The
                            supported values are GPU or InferenceAccelerator .

          cpu -> (string)
              The cpu override for the task.

          inferenceAcceleratorOverrides -> (list)

                 deviceName -> (string)
                     The Elastic Inference accelerator device name to override
                     for  the  task.  This  parameter  must match a deviceName
                     specified in the task definition.

                 deviceType -> (string)
                     The Elastic Inference accelerator type to use.

          executionRoleArn -> (string)

              the permissions that are specified in this role. For more infor-
              mation, see IAM Role for Tasks in the Amazon  Elastic  Container
              Service Developer Guide .

          ephemeralStorage -> (structure)
              The ephemeral storage setting override for the task.

              NOTE:

       --placement-constraints (list)
          An array of placement constraint objects to use for  the  task.  You
          can  specify  up  to  10  constraints  for each task (including con-
          straints in the task definition and those specified at runtime).

          (structure)
              An object representing a constraint on task placement. For  more
              information,  see Task placement constraints in the Amazon Elas-
              tic Container Service Developer Guide .

              NOTE:
                 If you're using the Fargate launch type, task placement  con-
                 straints aren't supported.

              type -> (string)
                 The  type  of constraint. Use distinctInstance to ensure that
                 each task in a particular group is  running  on  a  different
                 container instance. Use memberOf to restrict the selection to
                 a group of valid candidates.

              expression -> (string)
                 A cluster query language expression  to  apply  to  the  con-
                 straint.  The  expression  can  have a maximum length of 2000
                 characters. You can't specify an expression if the constraint
                 type  is distinctInstance . For more information, see Cluster
                 query language in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Devel-
                 oper Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          type=string,expression=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "type": "distinctInstance"|"memberOf",
              "expression": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --placement-strategy (list)
          The  placement strategy objects to use for the task. You can specify
          a maximum of 5 strategy rules for each task.

          (structure)
              The task placement strategy for a task or service. For more  in-
              formation,  see  Task placement strategies in the Amazon Elastic
              Container Service Developer Guide .

              type -> (string)
                 The type of placement strategy. The random placement strategy
                 randomly  places  tasks  on  available candidates. The spread
                 placement strategy spreads placement across available  candi-
                 dates evenly based on the field parameter. The binpack strat-
                 egy places tasks on available candidates that have the  least
                 available  amount  of  the resource that's specified with the
                 field parameter. For example, if you  binpack  on  memory,  a
                 task  is  placed on the instance with the least amount of re-
                 maining memory but still enough to run the task.

              field -> (string)
                 The field to apply the placement strategy  against.  For  the
                 spread  placement  strategy,  valid values are instanceId (or
                 host , which has the same effect), or any platform or  custom
                 attribute that's applied to a container instance, such as at-
                 tribute:ecs.availability-zone .  For  the  binpack  placement
                 strategy,  valid  values  are cpu and memory . For the random
                 placement strategy, this field is not used.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          type=string,field=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "type": "random"|"spread"|"binpack",
              "field": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --platform-version (string)
          The platform version the task uses. A platform version is only spec-
          ified  for tasks hosted on Fargate. If one isn't specified, the LAT-
          EST platform version is used.  For  more  information,  see  Fargate
          platform  versions in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer
          Guide .

       --propagate-tags (string)
          Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the task definition  to
          the task. If no value is specified, the tags aren't propagated. Tags
          can only be propagated to the task during task creation. To add tags
          to a task after task creation, use the  TagResource API action.

          NOTE:
              An error will be received if you specify the SERVICE option when
              running a task.

          Possible values:

          o TASK_DEFINITION

          o SERVICE

          o NONE

       --reference-id (string)
          The reference ID to use for the task. The reference ID  can  have  a
          maximum length of 1024 characters.

       --started-by (string)
          An  optional  tag  specified when a task is started. For example, if
          you automatically trigger a task to run a  batch  process  job,  you
          could  apply  a unique identifier for that job to your task with the
          startedBy parameter. You can then identify  which  tasks  belong  to
          that  job  by  filtering  the  results of a  ListTasks call with the
          startedBy value. Up to 36 letters (uppercase  and  lowercase),  num-
          bers, hyphens (-), and underscores (_) are allowed.

          If  a  task  is started by an Amazon ECS service, then the startedBy
          parameter contains the deployment ID of the service that starts it.

       --tags (list)
          The metadata that you apply to the task to help you  categorize  and
          organize  them.  Each  tag  consists of a key and an optional value,
          both of which you define.

          The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

          o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

          o For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each  tag  key
            can have only one value.

          o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

          o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

          o If  your  tagging  schema is used across multiple services and re-
            sources, remember that other services may have restrictions on al-
            lowed  characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, num-
            bers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following charac-
            ters: + - = . _ : / @.

          o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

          o Do  not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination of
            such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is  reserved  for
            Amazon  Web  Services  use.  You cannot edit or delete tag keys or
            values with this prefix.  Tags  with  this  prefix  do  not  count
            against your tags per resource limit.

          (structure)
              The metadata that you apply to a resource to help you categorize
              and organize them. Each tag consists of a key  and  an  optional
              value. You define them.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

              o For  each  resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o If your tagging schema is used across  multiple  services  and
                resources,  remember that other services may have restrictions
                on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are:  let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
                lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.

              o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

              o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination
                of  such  as  a  prefix for either keys or values as it is re-
                served for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or  delete
                tag  keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do
                not count against your tags per resource limit.

              key -> (string)
                 One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key  is  a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              value -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a  tag.  A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --task-definition (string)
          The  family  and revision (family:revision ) or full ARN of the task
          definition to run. If a revision isn't specified, the latest  ACTIVE
          revision is used.

          When you create an IAM policy for run-task, you can set the resource
          to be the latest task definition revision, or a specific revision.

          The full ARN value must match the value that you  specified  as  the
          Resource of the IAM principal's permissions policy.

          When  you  specify the policy resource as the latest task definition
          version   (by   setting   the   Resource   in    the    policy    to
          arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:111122223333:task-definition/TaskFamilyName ),
          then set this value to arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:111122223333:task-defi-
          nition/TaskFamilyName .

          When  you  specify the policy resource as a specific task definition
          version   (by   setting   the   Resource   in    the    policy    to
          arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:111122223333:task-definition/TaskFamilyName:1
          or    arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:111122223333:task-definition/TaskFamily-
          Name:*       ),       then       set       this       value       to
          arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:111122223333:task-definition/TaskFamilyName:1
          .

          For  more  information,  see  Policy Resources for Amazon ECS in the
          Amazon Elastic Container Service developer Guide.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                 of  the  essential  containers  in the task. If all essential
                 containers in the task are reporting as HEALTHY  ,  the  task
                 status  also reports as HEALTHY . If any essential containers
                 in the task are reporting as UNHEALTHY or UNKNOWN , the  task
                 status also reports as UNHEALTHY or UNKNOWN .

                 NOTE:
                     The  Amazon ECS container agent doesn't monitor or report
                     on Docker health checks that are embedded in a  container
                     image  and not specified in the container definition. For
                     example, this includes those specified in a parent  image
                     or  from  the image's Dockerfile. Health check parameters
                     that are specified in a container definition override any
                     Docker  health checks that are found in the container im-

                     deviceName -> (string)
                        The Elastic Inference accelerator device name. The de-
                        viceName  must also be referenced in a container defi-
                        nition as a  ResourceRequirement .

                     deviceType -> (string)
                        The Elastic Inference accelerator type to use.

              lastStatus -> (string)
                 The last known status for the task. For more information, see
                 Task Lifecycle .

              launchType -> (string)
                 The infrastructure where your task runs on. For more informa-
                 tion, see Amazon ECS launch types in the Amazon Elastic  Con-
                 tainer Service Developer Guide .

              memory -> (string)
                 The amount of memory (in MiB) that the task uses as expressed
                 in a task definition. It can be expressed as an integer using
                 MiB (for example, 1024 ). If it's expressed as a string using
                 GB (for example, 1GB or 1 GB ), it's converted to an  integer
                 indicating the MiB when the task definition is registered.

                 If you use the EC2 launch type, this field is optional.

                 If  you  use the Fargate launch type, this field is required.
                 You must use one of the following values. The value that  you
                 choose  determines  the range of supported values for the cpu
                 parameter.

                 o 512 (0.5 GB), 1024 (1 GB), 2048 (2 GB) - Available cpu val-
                   ues: 256 (.25 vCPU)

                 o 1024 (1 GB), 2048 (2 GB), 3072 (3 GB), 4096 (4 GB) - Avail-
                   able cpu values: 512 (.5 vCPU)

                   GB),  7168 (7 GB), 8192 (8 GB) - Available cpu values: 1024
                   (1 vCPU)

                 o Between 4096 (4 GB) and 16384 (16 GB) in increments of 1024
                   (1 GB) - Available cpu values: 2048 (2 vCPU)

                 o Between 8192 (8 GB) and 30720 (30 GB) in increments of 1024
                   (1 GB) - Available cpu values: 4096 (4 vCPU)

                 One or more container overrides.

                 containerOverrides -> (list)
                     One or more container overrides that are sent to a task.

                     (structure)
                        The overrides that are sent to a container.  An  empty
                        container  override can be passed in. An example of an
                        empty container override is {"containerOverrides": [ ]
                        }  .  If  a non-empty container override is specified,
                        the name parameter must be included.

                        name -> (string)
                            The name of the container that receives the  over-
                            ride.  This  parameter is required if any override
                            is specified.

                        command -> (list)
                            The command to send to the  container  that  over-
                            rides the default command from the Docker image or
                            the task definition. You must also specify a  con-
                            tainer name.

                            (string)

                            The  environment  variables  to  send  to the con-
                            tainer. You can  add  new  environment  variables,
                            which are added to the container at launch, or you
                            can override the  existing  environment  variables
                            from  the Docker image or the task definition. You
                            must also specify a container name.

                            (structure)

                                   The name of the key-value pair.  For  envi-
                                   ronment  variables, this is the name of the
                                   environment variable.

                               value -> (string)
                                   The value of the key-value pair. For  envi-
                                   ronment variables, this is the value of the
                                   environment variable.

                        environmentFiles -> (list)
                            A list of files containing the  environment  vari-
                            ables to pass to a container, instead of the value
                            from the container definition.

                            (structure)
                               A list  of  files  containing  the  environment
                               variables to pass to a container. You can spec-
                               ify up to ten environment files. The file  must
                               have a .env file extension. Each line in an en-
                               vironment file should  contain  an  environment
                               variable in VARIABLE=VALUE format. Lines begin-
                               ning with # are treated as comments and are ig-
                               nored.  For more information about the environ-
                               ment variable file syntax, see Declare  default
                               environment variables in file .

                               If  there  are  environment variables specified
                               using the environment parameter in a  container
                               definition, they take precedence over the vari-
                               ables contained within an environment file.  If
                               multiple  environment  files are specified that
                               contain the same  variable,  they're  processed
                               from  the  top  down. We recommend that you use
                               unique variable names.  For  more  information,
                               see  Specifying  environment  variables  in the
                               Amazon  Elastic  Container  Service   Developer

                            definition. You  must  also  specify  a  container
                            name.

                        memory -> (integer)
                            The  hard  limit  (in MiB) of memory to present to

                            the task definition. If your container attempts to
                            exceed the memory specified here, the container is
                            killed. You must also specify a container name.

                        memoryReservation -> (integer)

                            container,  instead  of the default value from the
                            task definition. The only supported resource is  a
                            GPU.

                                   The value for the specified resource type.

                                   If  the  GPU type is used, the value is the
                                   number of physical GPUs the Amazon ECS con-
                                   tainer  agent  reserves  for the container.
                                   The number of GPUs that's reserved for  all

                                   ber of available GPUs on the container  in-
                                   stance that the task is launched on.

                                   If  the  InferenceAccelerator type is used,
                                   the value matches  the  deviceName  for  an
                                   InferenceAccelerator  specified  in  a task
                                   definition.

              platformFamily -> (string)
                 The  operating system that your tasks are running on. A plat-
                 form family is specified only for tasks that use the  Fargate
                 launch type.

                 All  tasks that run as part of this service must use the same
                 platformFamily value as the service (for example, LINUX. ).

              startedBy -> (string)
                 The tag specified when a task is started. If  an  Amazon  ECS
                 service  started  the  task, the startedBy parameter contains
                 the deployment ID of that service.

              stopCode -> (string)
                 The stop code indicating why a task was stopped. The  stoppe-
                 dReason might contain additional details.

                 The following are valid values:

                 o TaskFailedToStart

                 o EssentialContainerExited

                 o UserInitiated

                 o TerminationNotice

                 o ServiceSchedulerInitiated

                 o SpotInterruption

              stoppedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  Unix  timestamp  for the time when the task was stopped.
                 More specifically, it's for the time when  the  task  transi-
                 tioned from the RUNNING state to the STOPPED state.

              stoppedReason -> (string)
                 The reason that the task was stopped.

              stoppingAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  Unix  timestamp  for  the time when the task stops. More
                 specifically, it's for the time  when  the  task  transitions
                 from the RUNNING state to STOPPED .

              tags -> (list)
                 The  metadata  that you apply to the task to help you catego-
                 rize and organize the task. Each tag consists of a key and an
                 optional value. You define both the key and value.

                 The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                 o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                 o For  each  resource,  each tag key must be unique, and each
                   tag key can have only one value.

                 o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
                   resources,  remember  that other services may have restric-
                   tions on allowed characters. Generally  allowed  characters
                   are:  letters,  numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8,
                   and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.

                 o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                 o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combina-
                   tion of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is
                   reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You  cannot  edit  or
                   delete  tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this
                   prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.

                 (structure)
                     The metadata that you apply to a  resource  to  help  you
                     categorize  and organize them. Each tag consists of a key
                     and an optional value. You define them.

                     The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                     o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                     o For each resource, each tag key  must  be  unique,  and
                       each tag key can have only one value.

                     o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                     o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                     o If your tagging schema is used across multiple services
                       and resources, remember that other  services  may  have
                       restrictions  on  allowed characters. Generally allowed
                       characters are: letters,  numbers,  and  spaces  repre-
                       sentable  in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - =
                       . _ : / @.

                     o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                     o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase com-
                       bination  of such as a prefix for either keys or values
                       as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You can-
                       not edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix.
                       Tags with this prefix do not count  against  your  tags
                       per resource limit.

                     key -> (string)
                        One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key
                        is a general label that acts like a category for  more
                        specific tag values.

                     value -> (string)
                        The  optional  part of a key-value pair that make up a
                        tag. A value acts as a descriptor within a  tag  cate-
                        gory (key).

              taskArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task.

              taskDefinitionArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the task definition that creates the task.

              version -> (long)
                 The  version  counter for the task. Every time a task experi-
                 ences a change that starts a CloudWatch  event,  the  version
                 counter is incremented. If you replicate your Amazon ECS task
                 state with CloudWatch Events, you can compare the version  of
                 a  task  reported by the Amazon ECS API actions with the ver-
                 sion reported in CloudWatch Events for the task  (inside  the
                 detail  object)  to  verify  that  the  version in your event
                 stream is current.

              ephemeralStorage -> (structure)
                 The ephemeral storage settings for the task.

                 sizeInGiB -> (integer)
                     The total amount, in GiB, of ephemeral storage to set for
                     the  task.  The minimum supported value is 21 GiB and the
                     maximum supported value is 200 GiB.

       failures -> (list)
          Any failures associated with the call.

          (structure)
              A failed resource. For a list of common causes, see API  failure
              reasons  in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide
              .

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the failed resource.

              reason -> (string)
                 The reason for the failure.

              detail -> (string)
                 The details of the failure.



                                                                    RUN-TASK()
