OPTIONS
       --catalog (string)
          Specifies the catalog related to the request. Valid values are:

          o AWS: Retrieves the snapshot job from the production  AWS  environ-
            ment.

          o Sandbox:  Retrieves  the  snapshot  job from a sandbox environment
            used for testing or development purposes.

       --resource-snapshot-job-identifier (string)
          The unique identifier of the resource snapshot job to be  retrieved.
          This identifier is crucial for pinpointing the specific job you want
          to query.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

          across AWS services.

       Catalog -> (string)
          The catalog in which the snapshot job was created. This  will  match
          the catalog specified in the request.

       CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The  date  and  time  when the snapshot job was created, in ISO 8601
          format (UTC). Example: "2023-05-01T20:37:46Z"

       EngagementId -> (string)

          This links the job to a specific engagement context.

       Id -> (string)
          The  unique  identifier  of  the  snapshot job. This matches the Re-
          sourceSnapshotJobIdentifier provided in the request.

       LastFailure -> (string)
          If the job has encountered any failures, this field contains the er-
          ror  message  from  the  most recent failure. This can be useful for
          troubleshooting issues with the job.

       LastSuccessfulExecutionDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time of the last successful execution of  the  job,  in
          ISO 8601 format (UTC). Example: "2023-05-01T20:37:46Z"

       ResourceArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the resource being snapshotted.
          This provides a globally unique identifier for the  resource  across
          AWS.

       ResourceId -> (string)
          The  identifier of the specific resource being snapshotted. The for-
          mat may vary depending on the ResourceType .

       ResourceSnapshotTemplateName -> (string)
          The name of the template used for creating the snapshot. This is the
          same  as  the template name. It defines the structure and content of
          the snapshot.

       ResourceType -> (string)
          The type of resource being snapshotted. This would have  Opportunity
          as a value as it is dependent on the supported resource type.

       Status -> (string)
          The current status of the snapshot job. Valid values:

          o STOPPED: The job is not currently running.

          o RUNNING: The job is actively executing.
