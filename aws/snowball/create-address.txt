NAME
       create-address -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an address for a Snow device to be shipped to. In most regions,
       addresses are validated at the time of creation. The address  you  pro-
       vide must be located within the serviceable area of your region. If the
       address is invalid or unsupported, then an exception is thrown.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AddressId=string,Name=string,Company=string,Street1=string,Street2=string,Street3=string,City=string,StateOrProvince=string,PrefectureOrDistrict=string,Landmark=string,Country=string,PostalCode=string,PhoneNumber=string,IsRestricted=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AddressId": "string",
            "Name": "string",
            "Company": "string",
            "Street1": "string",
            "Street2": "string",
            "Street3": "string",
            "City": "string",
            "StateOrProvince": "string",
            "PrefectureOrDistrict": "string",
            "Landmark": "string",
            "Country": "string",
            "PostalCode": "string",
            "PhoneNumber": "string",
            "IsRestricted": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AddressId -> (string)
          The  automatically  generated  ID for a specific address. You'll use
          this ID when you create a job to specify which address you want  the
          Snow device for that job shipped to.
