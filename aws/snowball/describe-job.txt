OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The  automatically   generated   ID   for   a   job,   for   example
          JID123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000 .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the

                 o In  Australia,  you  have access to express shipping. Typi-
                   cally, Snow devices shipped express are delivered in  about
                   a day.

                   shipping. Typically, Snow devices shipped express  are  de-
                   livered  in about a day. In addition, most countries in the
                   EU have access to standard shipping, which typically  takes
                   less than a week, one way.

                 o In India, Snow devices are delivered in one to seven days.

                       delivered  in  about a day. In addition, most countries
                       in the EU have access to standard shipping, which typi-
                       cally takes less than a week, one way.

                     o In  India,  Snow  devices are delivered in one to seven
                       days.

                     o In the United States of America (US), you  have  access
