NAME
       update-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       While  a  cluster's  ClusterState value is in the AwaitingQuorum state,
       you can update some of the information associated with a cluster.  Once
       the  cluster changes to a different job state, usually 60 minutes after
       the cluster being created, this action is no longer available.

                 identifying the AMI in both the Amazon Web Services Cloud and
