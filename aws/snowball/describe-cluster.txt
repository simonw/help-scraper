NAME
       describe-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about a specific cluster including shipping infor-
       mation, cluster status, and other important metadata.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-cluster
          --cluster-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-id (string)
          The automatically generated ID for a cluster.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                devices shipped express are delivered in about a day.

              o In the European Union (EU), you have access to  express  ship-
                ping. Typically, Snow devices shipped express are delivered in
                about a day. In addition, most countries in the EU have access
                to  standard shipping, which typically takes less than a week,
                one way.

              o In India, Snow devices are delivered in one to seven days.

              o In the US, you have access to  one-day  shipping  and  two-day
                shipping.
