GET-JOB-MANIFEST()                                          GET-JOB-MANIFEST()



NAME
       get-job-manifest -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a link to an Amazon S3 presigned URL for the manifest file as-
       sociated with the specified JobId value. You can  access  the  manifest
       file  for  up to 60 minutes after this request has been made. To access
       the manifest file after 60 minutes have passed, you'll have to make an-
       other call to the GetJobManifest action.

       The  manifest is an encrypted file that you can download after your job
       enters the WithCustomer status. The manifest is decrypted by using  the
       UnlockCode  code  value,  when  you pass both values to the Snow device
       through the Snowball client when the client is started  for  the  first
       time.

       As  a  best practice, we recommend that you don't save a copy of an Un-
       lockCode value in the same location as the manifest file for that  job.
       Saving these separately helps prevent unauthorized parties from gaining
       access to the Snow device associated with that job.

       The credentials of a given job, including its manifest file and  unlock
       code, expire 360 days after the job is created.

SYNOPSIS
            get-job-manifest
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The ID for a job that you want to get the manifest file for, for ex-
          ample JID123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000 .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ManifestURI -> (string)
          The Amazon S3 presigned URL for the manifest  file  associated  with
          the specified JobId value.
