NAME
       create-long-term-pricing -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  job  with  the  long-term  usage  option  for a device. The
       long-term usage is a 1-year or 3-year long-term pricing  type  for  the
       device.  You  are billed upfront, and Amazon Web Services provides dis-
       counts for long-term pricing.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-long-term-pricing
          --long-term-pricing-type <value>
          [--is-long-term-pricing-auto-renew | --no-is-long-term-pricing-auto-renew]
          [--snowball-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --long-term-pricing-type (string)
          The type of long-term pricing option you want for the device, either
          1-year or 3-year long-term pricing.

          Possible values:

          o OneYear

          o ThreeYear

       --is-long-term-pricing-auto-renew  | --no-is-long-term-pricing-auto-re-
       new (boolean)
          Specifies whether the current long-term pricing type for the  device
          should be renewed.

       --snowball-type (string)
          The  type  of  Snow  Family Devices to use for the long-term pricing
          job.

          Possible values:

          o STANDARD

          o EDGE

          o EDGE_C

          o EDGE_CG

          o EDGE_S

          o SNC1_HDD

          o SNC1_SSD

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LongTermPricingId -> (string)
          The ID of the long-term pricing type for the device.
