LIST-JOBS()                                                        LIST-JOBS()



NAME
       list-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  an array of JobListEntry objects of the specified length. Each
       JobListEntry object contains a job's state, a job's  ID,  and  a  value
       that  indicates  whether  the  job is a job part, in the case of export
       jobs. Calling this API action in one of the US regions will return jobs
       from  the  list  of all jobs associated with this account in all US re-
       gions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation by providing the --no-paginate argument.   When  using  --output
       text  and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query ar-
       gument must extract data from the results of the  following  query  ex-
       pressions: JobListEntries

SYNOPSIS
            list-jobs
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the current Snowball jobs in your account

       The following list-jobs example displays an array of  JobListEntry  ob-
       jects. In this example, a single job is listed.

          aws snowball list-jobs

       Output:

          {
              "JobListEntries": [
                  {
                      "CreationDate": 2016-09-27T14:50Z,
                       "Description": "Important Photos 2016-08-11",
                       "IsMaster": TRUE,
                       "JobId": "ABCd1e324fe-022f-488e-a98b-3b0566063db1",
                       "JobState": "Complete",
                       "JobType": "IMPORT",
                       "SnowballType": "EDGE"
                  }
             ]
          }

OUTPUT
       JobListEntries -> (list)
          Each JobListEntry object contains a job's state, a job's ID,  and  a
          value  that  indicates whether the job is a job part, in the case of
          export jobs.

          (structure)
              Each JobListEntry object contains a job's state, a job's ID, and
              a  value  that  indicates  whether the job is a job part, in the
              case of an export job.

              JobId -> (string)
                 The  automatically  generated  ID  for  a  job,  for  example
                 JID123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000 .

              JobState -> (string)
                 The current state of this job.

              IsMaster -> (boolean)
                 A  value  that  indicates that this job is a main job. A main
                 job represents a successful request to create an export  job.
                 Main jobs aren't associated with any Snowballs. Instead, each
                 main job will have at least one job part, and each  job  part
                 is associated with a Snowball. It might take some time before
                 the job parts associated  with  a  particular  main  job  are
                 listed,  because  they are created after the main job is cre-
                 ated.

              JobType -> (string)
                 The type of job.

              SnowballType -> (string)
                 The type of device used with this job.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The creation date for this job.

              Description -> (string)
                 The optional description of this specific  job,  for  example
                 Important Photos 2016-08-11 .

       NextToken -> (string)
          HTTP requests are stateless. If you use this automatically generated
          NextToken value in your next ListJobs call, your returned JobListEn-
          try objects will start from this point in the array.
