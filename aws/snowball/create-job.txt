CREATE-JOB()                                                      CREATE-JOB()



NAME
       create-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  job  to  import  or  export data between Amazon S3 and your
       on-premises data center. Your Amazon Web Services account must have the
       right  trust  policies  and  permissions in place to create a job for a
       Snow device. If you're creating a job for a node in a cluster, you only
       need  to  provide the clusterId value; the other job attributes are in-
       herited from the cluster.

       NOTE:
              Only the Snowball; Edge device type is supported  when  ordering
              clustered jobs.

              The device capacity is optional.

              Availability  of  device types differ by Amazon Web Services Re-
              gion. For more information about Region availability, see Amazon
              Web Services Regional Services .

          With IMPORT jobs, you specify the bucket or buckets that your trans-
          ferred data will be imported into.

          With EXPORT jobs, you specify the bucket or buckets that your trans-
          ferred  data will be exported from. Optionally, you can also specify
          a KeyRange value. If you choose to export a range,  you  define  the
          length  of  the  range  by providing either an inclusive BeginMarker
          value, an inclusive EndMarker value, or both. Ranges are  UTF-8  bi-
          nary sorted.

                 your transferred data will be exported from or imported into.
                 For  export  jobs,  this object can have an optional KeyRange
                 value. The length of the range is defined  at  job  creation,
                 and  has  either an inclusive BeginMarker , an inclusive End-

                     within  a  specific  Amazon  S3 bucket. The length of the
                     range is defined at job creation, and has either  an  in-
                     clusive  BeginMarker  , an inclusive EndMarker , or both.

       --remote-management (string)

          TOSTART , remote management will automatically be available when the
          device  arrives  at  your  location.  Otherwise, you need to use the
          Snowball Client to manage the device.

          o INSTALLED_ONLY

          o INSTALLED_AUTOSTART

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON

       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
