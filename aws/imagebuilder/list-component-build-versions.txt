LIST-COMPONENT-BUILD-VERSIONS()                LIST-COMPONENT-BUILD-VERSIONS()



NAME
       list-component-build-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the list of component build versions for the specified semantic
       version.

       NOTE:
          The    semantic    version    has    four    nodes:     <major>.<mi-
          nor>.<patch>/<build>. You can assign values for the first three, and
          can filter on all of them.
              Filtering: With semantic versioning, you have the flexibility to
              use  wildcards  (x) to specify the most recent versions or nodes
              when selecting the base image or  components  for  your  recipe.
              When  you  use a wildcard in any node, all nodes to the right of
              the first wildcard must also be wildcards.

SYNOPSIS
            list-component-build-versions
          --component-version-arn <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --component-version-arn (string)
          The component version Amazon Resource Name (ARN) whose versions  you
          want to list.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum items to return in a request.

       --next-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list component build versions

       The following list-component-build-versions example lists the component
       build versions with a specific semantic version.

          aws imagebuilder list-component-build-versions --component-version-arn arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:component/myexamplecomponent/2019.12.02

       Output:

OUTPUT
       requestId -> (string)
          The request ID that uniquely identifies this request.

          The list of component summaries for the specified semantic version.

          (structure)
              A high-level summary of a component.
