GET-IMAGE-PIPELINE()                                      GET-IMAGE-PIPELINE()



NAME
       get-image-pipeline -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets an image pipeline.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-image-pipeline
          --image-pipeline-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --image-pipeline-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the image pipeline that you want
          to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get image pipeline details

       The  following get-image-pipeline example lists the details of an image
       pipeline by specifying its ARN.

OUTPUT
       requestId -> (string)
          The request ID that uniquely identifies this request.

       imagePipeline -> (structure)
          The image pipeline object.

          arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the image pipeline.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the image pipeline.

          description -> (string)
              The description of the image pipeline.

          platform -> (string)
              The platform of the image pipeline.

          enhancedImageMetadataEnabled -> (boolean)
              Collects  additional  information about the image being created,
              including the operating system (OS) version  and  package  list.
              This  information  is  used to enhance the overall experience of
              using EC2 Image Builder. Enabled by default.

          imageRecipeArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  image  recipe  associated
              with this image pipeline.

          containerRecipeArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the container recipe that is
              used for this pipeline.

          infrastructureConfigurationArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the infrastructure  configura-
              tion associated with this image pipeline.

          distributionConfigurationArn -> (string)

              associated with this image pipeline.

          imageTestsConfiguration -> (structure)
              The image tests configuration of the image pipeline.

              imageTestsEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Determines if tests should run after building the image.  Im-
                 age Builder defaults to enable tests to run following the im-
                 age build, before image distribution.

              timeoutMinutes -> (integer)
                 The maximum time in minutes that tests are permitted to run.

          schedule -> (structure)
              The schedule of the image pipeline.

              scheduleExpression -> (string)
                 The cron expression determines how often  EC2  Image  Builder
                 evaluates your pipelineExecutionStartCondition .

                 For  information  on how to format a cron expression in Image
                 Builder, see Use cron expressions in EC2 Image Builder .

              timezone -> (string)
                 The timezone that applies to the scheduling  expression.  For
                 example,  "Etc/UTC",  "America/Los_Angeles" in the IANA time-
                 zone format . If not specified this defaults to UTC.

              pipelineExecutionStartCondition -> (string)
                 The condition configures when the pipeline should  trigger  a
                 new  image build. When the pipelineExecutionStartCondition is
                 set  to  EXPRESSION_MATCH_AND_DEPENDENCY_UPDATES_AVAILABLE  ,
                 and  you  use  semantic  version filters on the base image or
                 components in your image recipe, EC2 Image Builder will build
                 a  new image only when there are new versions of the image or
                 components in your recipe that  match  the  semantic  version
                 filter.  When  it  is  set to EXPRESSION_MATCH_ONLY , it will
                 build a new image every time the CRON expression matches  the
                 current    time.    For    semantic   version   syntax,   see
                 CreateComponent in the EC2 Image Builder API Reference .

              The date on which this image pipeline was created.

          dateUpdated -> (string)
              The date on which this image pipeline was last updated.

          dateLastRun -> (string)
              The date on which this image pipeline was last run.
