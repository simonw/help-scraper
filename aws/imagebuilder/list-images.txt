DESCRIPTION
       Returns the list of images that you have access to.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-images
          [--owner <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--by-name | --no-by-name]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--include-deprecated | --no-include-deprecated]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --owner (string)
          The  owner  defines  which images you want to list. By default, this
          request will only show images owned by your  account.  You  can  use
          this  field to specify if you want to view images owned by yourself,
          by Amazon, or those images that have been shared with you  by  other
          customers.

          Possible values:

          o Self

          o Shared

          o Amazon

       --filters (list)
          Use the following filters to streamline results:

          o name

          o osVersion

          o platform

          o type

          o version

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a list operation. Filters can be used
              to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags,
              attributes, or IDs.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --by-name | --no-by-name (boolean)
          Requests a list of images with a specific recipe name.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum items to return in a request.

       --next-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

       --include-deprecated | --no-include-deprecated (boolean)
          Includes deprecated images in the response list.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       requestId -> (string)
          The request ID that uniquely identifies this request.

       imageVersionList -> (list)
          The list of image semantic versions.

          NOTE:
              The    semantic    version    has   four   nodes:   <major>.<mi-
              nor>.<patch>/<build>. You can assign values for the first three,
              and can filter on all of them.
                 Filtering: With semantic versioning, you have the flexibility
                 to use wildcards (x) to specify the most recent  versions  or
                 nodes  when  selecting  the base image or components for your
                 recipe. When you use a wildcard in any node, all nodes to the
                 right of the first wildcard must also be wildcards.

          (structure)
              The  defining  characteristics of a specific version of an Image
              Builder image.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a specific  version  of  an
                 Image Builder image.

                 NOTE:
                     Semantic  versioning  is included in each object's Amazon
                     Resource Name (ARN), at the level that  applies  to  that
                     object as follows:

                     o Versionless  ARNs and Name ARNs do not include specific
                       values in any of the nodes. The nodes are  either  left
                       off  entirely,  or they are specified as wildcards, for
                       example: x.x.x.

                     o Version ARNs have only  the  first  three  nodes:  <ma-
                       jor>.<minor>.<patch>

                     o Build  version ARNs have all four nodes, and point to a
                       specific build for a specific version of an object.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of this specific version of an Image Builder image.

              type -> (string)
                 Specifies whether this image is an AMI or a container image.

              version -> (string)
                 Details for a specific version of  an  Image  Builder  image.
                 This version follows the semantic version syntax.

                 NOTE:
                     The   semantic   version  has  four  nodes:  <major>.<mi-
                     nor>.<patch>/<build>. You can assign values for the first
                     three, and can filter on all of them.
                        Assignment:  For  the first three nodes you can assign
                        any positive integer value, including  zero,  with  an
                        upper  limit  of  2^30-1, or 1073741823 for each node.
                        Image Builder automatically assigns the  build  number
                        to the fourth node.

                        Patterns: You can use any numeric pattern that adheres
                        to the assignment requirements for the nodes that  you
                        can  assign.  For example, you might choose a software
                        version pattern, such as 1.0.0, or  a  date,  such  as
                        2021.01.01.

                        Filtering:  With  semantic  versioning,  you  have the
                        flexibility to use wildcards (x) to specify  the  most
                        recent versions or nodes when selecting the base image
                        or components for your recipe. When you use a wildcard
                        in any node, all nodes to the right of the first wild-
                        card must also be wildcards.

              platform -> (string)
                 The platform of the image version, for example  "Windows"  or
                 "Linux".

              osVersion -> (string)
                 The  operating  system  version  of  the Amazon EC2 build in-
                 stance. For example, Amazon Linux 2, Ubuntu 18, or  Microsoft
                 Windows Server 2019.

              owner -> (string)
                 The owner of the image version.

              dateCreated -> (string)
                 The  date on which this specific version of the Image Builder
                 image was created.

              buildType -> (string)
                 Indicates the type of build  that  created  this  image.  The
                 build can be initiated in the following ways:

                 o USER_INITIATED  A manual pipeline build request.

                 o SCHEDULED   A pipeline build initiated by a cron expression
                   in the Image Builder pipeline, or from EventBridge.

                 o IMPORT  A VM import created the image to use  as  the  base
                   image for the recipe.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The next token used for paginated responses. When this is not empty,
          there are additional elements that the service has not  included  in
          this request. Use this token with the next request to retrieve addi-
          tional objects.
