CREATE-IMAGE()                                                  CREATE-IMAGE()



NAME
       create-image -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new  image. This request will create a new image along with
       all of the configured output resources defined in the distribution con-
       figuration.  You  must specify exactly one recipe for your image, using
       either a ContainerRecipeArn or an ImageRecipeArn.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

            create-image

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --image-recipe-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the image recipe that defines  how
          images are configured, tested, and assessed.

       --container-recipe-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the container recipe that defines
          how images are configured and tested.

       --distribution-configuration-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  distribution  configuration
          that defines and configures the outputs of your pipeline.

       --infrastructure-configuration-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the infrastructure configuration
          that defines the environment in which your image will be  built  and
          tested.

       --image-tests-configuration (structure)
          The image tests configuration of the image.

          imageTestsEnabled -> (boolean)
              Determines  if  tests should run after building the image. Image
              Builder defaults to enable tests  to  run  following  the  image
              build, before image distribution.

          timeoutMinutes -> (integer)
              The maximum time in minutes that tests are permitted to run.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          imageTestsEnabled=boolean,timeoutMinutes=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "imageTestsEnabled": true|false,
            "timeoutMinutes": integer
          }

       --enhanced-image-metadata-enabled   |  --no-enhanced-image-metadata-en-
       abled (boolean)
          Collects additional information about the image being  created,  in-
          cluding the operating system (OS) version and package list. This in-
          formation is used to enhance the overall experience of using EC2 Im-
          age Builder. Enabled by default.

       --tags (map)
          The tags of the image.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --client-token (string)
          The idempotency token used to make this request idempotent.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create an image

       The following create-image example creates an image.

          aws imagebuilder create-image \
              --image-recipe-arn arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:image-recipe/mybasicrecipe/2019.12.03 \
              --infrastructure-configuration-arn arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:infrastructure-configuration/myexampleinfrastructure

       Output:

          {
              "requestId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
              "clientToken": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",
              "imageBuildVersionArn": "arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:image/mybasicrecipe/2019.12.03/1"
          }

       Image Pipeline Using the AWS CLI in the EC2 Image Builder Users Guide.

OUTPUT
       requestId -> (string)
          The request ID that uniquely identifies this request.

       clientToken -> (string)
          The idempotency token used to make this request idempotent.

       imageBuildVersionArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the image that was created by this
          request.
