NAME
       create-infrastructure-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new infrastructure configuration. An infrastructure configu-
       ration defines the environment in which your image will  be  built  and
       tested.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the infrastructure configuration.

       --description (string)
          The description of the infrastructure configuration.

       --instance-types (list)
          The  instance  types  of  the  infrastructure configuration. You can
          specify one or more instance types to use for this build.  The  ser-
          vice will pick one of these instance types based on availability.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --instance-profile-name (string)
          The  instance profile to associate with the instance used to custom-
          ize your Amazon EC2 AMI.

       --security-group-ids (list)
          The security group IDs to associate with the instance used  to  cus-
          tomize your Amazon EC2 AMI.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --subnet-id (string)
          The  subnet ID in which to place the instance used to customize your
          Amazon EC2 AMI.

       --logging (structure)
          The logging configuration of the infrastructure configuration.

          s3Logs -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 logging configuration.

              s3BucketName -> (string)
                 The S3 bucket in which to store the logs.

              s3KeyPrefix -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 path to the bucket where the logs are stored.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          s3Logs={s3BucketName=string,s3KeyPrefix=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "s3Logs": {
              "s3BucketName": "string",
              "s3KeyPrefix": "string"
            }
          }

       --key-pair (string)
          The key pair of the infrastructure configuration. You can  use  this
          to log on to and debug the instance used to create your image.

       --terminate-instance-on-failure   |  --no-terminate-instance-on-failure
       (boolean)
          The terminate instance on failure setting of the infrastructure con-
          figuration. Set to false if you want Image Builder to retain the in-
          stance used to configure your AMI if the build or test phase of your
          workflow fails.

       --sns-topic-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) for the SNS topic to which we send
          image build event notifications.

          NOTE:
              EC2 Image Builder is unable to send notifications to SNS  topics
              that  are encrypted using keys from other accounts. The key that
              is used to encrypt the SNS topic must reside in the account that
              the Image Builder service runs under.

       --resource-tags (map)
          The tags attached to the resource created by Image Builder.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --instance-metadata-options (structure)
          The instance metadata options that you can set for the HTTP requests
          that pipeline builds use to launch EC2 build and test instances.

          httpTokens -> (string)
              Indicates whether a signed token header is required for instance
              metadata  retrieval  requests. The values affect the response as
              follows:

              o required  When you retrieve the IAM role credentials,  version
                2.0 credentials are returned in all cases.

              o optional   You  can  include a signed token header in your re-
                quest to retrieve instance metadata, or you can leave it  out.
                If  you  include  it, version 2.0 credentials are returned for
                the IAM role. Otherwise, version 1.0 credentials are returned.

              The default setting is optional .

          httpPutResponseHopLimit -> (integer)
              Limit the number of hops that an instance metadata  request  can
              traverse to reach its destination.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          httpTokens=string,httpPutResponseHopLimit=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "httpTokens": "string",
            "httpPutResponseHopLimit": integer
          }

       --tags (map)
          The tags of the infrastructure configuration.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --client-token (string)
          The idempotency token used to make this request idempotent.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
