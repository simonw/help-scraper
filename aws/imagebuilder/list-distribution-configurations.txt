DESCRIPTION

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-distribution-configurations
          [--filters <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          You can filter on name to streamline results.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a list operation. Filters can be used
              to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags,
              attributes, or IDs.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum items to return in a request.

       --next-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          tional objects.
