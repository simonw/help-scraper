          that grants Image Builder access to run lifecycle actions.

       --resource-type (string)

          to.

          o AMI_IMAGE

          o CONTAINER_IMAGE

       --policy-details (list)
          Configuration details for the lifecycle policy rules.

          (structure)
              The configuration details for a lifecycle policy resource.

              action -> (structure)
                 Configuration details for the policy action.

                 type -> (string)
                     Specifies the lifecycle action to take.

                 includeResources -> (structure)
                     Specifies the resources that the lifecycle policy applies
                     to.

                     amis -> (boolean)
                        Specifies whether the lifecycle action should apply to
                        distributed AMIs.

                     snapshots -> (boolean)
                        Specifies whether the lifecycle action should apply to
                        snapshots associated with distributed AMIs.

                     containers -> (boolean)
                        Specifies whether the lifecycle action should apply to
                        distributed containers.

              filter -> (structure)
                 Specifies the resources that the lifecycle policy applies to.

                 type -> (string)
                     Filter resources based on either age or count .

                 value -> (integer)
                     The number of units for the time period or for the count.
                     For example, a value of 6 might refer to  six  months  or
                     six AMIs.

                     NOTE:
                        For  count-based  filters,  this  value represents the
                        minimum number of resources to keep on  hand.  If  you
                        have fewer resources than this number, the resource is
                        excluded from lifecycle actions.

                 unit -> (string)
                     Defines the unit of time that the lifecycle  policy  uses
                     to  determine  impacted  resources.  This is required for
                     age-based rules.

                 retainAtLeast -> (integer)
                     For age-based filters, this is the number of resources to
                     keep  on  hand  after  the lifecycle DELETE action is ap-
                     plied. Impacted resources are only deleted  if  you  have
                     more than this number of resources. If you have fewer re-
                     sources than this number, the impacted  resource  is  not
                     deleted.

              exclusionRules -> (structure)
                 Additional  rules  to specify resources that should be exempt
                 from policy actions.

                 tagMap -> (map)
                     Contains a list of tags that Image Builder uses  to  skip
                     lifecycle  actions for Image Builder image resources that
                     have them.

                     key -> (string)

                 amis -> (structure)
                     Lists configuration values that apply to AMIs that  Image
                     Builder should exclude from the lifecycle action.

                     isPublic -> (boolean)
                        Configures  whether  public AMIs are excluded from the
                        lifecycle action.

                     regions -> (list)
                        Configures Amazon Web Services Regions  that  are  ex-
                        cluded from the lifecycle action.

                        (string)

                        Specifies Amazon Web Services accounts whose resources
                        are excluded from the lifecycle action.

                        (string)

                     lastLaunched -> (structure)
                        Specifies configuration details for Image  Builder  to
                        exclude  the  most recent resources from lifecycle ac-
                        tions.

                        value -> (integer)
                            The integer number of units for the  time  period.
                            For example 6 (months).

                        unit -> (string)
                            Defines the unit of time that the lifecycle policy
                            uses to calculate elapsed time since the last  in-
                            stance  launched  from the AMI. For example: days,
                            weeks, months, or years.

                     tagMap -> (map)
                        Lists tags that should be excluded from lifecycle  ac-

          the Amazon EC2 API Reference .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not

       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)
