       create-image-recipe -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new image recipe. Image recipes define how images are config-
       ured, tested, and assessed.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-image-recipe
          --name <value>
          [--description <value>]
          --semantic-version <value>
          --components <value>
          --parent-image <value>
          [--block-device-mappings <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--working-directory <value>]
          [--additional-instance-configuration <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the image recipe.

       --description (string)
          The description of the image recipe.

       --semantic-version (string)
          The semantic version of the image recipe. This version  follows  the
          semantic version syntax.

          NOTE:
              The    semantic    version    has   four   nodes:   <major>.<mi-
              nor>.<patch>/<build>. You can assign values for the first three,
              and can filter on all of them.
                 Assignment: For the first three nodes you can assign any pos-
                 itive integer value, including zero, with an upper  limit  of
                 2^30-1,  or 1073741823 for each node. Image Builder automati-
                 cally assigns the build number to the fourth node.

                 Patterns: You can use any numeric pattern that adheres to the
                 assignment  requirements  for  the nodes that you can assign.
                 For example, you might choose  a  software  version  pattern,
                 such as 1.0.0, or a date, such as 2021.01.01.

                     Contains a key/value pair that sets the  named  component
                     parameter.

          specific  version that you want to use, or you can use a wildcard in
          all of the fields. If you enter an AMI ID for the string value,  you

              instance.

              uninstallAfterBuild -> (boolean)
                 Controls  whether  the  Systems Manager agent is removed from
                 your final build image, prior to creating  the  new  AMI.  If
                 this is set to true, then the agent is removed from the final
                 image. If it's set to false, then the agent is  left  in,  so
                 that  it  is  included  in  the new AMI. The default value is
                 false.

          userDataOverride -> (string)
              Use this property to provide commands or a command script to run
              when you launch your build instance.

              NOTE:
                 The  userDataOverride property replaces any commands that Im-
                 age Builder might have added to ensure that  Systems  Manager
                 is  installed  on  your Linux build instance. If you override
                 the user data, make sure that you  add  commands  to  install
                 Systems  Manager, if it is not pre-installed on your base im-
                 age.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          systemsManagerAgent={uninstallAfterBuild=boolean},userDataOverride=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "systemsManagerAgent": {
              "uninstallAfterBuild": true|false
            },
            "userDataOverride": "string"
          }

       --client-token (string)
          The idempotency token used to make this request idempotent.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
