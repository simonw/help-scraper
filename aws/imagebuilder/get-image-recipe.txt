NAME
       get-image-recipe -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets an image recipe.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-image-recipe
          --image-recipe-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --image-recipe-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the image recipe that you want to
          retrieve.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              flows.

          additionalInstanceConfiguration -> (structure)
              Before  you  create  a new AMI, Image Builder launches temporary
              Amazon EC2 instances to build and test your image configuration.
              Instance  configuration  adds  a layer of control over those in-
              stances. You can define settings and add scripts to run when  an
              instance is launched from your AMI.

              systemsManagerAgent -> (structure)
                 Contains settings for the Systems Manager agent on your build
                 instance.

                     Controls whether the Systems  Manager  agent  is  removed
                     from  your  final  build image, prior to creating the new
                     AMI. If this is set to true, then the  agent  is  removed
                     from  the  final  image.  If  it's set to false, then the
                     agent is left in, so that it is included in the new  AMI.
                     The default value is false.

              userDataOverride -> (string)
                 Use  this property to provide commands or a command script to
                 run when you launch your build instance.

                 NOTE:
                     The userDataOverride property replaces any commands  that
                     Image  Builder  might  have  added to ensure that Systems
                     Manager is installed on your Linux build instance. If you
                     override  the  user data, make sure that you add commands
                     to install Systems Manager, if it is not pre-installed on
                     your base image.
