OPTIONS
       --owner (string)
          Returns  container  recipes  belonging  to the specified owner, that
          have been shared with you. You can omit this field  to  return  con-
          tainer recipes belonging to your account.

          Possible values:

          o Self

          o Shared

          o Amazon

       --filters (list)
          Use the following filters to streamline results:

          o containerType

          o name

          o parentImage

          o platform

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a list operation. Filters can be used
              to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags,
              attributes, or IDs.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in the list.

       --next-token (string)
          Provides a token for pagination, which determines where to begin the
          next set of results when the current set reaches the maximum for one
          request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       requestId -> (string)
          The request ID that uniquely identifies this request.

       containerRecipeSummaryList -> (list)

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the container recipe.

              containerType -> (string)
                 Specifies the type of container, such as "Docker".

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the container recipe.

              platform -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          The next token field is used for paginated responses. When  this  is
          not  empty,  there are additional container recipes that the service
          has not included in this response. Use this token with the next  re-
          quest to retrieve additional list items.
