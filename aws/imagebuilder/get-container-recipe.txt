OPTIONS
       --container-recipe-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the container recipe to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       requestId -> (string)
          The request ID that uniquely identifies this request.

       containerRecipe -> (structure)
          The container recipe object that is returned.

          arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the container recipe.

              NOTE:
                 Semantic  versioning  is included in each object's Amazon Re-
                 source Name (ARN), at the level that applies to  that  object
                 as follows:

                 o Versionless ARNs and Name ARNs do not include specific val-
                   ues in any of the nodes. The nodes are either left off  en-
                   tirely,  or  they  are specified as wildcards, for example:
                   x.x.x.

                 o Version ARNs have only the first three nodes:  <major>.<mi-
                   nor>.<patch>

                 o Build version ARNs have all four nodes, and point to a spe-
                   cific build for a specific version of an object.

          containerType -> (string)
              Specifies the type of container, such as Docker.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the container recipe.

          description -> (string)
              The description of the container recipe.

          platform -> (string)
              The system platform for the container, such as Windows or Linux.

          owner -> (string)
              The owner of the container recipe.

          version -> (string)
              The semantic version of the container recipe.

              NOTE:
                 The   semantic   version   has   four   nodes:   <major>.<mi-
                 nor>.<patch>/<build>.  You  can  assign  values for the first
                 three, and can filter on all of them.
                     Assignment: For the first three nodes you can assign  any
                     positive  integer  value,  including  zero, with an upper
                     limit of 2^30-1,  or  1073741823  for  each  node.  Image
                     Builder  automatically  assigns  the  build number to the
                     fourth node.

                     Patterns: You can use any numeric pattern that adheres to
                     the  assignment  requirements  for the nodes that you can
                     assign. For example, you might choose a software  version
                     pattern, such as 1.0.0, or a date, such as 2021.01.01.

                     Filtering:  With semantic versioning, you have the flexi-
                     bility to use wildcards (x) to specify  the  most  recent
                     versions or nodes when selecting the base image or compo-
                     nents for your recipe. When you use  a  wildcard  in  any
                     node,  all  nodes to the right of the first wildcard must
                     also be wildcards.

          components -> (list)
              Build and test components that are  included  in  the  container
              recipe.  Recipes  require  a minimum of one build component, and
              can have a maximum of 20 build and test components in any combi-
              nation.
