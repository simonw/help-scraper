LIST-COMPONENTS()                                            LIST-COMPONENTS()



NAME
       list-components -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the list of component build versions for the specified semantic
       version.

       NOTE:
          The    semantic    version    has    four    nodes:     <major>.<mi-
          nor>.<patch>/<build>. You can assign values for the first three, and
          can filter on all of them.
              Filtering: With semantic versioning, you have the flexibility to
              use  wildcards  (x) to specify the most recent versions or nodes
              when selecting the base image or  components  for  your  recipe.
              When  you  use a wildcard in any node, all nodes to the right of
              the first wildcard must also be wildcards.

SYNOPSIS
            list-components
          [--owner <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--by-name | --no-by-name]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --owner (string)
          The owner defines which components you want  to  list.  By  default,
          this  request  will  only show components owned by your account. You
          can use this field to specify if you want to view  components  owned
          by  yourself,  by  Amazon, or those components that have been shared
          with you by other customers.

          Possible values:

          o Self

          o Shared

          o Amazon

       --filters (list)
          Use the following filters to streamline results:

          o description

          o name

          o platform

          o supportedOsVersion

          o type

          o version

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific list of results from a list operation. Filters can be used
              to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as  tags,
              attributes, or IDs.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --by-name | --no-by-name (boolean)
          Returns the list of component build versions for the specified name.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum items to return in a request.

       --next-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list all of the component semantic versions

       The following list-components example lists all of the component seman-
       tic versions to which you have access. You  can  optionally  filter  on
       whether  to  list components owned by you, by Amazon, or that have been
       shared with you by other accounts.

OUTPUT
       requestId -> (string)
          The request ID that uniquely identifies this request.

       componentVersionList -> (list)
          The list of component semantic versions.

          NOTE:
              The    semantic    version    has   four   nodes:   <major>.<mi-
              nor>.<patch>/<build>. You can assign values for the first three,
              and can filter on all of them.

          (structure)
              The  defining characteristics of a specific version of an Amazon
              Web Services TOE component.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the component.

                 NOTE:
                     Semantic versioning is included in each  object's  Amazon
                     Resource  Name  (ARN),  at the level that applies to that
                     object as follows:

                     o Versionless ARNs and Name ARNs do not include  specific
                       values  in  any of the nodes. The nodes are either left
                       off entirely, or they are specified as  wildcards,  for
                       example: x.x.x.

                     o Version  ARNs  have  only  the  first three nodes: <ma-
                       jor>.<minor>.<patch>

                     o Build version ARNs have all four nodes, and point to  a
                       specific build for a specific version of an object.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the component.

              version -> (string)
                 The semantic version of the component.

                 NOTE:
                     The   semantic   version  has  four  nodes:  <major>.<mi-
                     nor>.<patch>/<build>. You can assign values for the first
                     three, and can filter on all of them.
                        Assignment:  For  the first three nodes you can assign
                        any positive integer value, including  zero,  with  an
                        upper  limit  of  2^30-1, or 1073741823 for each node.
                        Image Builder automatically assigns the  build  number
                        to the fourth node.

                        Patterns: You can use any numeric pattern that adheres
                        to the assignment requirements for the nodes that  you
                        can  assign.  For example, you might choose a software
                        version pattern, such as 1.0.0, or  a  date,  such  as
                        2021.01.01.

                        Filtering:  With  semantic  versioning,  you  have the
                        flexibility to use wildcards (x) to specify  the  most
                        recent versions or nodes when selecting the base image
                        or components for your recipe. When you use a wildcard
                        in any node, all nodes to the right of the first wild-
                        card must also be wildcards.

              description -> (string)
                 The description of the component.

              platform -> (string)
                 The platform of the component.

              supportedOsVersions -> (list)
                 he operating system (OS) version supported by the  component.
                 If  the  OS  information is available, a prefix match is per-
                 formed against the base image OS version during image  recipe
                 creation.

                 (string)

              type -> (string)
                 The  type  of  the component denotes whether the component is
                 used to build the image or only to test it.

              owner -> (string)
                 The owner of the component.

              dateCreated -> (string)
                 The date that the component was created.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The next token used for paginated responses. When this is not empty,
          there  are  additional elements that the service has not included in
          this request. Use this token with the next request to retrieve addi-
          tional objects.
