GET-COMPONENT()                                                GET-COMPONENT()



NAME
       get-component -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a component object.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-component
          --component-build-version-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --component-build-version-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the component that you want to re-
          trieve. Regex requires "/d+$" suffix.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get component details

       The following get-component example lists the details of a component by
       specifying its ARN.

          aws imagebuilder get-component \
              --component-build-version-arn arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:component/component-name/1.0.0/1

       Output:

          {
              "requestId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
              "component": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:component/component-name/1.0.0/1",
                  "name": "component-name",
