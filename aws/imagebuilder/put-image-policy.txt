PUT-IMAGE-POLICY()                                          PUT-IMAGE-POLICY()



NAME
       put-image-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Applies  a  policy  to an image. We recommend that you call the RAM API
       CreateResourceShare to share resources. If you call the  Image  Builder
       API    PutImagePolicy    ,   you   must   also   call   the   RAM   API
       PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy in order for the resource  to  be
       visible to all principals with whom the resource is shared.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-image-policy
          --image-arn <value>
          --policy <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --image-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the image that this policy should
          be applied to.

       --policy (string)
          The policy to apply.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To apply a resource policy to an image

       The  following put-image-policy command applies a resource policy to an
       image to enable cross-account sharing of images. We recommend  you  use
       the  RAM  CLI  command  create-resource-share. If you use the EC2 Image
       Builder CLI command put-image-policy, you must also  use  the  RAM  CLI
       command  promote-resource-share-create-from-policy in order for the re-
       source to be visible to  all  principals  with  whom  the  resource  is
       shared.

          aws imagebuilder put-image-policy \
              --image-arn arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:image/example-image/2019.12.02/1 \
              --policy '{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Allow", "Principal": { "AWS": [ "123456789012" ] }, "Action": [ "imagebuilder:GetImage", "imagebuilder:ListImages" ], "Resource": [ "arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:image/example-image/2019.12.02/1" ] } ] }'

       Output:

          {
              "requestId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
              "imageArn": "arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:image/example-image/2019.12.02/1"
          }

          The request ID that uniquely identifies this request.
