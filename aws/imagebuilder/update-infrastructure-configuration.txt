NAME
       update-infrastructure-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  a new infrastructure configuration. An infrastructure configu-
       ration defines the environment in which your image will  be  built  and
       tested.

OPTIONS
       --infrastructure-configuration-arn (string)

          that you want to update.

       --description (string)
          The description of the infrastructure configuration.

       --instance-types (list)
          The instance types of  the  infrastructure  configuration.  You  can
          specify  one  or more instance types to use for this build. The ser-
          vice will pick one of these instance types based on availability.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --instance-profile-name (string)
          The instance profile to associate with the instance used to  custom-
          ize your Amazon EC2 AMI.

       --security-group-ids (list)
          The  security  group IDs to associate with the instance used to cus-
          tomize your Amazon EC2 AMI.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --subnet-id (string)
          The subnet ID to place the instance used to  customize  your  Amazon
          EC2 AMI in.

       --logging (structure)
          The logging configuration of the infrastructure configuration.

          s3Logs -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 logging configuration.

              s3BucketName -> (string)
                 The S3 bucket in which to store the logs.

              s3KeyPrefix -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 path to the bucket where the logs are stored.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          s3Logs={s3BucketName=string,s3KeyPrefix=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "s3Logs": {
              "s3BucketName": "string",
              "s3KeyPrefix": "string"
            }
          }

       --key-pair (string)
          The  key  pair of the infrastructure configuration. You can use this
          to log on to and debug the instance used to create your image.

       --terminate-instance-on-failure  |   --no-terminate-instance-on-failure
       (boolean)
          The terminate instance on failure setting of the infrastructure con-
          figuration. Set to false if you want Image Builder to retain the in-
          stance used to configure your AMI if the build or test phase of your
          workflow fails.

       --sns-topic-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the SNS topic to  which  we  send
          image build event notifications.

          NOTE:
              EC2  Image Builder is unable to send notifications to SNS topics
              that are encrypted using keys from other accounts. The key  that
              is used to encrypt the SNS topic must reside in the account that
              the Image Builder service runs under.

       --client-token (string)
          The idempotency token used to make this request idempotent.

       --resource-tags (map)
          The tags attached to the resource created by Image Builder.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --instance-metadata-options (structure)
          The instance metadata options that you can set for the HTTP requests
          that pipeline builds use to launch EC2 build and test instances. For
          more information about instance metadata options,  see  one  of  the
          following links:

          o Configure  the  instance metadata options in the * Amazon EC2 User
            Guide * for Linux instances.

          o Configure the instance metadata options in the * Amazon  EC2  Win-
            dows Guide * for Windows instances.

          httpTokens -> (string)
              Indicates whether a signed token header is required for instance
              metadata retrieval requests. The values affect the  response  as
              follows:

              o required   When you retrieve the IAM role credentials, version
                2.0 credentials are returned in all cases.

              o optional  You can include a signed token header  in  your  re-
                quest  to retrieve instance metadata, or you can leave it out.
                If you include it, version 2.0 credentials  are  returned  for
                the IAM role. Otherwise, version 1.0 credentials are returned.

              The default setting is optional .

          httpPutResponseHopLimit -> (integer)
              Limit  the  number of hops that an instance metadata request can
              traverse to reach its destination.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          httpTokens=string,httpPutResponseHopLimit=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "httpTokens": "string",
            "httpPutResponseHopLimit": integer
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
