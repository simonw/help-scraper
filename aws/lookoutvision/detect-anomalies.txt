DETECT-ANOMALIES()                                          DETECT-ANOMALIES()



NAME
       detect-anomalies -

DESCRIPTION
       Detects anomalies in an image that you supply.

       The  response  from  DetectAnomalies includes a boolean prediction that
       the image contains one or more anomalies and a confidence value for the
       prediction.

       NOTE:
          Before  calling  DetectAnomalies  ,  you must first start your model
          with the  StartModel operation. You are charged for  the  amount  of
          time,  in  minutes,  that a model runs and for the number of anomaly
          detection units that your model uses. If you are not using a  model,
          use the  StopModel operation to stop your model.

       This  operation  requires  permissions to perform the lookoutvision:De-
       tectAnomalies operation.

SYNOPSIS
            detect-anomalies
          --project-name <value>
          --model-version <value>
          --body <value>
          --content-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project-name (string)
          The name of the project that contains the  model  version  that  you
          want to use.

       --model-version (string)
          The version of the model that you want to use.

       --body (blob)
          The unencrypted image bytes that you want to analyze.

       --content-type (string)
          The  type  of  the image passed in Body . Valid values are image/png
          (PNG format images) and image/jpeg (JPG format images).

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DetectAnomalyResult -> (structure)
          The results of the DetectAnomalies operation.

          Source -> (structure)
              The source of the image that was analyzed. direct means that the
              images was supplied from the local computer. No other values are
              supported.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of the image.

          IsAnomalous -> (boolean)
              True if the image contains an anomaly, otherwise false.

          Confidence -> (float)
              The confidence that Amazon Lookout for Vision has in  the  accu-
              racy of the prediction.
