DESCRIPTION
       Describes an Amazon Lookout for Vision model packaging job.

       This  operation  requires  permissions to perform the lookoutvision:De-
       scribeModelPackagingJob operation.

       For more information, see Using your Amazon Lookout for Vision model on
       an edge device in the Amazon Lookout for Vision Developer Guide.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-model-packaging-job
          --project-name <value>
          --job-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project-name (string)
          The  name  of the project that contains the model packaging job that
          you want to describe.

       --job-name (string)
          The job name for the model packaging job.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
