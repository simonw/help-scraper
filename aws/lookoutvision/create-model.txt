CREATE-MODEL()                                                  CREATE-MODEL()



NAME
       create-model -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new version of a model within an an Amazon Lookout for Vision
       project. CreateModel is an asynchronous operation in which Amazon Look-
       out for Vision trains, tests, and evaluates a new version of a model.

       To  get  the current status, check the Status field returned in the re-
       sponse from  DescribeModel .

       If the project has a single dataset, Amazon Lookout for  Vision  inter-
       nally  splits  the  dataset to create a training and a test dataset. If
       the project has a training and a test dataset, Lookout for Vision  uses
       the respective datasets to train and test the model.

       After  training completes, the evaluation metrics are stored at the lo-
       cation specified in OutputConfig .

       This operation requires permissions to perform  the  lookoutvision:Cre-
       ateModel  operation.  If  you  want to tag your model, you also require
       permission to the lookoutvision:TagResource operation.

OPTIONS
       --project-name (string)
          The name of the project in which you want to create a model version.

       --description (string)
          A description for the version of the model.

       --client-token (string)
          ClientToken is an idempotency token that ensures a call  to  Create-
          Model  completes  only once. You choose the value to pass. For exam-
          ple, An issue might prevent you from getting a response from Create-
          Model . In this case, safely retry your call to CreateModel by using
          the same ClientToken parameter value.

          If you don't supply a value for ClientToken , the AWS  SDK  you  are
          using inserts a value for you. This prevents retries after a network
          error from starting multiple training jobs. You'll need  to  provide
          your own value for other use cases.

          An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in
          the first request. Using a different value for ClientToken  is  con-
          sidered  a  new call to CreateModel . An idempotency token is active
          for 8 hours.

       --output-config (structure)
          The location where Amazon Lookout for Vision saves the training  re-
          sults.

          S3Location -> (structure)
              The S3 location for the output.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The  S3  bucket that contains the training or model packaging
                 job output. If you are training a model, the bucket  must  in
                 your AWS account. If you use an S3 bucket for a model packag-
                 ing job, the S3 bucket must be in the same AWS Region and AWS
                 account in which you use AWS IoT Greengrass.

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The  path  of the folder, within the S3 bucket, that contains
                 the output.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Location={Bucket=string,Prefix=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Location": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Prefix": "string"
            }
          }

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The identifier for your AWS KMS key. The  key  is  used  to  encrypt
          training and test images copied into the service for model training.
          Your source images are unaffected. If this parameter is  not  speci-
          fied,  the  copied  images  are encrypted by a key that AWS owns and
          manages.

       --tags (list)
          A set of tags (key-value pairs) that  you  want  to  attach  to  the
          model.

          (structure)
              A  key  and  value pair that is attached to the specified Amazon
              Lookout for Vision model.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag that is attached to the specified model.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag that is attached to the specified model.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
