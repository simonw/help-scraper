DESCRIBE-MODEL()                                              DESCRIBE-MODEL()



NAME
       describe-model -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes a version of an Amazon Lookout for Vision model.

       This  operation  requires  permissions to perform the lookoutvision:De-
       scribeModel operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-model
          --project-name <value>
          --model-version <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project-name (string)
          The project that contains the version of a model that  you  want  to
          describe.

       --model-version (string)
          The version of the model that you want to describe.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 The overall recall metric value for the trained model.

              Precision -> (float)
                 The overall precision metric value for the trained model.

          OutputConfig -> (structure)
              The  S3  location  where  Amazon  Lookout for Vision saves model
              training files.

              S3Location -> (structure)
                 The S3 location for the output.

                     The S3 bucket that contains the training or model packag-
                     ing  job  output. If you are training a model, the bucket
                     must in your AWS account. If you use an S3 bucket  for  a
                     model  packaging  job,  the S3 bucket must be in the same
                     AWS Region and AWS account  in  which  you  use  AWS  IoT
                     Greengrass.

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     The  path  of the folder, within the S3 bucket, that con-
                     tains the output.

          EvaluationManifest -> (structure)
              The S3 location where Amazon Lookout for Vision saves the  mani-
              fest  file  that was used to test the trained model and generate
              the performance scores.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The bucket that contains the training output.

                 The location of the training output in the bucket.

          EvaluationResult -> (structure)
              The S3 location where Amazon Lookout for Vision saves  the  per-
              formance metrics.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The bucket that contains the training output.

              Key -> (string)
                 The location of the training output in the bucket.

          EvaluationEndTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The  unix  timestamp  for  the date and time that the evaluation
              ended.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)

              more information, see  StartModel

          MaxInferenceUnits -> (integer)
              The maximum number of inference units Amazon Lookout for  Vision
              uses  to auto-scale the model. For more information, see  Start-
