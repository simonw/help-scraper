DELETE-MODEL()                                                  DELETE-MODEL()



NAME
       delete-model -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  an Amazon Lookout for Vision model. You can't delete a running
       model. To stop a running model, use the  StopModel operation.

       It might take a few seconds to delete a model. To determine if a  model
       has  been  deleted,  call   ListModels  and check if the version of the
       model (ModelVersion ) is in the Models array.

       This  operation  requires  permissions  to   perform   the   lookoutvi-
       sion:DeleteModel operation.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-model
          --project-name <value>
          --model-version <value>
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  project that contains the model that you want to
          delete.

       --model-version (string)
          The version of the model that you want to delete.

       --client-token (string)
          ClientToken is an idempotency token that ensures a call  to  Delete-
          Model  completes  only once. You choose the value to pass. For exam-
          ple, an issue might prevent you from getting a response from Delete-
          Model . In this case, safely retry your call to DeleteModel by using
          the same ClientToken parameter value.

          If you don't supply a value for ClientToken, the AWS SDK you are us-
          ing  inserts  a value for you. This prevents retries after a network
          error from making multiple model deletion requests. You'll  need  to
          provide your own value for other use cases.

          An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in
          the first request. Using a different value for ClientToken  is  con-
          sidered  a  new call to DeleteModel . An idempotency token is active
          for 8 hours.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ModelArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the model that was deleted.
