BATCH-ASSOCIATE-CLIENT-DEVICE-BATCH-ASSOCIATE-CLIENT-DEVICE-WITH-CORE-DEVICE()



NAME
       batch-associate-client-device-with-core-device -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  a  list  of client devices with a core device. Use this API
       operation to specify which client devices can discover  a  core  device
       through  cloud  discovery. With cloud discovery, client devices connect
       to IoT Greengrass to retrieve associated core devices' connectivity in-
       formation  and  certificates. For more information, see Configure cloud
       discovery in the IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide .

       NOTE:
          Client devices are local IoT devices that connect to and communicate
          with an IoT Greengrass core device over MQTT. You can connect client
          devices to a core device to sync MQTT messages and  data  to  Amazon
          Web Services IoT Core and interact with client devices in Greengrass
          components. For more information, see Interact with  local  IoT  de-
          vices in the IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            batch-associate-client-device-with-core-device
          [--entries <value>]
          --core-device-thing-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --entries (list)
          The list of client devices to associate.

          (structure)
              Contains  a request to associate a client device with a core de-
              vice.  The  BatchAssociateClientDeviceWithCoreDevice   operation
              consumes a list of these requests.

              thingName -> (string)
                 The  name  of the IoT thing that represents the client device
                 to associate.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          thingName=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "thingName": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --core-device-thing-name (string)
          The name of the core device. This is also the name of the IoT thing.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To associate client devices with a core device

       The  following  batch-associate-client-device-with-core-device  example
       associates two client devices with a core device.

          aws greengrassv2 batch-associate-client-device-with-core-device \
            --core-device-thing-name MyGreengrassCore \
            --entries thingName=MyClientDevice1 thingName=MyClientDevice2

       Output:

          {
              "errorEntries": []
          }

       For more information, see Interact with local IoT devices  in  the  AWS
       IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       errorEntries -> (list)
          The  list  of  any errors for the entries in the request. Each error
          entry contains the name of the IoT thing that failed to associate.

          (structure)
              Contains an error that occurs from  a  request  to  associate  a
              client      device      with      a     core     device.     The
              BatchAssociateClientDeviceWithCoreDevice  operation  returns   a
              list of these errors.

              thingName -> (string)
                 The name of the IoT thing whose associate request failed.

              code -> (string)
                 The error code for the request.

              message -> (string)
                 A  message that provides additional information about the er-
                 ror.
