CREATE-DEPLOYMENT()                                        CREATE-DEPLOYMENT()



NAME
       create-deployment -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  continuous  deployment  for a target, which is a Greengrass
       core device or group of core devices. When you add a new core device to
       a  group  of core devices that has a deployment, IoT Greengrass deploys
       that group's deployment to the new device.

       You can define one deployment for each target. When you  create  a  new
       deployment  for  a  target that has an existing deployment, you replace
       the previous deployment. IoT Greengrass applies the new  deployment  to
       the target devices.

       Every  deployment has a revision number that indicates how many deploy-
       ment revisions you define for a target. Use this operation to create  a
       new revision of an existing deployment.

       For  more information, see the Create deployments in the IoT Greengrass
       V2 Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            create-deployment
          --target-arn <value>
          [--deployment-name <value>]
          [--components <value>]
          [--iot-job-configuration <value>]
          [--deployment-policies <value>]
          [--tags <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --target-arn (string)
          The ARN of the target IoT thing or thing group.

       --deployment-name (string)
          The name of the deployment.

       --components (map)
          The components to deploy. This is a dictionary, where  each  key  is
          the  name  of  a  component, and each key's value is the version and
          configuration to deploy for that component.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Contains information about a component to deploy.

              componentVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the component.

              configurationUpdate -> (structure)
                 The configuration updates to deploy for  the  component.  You
                 can  define  reset updates and merge updates. A reset updates
                 the keys that you specify to the  default  configuration  for
                 the  component.  A  merge updates the core device's component
                 configuration with the keys and values that you specify.  The
                 IoT  Greengrass Core software applies reset updates before it
                 applies merge updates. For more information, see Update  com-
                 ponent  configurations  in  the  IoT  Greengrass V2 Developer
                 Guide .

                 merge -> (string)
                     A serialized JSON string that contains the  configuration
                     object to merge to target devices. The core device merges
                     this configuration with the component's existing configu-
                     ration.  If this is the first time a component deploys on
                     a device, the core device merges this configuration  with
                     the  component's  default  configuration. This means that
                     the core device keeps  it's  existing  configuration  for
                     keys  and  values  that you don't specify in this object.
                     For more information, see Merge configuration updates  in
                     the IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide .

                 reset -> (list)
                     The  list of configuration nodes to reset to default val-
                     ues on target devices. Use JSON pointers to specify  each
                     node  to  reset. JSON pointers start with a forward slash
                     (/ ) and use forward slashes to separate the key for each
                     level  in  the object. For more information, see the JSON
                     pointer specification and Reset configuration updates  in
                     the IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide .

                     (string)

              runWith -> (structure)
                 The  system user and group that the IoT Greengrass Core soft-
                 ware uses to run component processes on the core  device.  If
                 you  omit  this  parameter,  the IoT Greengrass Core software
                 uses the system user and group that  you  configure  for  the
                 core device. For more information, see Configure the user and
                 group that run components in the IoT Greengrass V2  Developer
                 Guide .

                 posixUser -> (string)
                     The  POSIX  system  user and, optionally, group to use to
                     run this component on Linux core devices. The  user,  and
                     group if specified, must exist on each Linux core device.
                     Specify the user and group separated by a colon (:  )  in
                     the following format: user:group . The group is optional.
                     If you don't specify a group,  the  IoT  Greengrass  Core
                     software uses the primary user for the group.

                     If you omit this parameter, the IoT Greengrass Core soft-
                     ware uses the default system user and group that you con-
                     figure  on the Greengrass nucleus component. For more in-
                     formation, see Configure the user and group that run com-
                     ponents .

                 systemResourceLimits -> (structure)
                     The  system  resource limits to apply to this component's
                     process on the core device. IoT Greengrass currently sup-
                     ports this feature on only Linux core devices.

                     If you omit this parameter, the IoT Greengrass Core soft-
                     ware uses the default system  resource  limits  that  you
                     configure  on  the Greengrass nucleus component. For more
                     information, see Configure  system  resource  limits  for
                     components .

                     memory -> (long)
                        The  maximum  amount  of  RAM, expressed in kilobytes,
                        that a component's processes can use on the  core  de-
                        vice.

                     cpus -> (double)
                        The maximum amount of CPU time that a component's pro-
                        cesses can use on the core device. A core device's to-
                        tal  CPU  time is equivalent to the device's number of
                        CPU cores. For example, on a core device  with  4  CPU
                        cores, you can set this value to 2 to limit the compo-
                        nent's processes to 50 percent usage of each CPU core.
                        On a device with 1 CPU core, you can set this value to
                        0.25 to limit the component's processes to 25  percent
                        usage  of  the  CPU. If you set this value to a number
                        greater than the number of CPU cores, the  IoT  Green-
                        grass  Core software doesn't limit the component's CPU
                        usage.

                 windowsUser -> (string)
                     The Windows user to use to run this component on  Windows
                     core  devices.  The  user must exist on each Windows core
                     device, and its name and password must be in  the  Local-
                     System account's Credentials Manager instance.

                     If you omit this parameter, the IoT Greengrass Core soft-
                     ware uses the default Windows user that you configure  on
                     the  Greengrass  nucleus component. For more information,
                     see Configure the user and group that run components .

          figuration  specifies  the rollout, timeout, and stop configurations
          for the deployment configuration.

          jobExecutionsRolloutConfig -> (structure)
              The rollout configuration for the job.  This  configuration  de-
              fines the rate at which the job rolls out to the fleet of target
              devices.

              exponentialRate -> (structure)
                 The exponential rate to increase the job rollout rate.

                     notification,  per  minute, when the job starts. This pa-
                     rameter defines the initial rollout rate of the job.

                 incrementFactor -> (double)
                     The exponential factor to increase the rollout  rate  for
                     the job.

                     This parameter supports up to one digit after the decimal
                     (for example, you can specify 1.5 , but not 1.55 ).

                 rateIncreaseCriteria -> (structure)

                        before the rollout rate increases.

                     numberOfSucceededThings -> (integer)
                        The number of devices to successfully run the configu-
                        ration job before the rollout rate increases.

              maximumPerMinute -> (integer)
                 The maximum number of devices that receive a pending job  no-
                 tification, per minute.

          abortConfig -> (structure)
              The  stop  configuration for the job. This configuration defines
              when and how to stop a job rollout.

              criteriaList -> (list)
                 The list of criteria that define when and how to  cancel  the
                 configuration deployment.

                 (structure)
                     Contains  criteria  that  define when and how to cancel a
                     job.

                     The deployment stops  if  the  following  conditions  are
                     true:

                     o The  number  of  things that receive the deployment ex-
                       ceeds the minNumberOfExecutedThings .

                     o The percentage of failures with  type  failureType  ex-
                       ceeds the thresholdPercentage .

                     failureType -> (string)
                        The  type  of job deployment failure that can cancel a
                        job.

                     action -> (string)
                        The action to perform when the criteria are met.

                     thresholdPercentage -> (double)
                        The minimum percentage of  failureType  failures  that
                        occur before the job can cancel.

                        This  parameter  supports  up  to two digits after the
                        decimal (for example, you can specify 10.9 or 10.99  ,
                        but not 10.999 ).

                     minNumberOfExecutedThings -> (integer)
                        The minimum number of things that receive the configu-
                        ration before the job can cancel.

          timeoutConfig -> (structure)
              The timeout configuration for the job.  This  configuration  de-
              fines the amount of time each device has to complete the job.

              inProgressTimeoutInMinutes -> (long)
                 The amount of time, in minutes, that devices have to complete
                 the job. The timer starts when  the  job  status  is  set  to
                 IN_PROGRESS  . If the job status doesn't change to a terminal
                 state before the time expires, then the job status is set  to
                 TIMED_OUT .

                 The  timeout  interval  must  be  between 1 minute and 7 days
                 (10080 minutes).

              to devices.

              timeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The amount of time in seconds that each component on a device
                 has  to  report  that  it's  safe to update. If the component
                 waits for longer than this timeout, then the deployment  pro-
                 ceeds on the device.

                 Default: 60

              action -> (string)
                 Whether  or  not to notify components and wait for components
                 to become safe to update. Choose from the following options:

                 o NOTIFY_COMPONENTS  The deployment notifies  each  component
                   before  it stops and updates that component. Components can
                   use the SubscribeToComponentUpdates IPC  operation  to  re-
                   ceive  these  notifications.  Then,  components can respond
                   with the DeferComponentUpdate IPC operation. For  more  in-
                   formation,  see Create deployments in the IoT Greengrass V2
                   Developer Guide .

                 o SKIP_NOTIFY_COMPONENTS  The deployment doesn't notify  com-
                   ponents or wait for them to be safe to update.

                 Default: NOTIFY_COMPONENTS

          configurationValidationPolicy -> (structure)
              The  configuration  validation  policy for the configuration de-
              ployment. This policy defines how long  each  component  has  to
              validate its configure updates.

              timeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The  amount  of time in seconds that a component can validate
                 its configuration updates. If  the  validation  time  exceeds
                 this timeout, then the deployment proceeds for the device.

                 Default: 30

            ...}

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you can provide to ensure
          that the request is idempotent. Idempotency means that  the  request
          is  successfully  processed  only once, even if you send the request
          multiple times. When a request succeeds, and you  specify  the  same
          client  token for subsequent successful requests, the IoT Greengrass
          V2 service returns the successful response that it caches  from  the
          previous  request. IoT Greengrass V2 caches successful responses for
          idempotent requests for up to 8 hours.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To create a deployment

       The following create-deployment example deploys the AWS IoT  Greengrass
       Command Line Interface to a core device.

          aws greengrassv2 create-deployment \
              --cli-input-json file://cli-deployment.json

       Contents of cli-deployment.json:

          {
              "targetArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:thing/MyGreengrassCore",
              "deploymentName": "Deployment for MyGreengrassCore",
              "components": {
                  "aws.greengrass.Cli": {
                      "componentVersion": "2.0.3"
                  }
              },
              "deploymentPolicies": {
                  "failureHandlingPolicy": "DO_NOTHING",
                  "componentUpdatePolicy": {
                      "timeoutInSeconds": 60,
                      "action": "NOTIFY_COMPONENTS"
                  },

              },
              "iotJobConfiguration": {}
          }

       Output:

          {
              "deploymentId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
          }

       V2 Developer Guide.

       Example 2: To create a deployment that updates component configurations

       The following create-deployment example deploys the AWS IoT  Greengrass
       nucleus  component  to a group of core devices. This deployment applies
       the following configuration updates for the nucleus component:

       o Reset the target devices' proxy settings to their  default  no  proxy
         settings.

       o Reset the target devices' MQTT settings to their defaults.

       o Sets the JVM options for the nucleus' JVM.

       o Sets the logging level for the nucleus.

          aws greengrassv2 create-deployment \
              --cli-input-json file://nucleus-deployment.json

       Contents of nucleus-deployment.json:
