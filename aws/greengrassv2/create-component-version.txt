CREATE-COMPONENT-VERSION()                          CREATE-COMPONENT-VERSION()



NAME
       create-component-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  component.  Components  are software that run on Greengrass
       core devices. After you develop and test a component on your  core  de-
       vice, you can use this operation to upload your component to IoT Green-
       grass. Then, you can deploy the component to other core devices.

       You can use this operation to do the following:

       o Create components from recipes   Create a component  from  a  recipe,
         which  is  a  file that defines the component's metadata, parameters,
         dependencies, lifecycle, artifacts, and platform capability. For more
         information, see IoT Greengrass component recipe reference in the IoT
         Greengrass V2 Developer Guide . To create a component from a  recipe,
         specify inlineRecipe when you call this operation.

       o Create  components from Lambda functions   Create a component from an
         Lambda function that runs on IoT Greengrass. This  creates  a  recipe
         and  artifacts from the Lambda function's deployment package. You can
         use this operation to migrate Lambda functions from IoT Greengrass V1
         to  IoT  Greengrass  V2.  This function only accepts Lambda functions
         that use the following runtimes:

         o Python 2.7  python2.7

         o Python 3.7  python3.7

         o Python 3.8  python3.8

         o Java 8  java8

         o Node.js 10  nodejs10.x

         o Node.js 12  nodejs12.x

       To create a component from a Lambda  function,  specify  lambdaFunction
       when you call this operation.

       NOTE:
          IoT  Greengrass  currently  supports  Lambda functions on only Linux
          core devices.

SYNOPSIS
            create-component-version
          [--inline-recipe <value>]
          [--lambda-function <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --inline-recipe (blob)
          The recipe to use to create the component. The  recipe  defines  the
          component's  metadata,  parameters,  dependencies,  lifecycle, arti-
          facts, and platform compatibility.

          You must specify either inlineRecipe or lambdaFunction .

       --lambda-function (structure)
          The parameters to create a component from a Lambda function.

          You must specify either inlineRecipe or lambdaFunction .

          lambdaArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the Lambda function. The ARN must include the version
              of  the  function  to import. You can't use version aliases like
              $LATEST .

          componentName -> (string)
              The name of the component.

              Defaults to the name of the Lambda function.

          componentVersion -> (string)
              The version of the component.

              Defaults to the version of the Lambda  function  as  a  semantic
              version. For example, if your function version is 3 , the compo-
              nent version becomes 3.0.0 .

          componentPlatforms -> (list)
              The platforms that the component version supports.

              (structure)
                 Contains information about a platform that a  component  sup-
                 ports.

                 name -> (string)
                     The  friendly  name  of the platform. This name helps you
                     identify the platform.

                     If you omit this  parameter,  IoT  Greengrass  creates  a
                     friendly  name  from the os and architecture of the plat-
                     form.

                 attributes -> (map)
                     A dictionary of attributes  for  the  platform.  The  IoT
                     Greengrass  Core  software defines the os and platform by
                     default. You can specify additional  platform  attributes
                     for  a core device when you deploy the Greengrass nucleus
                     component. For more information, see the  Greengrass  nu-
                     cleus  component in the IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide
                     .

                     value -> (string)

          componentDependencies -> (map)
              The component versions on which this Lambda  function  component
              depends.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 Contains  information  about  a  component  dependency  for a
                 Lambda function component.

                     The component version requirement for the  component  de-
                     pendency.

                     IoT  Greengrass V2 uses semantic version constraints. For
                     more information, see Semantic Versioning .

                 dependencyType -> (string)
                     The type of this dependency. Choose  from  the  following
                     options:

                     o SOFT   The  component doesn't restart if the dependency
                       changes state.

                     o HARD  The component restarts if the dependency  changes
                       state.

                     Default: HARD

          componentLambdaParameters -> (structure)
              The  system and runtime parameters for the Lambda function as it
              runs on the Greengrass core device.

              eventSources -> (list)
                 The list of event sources to which to  subscribe  to  receive
                 work  messages.  The  Lambda function runs when it receives a
                 message from an event source. You can subscribe this function
                 to  local  publish/subscribe messages and Amazon Web Services
                 IoT Core MQTT messages.

                 (structure)
                     Contains information about an event source for an  Lambda
                     function.  The  event  source defines the topics on which
                     this Lambda function subscribes to receive messages  that
                     run the function.

                     topic -> (string)
                        The  topic to which to subscribe to receive event mes-
                        sages.

                     type -> (string)
                        The type of event source. Choose  from  the  following
                        options:

                        o PUB_SUB   Subscribe  to local publish/subscribe mes-
                          sages. This event source type doesn't  support  MQTT
                          wildcards (+ and # ) in the event source topic.

                        o IOT_CORE   Subscribe to Amazon Web Services IoT Core
                          MQTT messages. This event source type supports  MQTT
                          wildcards (+ and # ) in the event source topic.

              maxQueueSize -> (integer)
                 The maximum size of the message queue for the Lambda function
                 component. The IoT Greengrass core stores messages in a  FIFO
                 (first-in-first-out)  queue until it can run the Lambda func-
                 tion to consume each message.

              maxInstancesCount -> (integer)
                 The maximum number of  instances  that  a  non-pinned  Lambda
                 function can run at the same time.

              maxIdleTimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  amount  of  time  in  seconds that a non-pinned
                 Lambda function can idle before the IoT Greengrass Core soft-
                 ware stops its process.

              timeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  amount of time in seconds that the Lambda func-
                 tion can process a work item.

              statusTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The interval in seconds at which  a  pinned  (also  known  as
                 long-lived) Lambda function component sends status updates to
                 the Lambda manager component.

              pinned -> (boolean)
                 Whether or not the Lambda function is pinned, or long-lived.

                 o A pinned Lambda function starts when IoT Greengrass  starts
                   and keeps running in its own container.

                 o A non-pinned Lambda function starts only when it receives a
                   work item and exists after it idles  for  maxIdleTimeInSec-
                   onds  .  If  the  function has multiple work items, the IoT
                   Greengrass Core software creates multiple instances of  the
                   function.

                 Default: true

              inputPayloadEncodingType -> (string)
                 The encoding type that the Lambda function supports.

                 Default: json

              execArgs -> (list)
                 The  list of arguments to pass to the Lambda function when it
                 runs.

                 (string)

              environmentVariables -> (map)
                 The map of environment variables that are  available  to  the
                 Lambda function when it runs.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              linuxProcessParams -> (structure)

                 isolationMode -> (string)
                     The isolation mode for  the  process  that  contains  the
                     Lambda  function. The process can run in an isolated run-
                     time environment inside the IoT Greengrass container,  or
                     as a regular process outside any container.

                     Default: GreengrassContainer

                 containerParams -> (structure)
                     The  parameters  for  the  container  in which the Lambda
                     function runs.

                        The memory size of the container, expressed  in  kilo-
                        bytes.

                        Default: 16384 (16 MB)

                     mountROSysfs -> (boolean)
                        Whether or not the container can read information from
                        the device's /sys folder.

                        Default: false

                     volumes -> (list)

                            Contains information about  a  volume  that  Linux
                            processes  in a container can access. When you de-
                            fine a volume, the IoT  Greengrass  Core  software
                            mounts  the source files to the destination inside
                            the container.

                            sourcePath -> (string)
                               The path to the physical  volume  in  the  file
                               system.

                            destinationPath -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you can provide to ensure
          that the request is idempotent. Idempotency means that  the  request
          is  successfully  processed  only once, even if you send the request
          multiple times. When a request succeeds, and you  specify  the  same
          client  token for subsequent successful requests, the IoT Greengrass
          V2 service returns the successful response that it caches  from  the
          previous  request. IoT Greengrass V2 caches successful responses for
          idempotent requests for up to 8 hours.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To create a component version from a recipe

       The  following  create-component-version example creates a version of a
       Hello World component from a recipe file.

          aws greengrassv2 create-component-version \
              --inline-recipe fileb://com.example.HelloWorld-1.0.0.json

       Contents of com.example.HelloWorld-1.0.0.json:

       Example 2: To create a component version from an AWS Lambda function

       The  following  create-component-version example creates a version of a
       Hello World component from an AWS Lambda function.

          aws greengrassv2 create-component-version \
              --cli-input-json file://lambda-function-component.json

OUTPUT
       arn -> (string)
          The ARN of the component version.

       componentName -> (string)
          The name of the component.

       componentVersion -> (string)
          The version of the component.

       creationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
          The  time  at which the component was created, expressed in ISO 8601
          format.

       status -> (structure)
          The status of the component version in IoT Greengrass V2. This  sta-
          tus is different from the status of the component on a core device.

          componentState -> (string)
              The state of the component.

          message -> (string)
              A  message  that communicates details, such as errors, about the
              status of the component.

          errors -> (map)
              A dictionary of errors that communicate why the component is  in
              an  error  state. For example, if IoT Greengrass can't access an
              artifact for the component, then errors contains the  artifact's
              URI as a key, and the error message as the value for that key.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)
