RESOLVE-COMPONENT-CANDIDATES()                  RESOLVE-COMPONENT-CANDIDATES()



NAME
       resolve-component-candidates -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  list  of components that meet the component, version, and
       platform requirements of a deployment.  Greengrass  core  devices  call
       this  operation  when  they receive a deployment to identify the compo-
       nents to install.

       This operation identifies components that meet all dependency  require-
       ments  for a deployment. If the requirements conflict, then this opera-
       tion returns an error and the deployment fails. For example,  this  oc-
       curs  if  component  A requires version >2.0.0 and component B requires
       version <2.0.0 of a component dependency.

       When you specify the component candidates to  resolve,  IoT  Greengrass
       compares  each  component's digest from the core device with the compo-
       nent's digest in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. If  the  digests  don't
       match, then IoT Greengrass specifies to use the version from the Amazon
       Web Services Cloud.

       WARNING:
          To use this operation, you must use the data plane API endpoint  and
          authenticate  with  an IoT device certificate. For more information,
          see IoT Greengrass endpoints and quotas .

SYNOPSIS
            resolve-component-candidates
          --platform <value>
          --component-candidates <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --platform (structure)
          The platform to use to resolve compatible components.

          name -> (string)
              The friendly name of the platform. This name helps you  identify
              the platform.

              If  you  omit  this parameter, IoT Greengrass creates a friendly
              name from the os and architecture of the platform.

          attributes -> (map)
              A dictionary of attributes for the platform. The IoT  Greengrass
              Core  software  defines  the os and platform by default. You can
              specify additional platform attributes for a  core  device  when
              you  deploy  the Greengrass nucleus component. For more informa-
              tion, see the Greengrass nucleus component in the IoT Greengrass
              V2 Developer Guide .

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,attributes={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "name": "string",
            "attributes": {"string": "string"
              ...}
          }

       --component-candidates (list)
          The list of components to resolve.

          (structure)
              Contains  information  about  a component that is a candidate to
              deploy to a Greengrass core device.

              componentName -> (string)
                 The name of the component.

              componentVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the component.

              versionRequirements -> (map)
                 The version requirements for  the  component's  dependencies.
                 Greengrass  core  devices  get  the version requirements from
                 component recipes.

                 IoT Greengrass V2 uses semantic version constraints. For more
                 information, see Semantic Versioning .

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          componentName=string,componentVersion=string,versionRequirements={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "componentName": "string",
              "componentVersion": "string",
              "versionRequirements": {"string": "string"
                ...}
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       resolvedComponentVersions -> (list)
          A  list of components that meet the requirements that you specify in
          the request. This list includes each component's recipe that you can
          use to install the component.

          (structure)
              Contains  information about a component version that is compati-
              ble to run on a Greengrass core device.

              arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the component version.

              componentName -> (string)
                 The name of the component.

              componentVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the component.

              recipe -> (blob)
                 The recipe of the component version.
