LIST-CLIENT-DEVICES-ASSOCIATELIST-CLIENT-DEVICES-ASSOCIATED-WITH-CORE-DEVICE()



NAME
       list-client-devices-associated-with-core-device -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a paginated list of client devices that are associated with a
       core device.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-client-devices-associated-with-core-device is a  paginated  opera-
       tion.  Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire
       data set of results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by  providing  the
       --no-paginate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argu-
       ment on a paginated response, the --query argument  must  extract  data
       from  the results of the following query expressions: associatedClient-
       Devices

SYNOPSIS
            list-client-devices-associated-with-core-device
          --core-device-thing-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --core-device-thing-name (string)
          The name of the core device. This is also the name of the IoT thing.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the client devices associated with a core device

       The following  list-client-devices-associated-with-core-device  example
       lists all client devices associated with a core device.

          aws greengrassv2 list-client-devices-associated-with-core-device \
            --core-device-thing-name MyTestGreengrassCore

       Output:

          {
              "associatedClientDevices": [
                  {
                      "thingName": "MyClientDevice2",
                      "associationTimestamp": "2021-07-12T16:33:55.843000-07:00"
                  },
                  {
                      "thingName": "MyClientDevice1",
                      "associationTimestamp": "2021-07-12T16:33:55.843000-07:00"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       associatedClientDevices -> (list)
          A list that describes the client devices that  are  associated  with
          the core device.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a client device that is associated to
              a core device for cloud discovery.

              thingName -> (string)
                 The name of the IoT  thing  that  represents  the  associated
                 client device.

              associationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  time that the client device was associated, expressed in
                 ISO 8601 format.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results, or null if there are no addi-
          tional results.
