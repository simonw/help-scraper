DESCRIBE-COMPONENT()                                      DESCRIBE-COMPONENT()



NAME
       describe-component -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves metadata for a version of a component.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-component
          --arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The ARN of the component version.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a component version

       The following describe-component example describes a Hello World compo-
       nent.

          aws greengrassv2 describe-component \
              --arn arn:aws:greengrass:us-west-2:123456789012:components:com.example.HelloWorld:versions:1.0.0

       Output:

          {
              "arn": "arn:aws:greengrass:us-west-2:123456789012:components:com.example.HelloWorld:versions:1.0.0",
              "componentName": "com.example.HelloWorld",
              "componentVersion": "1.0.0",
              "creationTimestamp": "2021-01-07T17:12:11.133000-08:00",
              "publisher": "Amazon",
              "description": "My first AWS IoT Greengrass component.",
              "status": {
                  "componentState": "DEPLOYABLE",
                  "message": "NONE",
                  "errors": {}
              },
              "platforms": [
                  {
                      "attributes": {
                          "os": "linux"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       arn -> (string)
          The ARN of the component version.

       componentName -> (string)
          The name of the component.

       componentVersion -> (string)
          The version of the component.

       creationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
          The  time  at which the component was created, expressed in ISO 8601
          format.

       publisher -> (string)
          The publisher of the component version.

       description -> (string)
          The description of the component version.

       status -> (structure)
          The status of the component version in IoT Greengrass V2. This  sta-
          tus is different from the status of the component on a core device.

          componentState -> (string)
              The state of the component.

          message -> (string)
              A  message  that communicates details, such as errors, about the
              status of the component.

          errors -> (map)
              A dictionary of errors that communicate why the component is  in
              an  error  state. For example, if IoT Greengrass can't access an
              artifact for the component, then errors contains the  artifact's
              URI as a key, and the error message as the value for that key.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

       platforms -> (list)
          The platforms that the component version supports.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a platform that a component supports.

              name -> (string)
                 The  friendly name of the platform. This name helps you iden-
                 tify the platform.

                 If you omit this parameter, IoT Greengrass creates a friendly
                 name from the os and architecture of the platform.

              attributes -> (map)
                 A  dictionary  of attributes for the platform. The IoT Green-
                 grass Core software defines the os and platform  by  default.
                 You can specify additional platform attributes for a core de-
                 vice when you deploy the Greengrass  nucleus  component.  For
                 more information, see the Greengrass nucleus component in the
                 IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide .

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       tags -> (map)
          A list of key-value pairs that contain metadata  for  the  resource.
          For  more  information, see Tag your resources in the IoT Greengrass
          V2 Developer Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
