GET-DEPLOYMENT()                                              GET-DEPLOYMENT()



NAME
       get-deployment -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a deployment. Deployments define the components that run on Green-
       grass core devices.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-deployment
          --deployment-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --deployment-id (string)
          The ID of the deployment.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a deployment

       The following get-deployment example gets information about the deploy-
       ment of the AWS IoT Greengrass nucleus component to a group of core de-
       vices.

OUTPUT
       targetArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the target IoT thing or thing group.

       revisionId -> (string)
          The revision number of the deployment.

       deploymentId -> (string)
          The ID of the deployment.

       deploymentName -> (string)
          The name of the deployment.

       deploymentStatus -> (string)
          The status of the deployment.

       iotJobId -> (string)
          The ID of the IoT job that applies the deployment to target devices.

       iotJobArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the IoT job that applies the  deployment  to  target  de-
          vices.

       components -> (map)
          The  components  to  deploy. This is a dictionary, where each key is
          the name of a component, and each key's value  is  the  version  and
          configuration to deploy for that component.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Contains information about a component to deploy.

              componentVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the component.

              configurationUpdate -> (structure)
                 The  configuration  updates  to deploy for the component. You
                 can define reset updates and merge updates. A  reset  updates
                 the  keys  that  you specify to the default configuration for
                 the component. A merge updates the  core  device's  component
                 configuration  with the keys and values that you specify. The
                 IoT Greengrass Core software applies reset updates before  it
                 applies  merge updates. For more information, see Update com-
                 ponent configurations in  the  IoT  Greengrass  V2  Developer
                 Guide .

                 merge -> (string)
                     A  serialized JSON string that contains the configuration
                     object to merge to target devices. The core device merges
                     this configuration with the component's existing configu-
                     ration. If this is the first time a component deploys  on
                     a  device, the core device merges this configuration with
                     the component's default configuration.  This  means  that
                     the  core  device  keeps  it's existing configuration for
                     keys and values that you don't specify  in  this  object.
                     For  more information, see Merge configuration updates in
                     the IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide .

                 reset -> (list)
                     The list of configuration nodes to reset to default  val-
                     ues  on target devices. Use JSON pointers to specify each
                     node to reset. JSON pointers start with a  forward  slash
                     (/ ) and use forward slashes to separate the key for each
                     level in the object. For more information, see  the  JSON
                     pointer  specification and Reset configuration updates in
                     the IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide .

                     (string)

              runWith -> (structure)
                 The system user and group that the IoT Greengrass Core  soft-
                 ware  uses  to run component processes on the core device. If
                 you omit this parameter, the  IoT  Greengrass  Core  software
                 uses  the  system  user  and group that you configure for the
                 core device. For more information, see Configure the user and
                 group  that run components in the IoT Greengrass V2 Developer
                 Guide .

                 posixUser -> (string)
                     The POSIX system user and, optionally, group  to  use  to
                     run  this  component on Linux core devices. The user, and
                     group if specified, must exist on each Linux core device.
                     Specify  the  user and group separated by a colon (: ) in
                     the following format: user:group . The group is optional.
                     If  you  don't  specify  a group, the IoT Greengrass Core
                     software uses the primary user for the group.

                     If you omit this parameter, the IoT Greengrass Core soft-
                     ware uses the default system user and group that you con-
                     figure on the Greengrass nucleus component. For more  in-
                     formation, see Configure the user and group that run com-
                     ponents .

                 systemResourceLimits -> (structure)
                     The system resource limits to apply to  this  component's
                     process on the core device. IoT Greengrass currently sup-
                     ports this feature on only Linux core devices.

                     If you omit this parameter, the IoT Greengrass Core soft-
                     ware  uses  the  default  system resource limits that you
                     configure on the Greengrass nucleus component.  For  more
                     information,  see  Configure  system  resource limits for
                     components .

                     memory -> (long)
                        The maximum amount of  RAM,  expressed  in  kilobytes,
                        that  a  component's processes can use on the core de-
                        vice.

                     cpus -> (double)
                        The maximum amount of CPU time that a component's pro-
                        cesses can use on the core device. A core device's to-
                        tal CPU time is equivalent to the device's  number  of
                        CPU  cores.  For  example, on a core device with 4 CPU
                        cores, you can set this value to 2 to limit the compo-
                        nent's processes to 50 percent usage of each CPU core.
                        On a device with 1 CPU core, you can set this value to
                        0.25  to limit the component's processes to 25 percent
                        usage of the CPU. If you set this value  to  a  number
                        greater  than  the number of CPU cores, the IoT Green-
                        grass Core software doesn't limit the component's  CPU
                        usage.

                 windowsUser -> (string)
                     The  Windows user to use to run this component on Windows
                     core devices. The user must exist on  each  Windows  core
                     device,  and  its name and password must be in the Local-
                     System account's Credentials Manager instance.

                     If you omit this parameter, the IoT Greengrass Core soft-
                     ware  uses the default Windows user that you configure on
                     the Greengrass nucleus component. For  more  information,
                     see Configure the user and group that run components .

       deploymentPolicies -> (structure)
          The  deployment  policies  for the deployment. These policies define
          how the deployment updates components and handles failure.

          failureHandlingPolicy -> (string)
              The failure handling policy for  the  configuration  deployment.
              This policy defines what to do if the deployment fails.

              Default: ROLLBACK

          componentUpdatePolicy -> (structure)
              The  component  update  policy for the configuration deployment.
              This policy defines when it's safe to deploy  the  configuration
              to devices.

              timeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The amount of time in seconds that each component on a device
                 has to report that it's safe  to  update.  If  the  component
                 waits  for longer than this timeout, then the deployment pro-
                 ceeds on the device.

                 Default: 60

              action -> (string)
                 Whether or not to notify components and wait  for  components
                 to become safe to update. Choose from the following options:

                 o NOTIFY_COMPONENTS   The  deployment notifies each component
                   before it stops and updates that component. Components  can
                   use  the  SubscribeToComponentUpdates  IPC operation to re-
                   ceive these notifications.  Then,  components  can  respond
                   with  the  DeferComponentUpdate IPC operation. For more in-
                   formation, see Create deployments in the IoT Greengrass  V2
                   Developer Guide .

                 o SKIP_NOTIFY_COMPONENTS   The deployment doesn't notify com-
                   ponents or wait for them to be safe to update.

                 Default: NOTIFY_COMPONENTS

          configurationValidationPolicy -> (structure)
              The configuration validation policy for  the  configuration  de-
              ployment.  This  policy  defines  how long each component has to
              validate its configure updates.

              timeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The amount of time in seconds that a component  can  validate
                 its  configuration  updates.  If  the validation time exceeds
                 this timeout, then the deployment proceeds for the device.

                 Default: 30

       iotJobConfiguration -> (structure)
          The job configuration for the deployment configuration. The job con-
          figuration  specifies  the rollout, timeout, and stop configurations
          for the deployment configuration.

          jobExecutionsRolloutConfig -> (structure)
              The rollout configuration for the job.  This  configuration  de-
              fines the rate at which the job rolls out to the fleet of target
              devices.

              exponentialRate -> (structure)
                 The exponential rate to increase the job rollout rate.

                 baseRatePerMinute -> (integer)
                     The minimum number of devices that receive a pending  job
                     notification,  per  minute, when the job starts. This pa-
                     rameter defines the initial rollout rate of the job.

                 incrementFactor -> (double)
                     The exponential factor to increase the rollout  rate  for
                     the job.

                     This parameter supports up to one digit after the decimal
                     (for example, you can specify 1.5 , but not 1.55 ).

                 rateIncreaseCriteria -> (structure)
                     The criteria to increase the rollout rate for the job.

                     numberOfNotifiedThings -> (integer)
                        The number of devices to receive the job  notification
                        before the rollout rate increases.

                     numberOfSucceededThings -> (integer)
                        The number of devices to successfully run the configu-
                        ration job before the rollout rate increases.

              maximumPerMinute -> (integer)
                 The maximum number of devices that receive a pending job  no-
                 tification, per minute.

          abortConfig -> (structure)
              The  stop  configuration for the job. This configuration defines
              when and how to stop a job rollout.

              criteriaList -> (list)
                 The list of criteria that define when and how to  cancel  the
                 configuration deployment.

                 (structure)
                     Contains  criteria  that  define when and how to cancel a
                     job.

                     The deployment stops  if  the  following  conditions  are
                     true:

                     o The  number  of  things that receive the deployment ex-
                       ceeds the minNumberOfExecutedThings .

                     o The percentage of failures with  type  failureType  ex-
                       ceeds the thresholdPercentage .

                     failureType -> (string)
                        The  type  of job deployment failure that can cancel a
                        job.

                     action -> (string)
                        The action to perform when the criteria are met.

                     thresholdPercentage -> (double)
                        The minimum percentage of  failureType  failures  that
                        occur before the job can cancel.

                        This  parameter  supports  up  to two digits after the
                        decimal (for example, you can specify 10.9 or 10.99  ,
                        but not 10.999 ).

                     minNumberOfExecutedThings -> (integer)
                        The minimum number of things that receive the configu-
                        ration before the job can cancel.

          timeoutConfig -> (structure)
              The timeout configuration for the job.  This  configuration  de-
              fines the amount of time each device has to complete the job.

              inProgressTimeoutInMinutes -> (long)
                 The amount of time, in minutes, that devices have to complete
                 the job. The timer starts when  the  job  status  is  set  to
                 IN_PROGRESS  . If the job status doesn't change to a terminal
                 state before the time expires, then the job status is set  to
                 TIMED_OUT .

                 The  timeout  interval  must  be  between 1 minute and 7 days
                 (10080 minutes).

       creationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
          The time at which the deployment was created, expressed in ISO  8601
          format.
