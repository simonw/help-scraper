BATCH-DISASSOCIATE-CLIENT-DBATCH-DISASSOCIATE-CLIENT-DEVICE-FROM-CORE-DEVICE()



NAME
       batch-disassociate-client-device-from-core-device -

DESCRIPTION
       Disassociates  a  list  of client devices from a core device. After you
       disassociate a client device from a  core  device,  the  client  device
       won't be able to use cloud discovery to retrieve the core device's con-
       nectivity information and certificates.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-disassociate-client-device-from-core-device
          [--entries <value>]
          --core-device-thing-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --entries (list)
          The list of client devices to disassociate.

          (structure)
              Contains a request to disassociate a client device from  a  core
              device.  The  BatchDisassociateClientDeviceWithCoreDevice opera-
              tion consumes a list of these requests.

              thingName -> (string)
                 The name of the IoT thing that represents the  client  device
                 to disassociate.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          thingName=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "thingName": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --core-device-thing-name (string)
          The name of the core device. This is also the name of the IoT thing.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To disassociate client devices from a core device

       The following batch-disassociate-client-device-from-core-device example
       disassociates two client devices from a core device.

          aws greengrassv2 batch-disassociate-client-device-from-core-device \
            --core-device-thing-name MyGreengrassCore \
            --entries thingName=MyClientDevice1 thingName=MyClientDevice2

       Output:

          {
              "errorEntries": []
          }

       For more information, see Interact with local IoT devices  in  the  AWS
       IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       errorEntries -> (list)
          The  list  of  any errors for the entries in the request. Each error
          entry contains the name of the IoT thing that failed  to  disassoci-
          ate.

          (structure)
              Contains  an  error that occurs from a request to disassociate a
              client     device     from     a      core      device.      The
              BatchDisassociateClientDeviceWithCoreDevice  operation returns a
              list of these errors.

              thingName -> (string)
                 The name of the IoT thing whose disassociate request failed.

              code -> (string)
                 The error code for the request.

              message -> (string)
                 A message that provides additional information about the  er-
                 ror.
