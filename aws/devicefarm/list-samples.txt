LIST-SAMPLES()                                                  LIST-SAMPLES()



NAME
       list-samples -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about samples, given an AWS Device Farm job ARN.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-samples is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: samples

SYNOPSIS
            list-samples
          --arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job used to list samples.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       samples -> (list)
          Information about the samples.

          (structure)
              Represents a sample of performance data.

              arn -> (string)
                 The sample's ARN.

              type -> (string)
                 The sample's type.

                 Must be one of the following values:

                 o CPU:  A  CPU sample type. This is expressed as the app pro-
                   cessing CPU time (including child processes) as reported by
                   process, as a percentage.

                 o MEMORY:  A  memory  usage sample type. This is expressed as
                   the total proportional set size of an app process, in kilo-
                   bytes.

                 o NATIVE_AVG_DRAWTIME

                 o NATIVE_FPS

                 o NATIVE_FRAMES

                 o NATIVE_MAX_DRAWTIME

                 o NATIVE_MIN_DRAWTIME

                 o OPENGL_AVG_DRAWTIME

                 o OPENGL_FPS

                 o OPENGL_FRAMES

                 o OPENGL_MAX_DRAWTIME

                 o OPENGL_MIN_DRAWTIME

                 o RX

                 o RX_RATE: The total number of bytes per second (TCP and UDP)
                   that are sent, by app process.

                 o THREADS: A threads sample type. This is  expressed  as  the
                   total number of threads per app process.

                 o TX

                 o TX_RATE: The total number of bytes per second (TCP and UDP)
                   that are received, by app process.

              url -> (string)
                 The presigned Amazon S3 URL that can be used with a  GET  re-
                 quest to download the sample's file.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  the  number  of  items that are returned is significantly large,
          this is an identifier that is also returned. It can  be  used  in  a
          subsequent call to this operation to return the next set of items in
          the list.
