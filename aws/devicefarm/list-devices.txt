NAME
       list-devices -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about unique device types.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-devices is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: devices

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the project.

       --filters (list)
          Used to select a set of devices. A filter is made up  of  an  attri-
          bute, an operator, and one or more values.

          o Attribute:  The  aspect of a device such as platform or model used
            as the selection criteria in a device filter. Allowed  values  in-
            clude:

            o ARN:  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device (for example,
              arn:aws:devicefarm:us-west-2::device:12345Example ).

            o PLATFORM: The device platform. Valid values are ANDROID or IOS.

            o OS_VERSION: The operating system version (for example, 10.3.2).

            o MODEL: The device model (for example, iPad 5th Gen).

            o AVAILABILITY: The current availability of the device. Valid val-
              ues   are   AVAILABLE,   HIGHLY_AVAILABLE,   BUSY,   or   TEMPO-
              RARY_NOT_AVAILABLE.

            o FORM_FACTOR: The device form factor. Valid values are  PHONE  or
              TABLET.

            o REMOTE_ACCESS_ENABLED:  Whether the device is enabled for remote
              access. Valid values are TRUE or FALSE.

            o REMOTE_DEBUG_ENABLED: Whether the device is enabled  for  remote
              debugging. Valid values are TRUE or FALSE. Because remote debug-
              ging is no longer supported , this attribute is ignored.

            o INSTANCE_ARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  device  in-
              stance.

            o INSTANCE_LABELS: The label of the device instance.

            o FLEET_TYPE: The fleet type. Valid values are PUBLIC or PRIVATE.

          o Operator: The filter operator.

            o The  EQUALS operator is available for every attribute except IN-
              STANCE_LABELS.

            o The CONTAINS operator is available for the  INSTANCE_LABELS  and
              MODEL attributes.

            o The  IN  and NOT_IN operators are available for the ARN, OS_VER-
              SION, MODEL, MANUFACTURER, and INSTANCE_ARN attributes.

            o The   LESS_THAN,    GREATER_THAN,    LESS_THAN_OR_EQUALS,    and
              GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUALS  operators  are  also  available  for the
              OS_VERSION attribute.

          o Values: An array of one or more filter values.

            o The IN and NOT_IN operators take a values array that has one  or
              more elements.

            o The other operators require an array with a single element.

            o In  a  request,  the  AVAILABILITY attribute takes the following
              values:   AVAILABLE,   HIGHLY_AVAILABLE,   BUSY,    or    TEMPO-
              RARY_NOT_AVAILABLE.

          (structure)
              Represents a device filter used to select a set of devices to be
              included in a test run. This data structure is passed in as  the
              deviceSelectionConfiguration  parameter  to ScheduleRun . For an
              example of the JSON request syntax, see  ScheduleRun .

              It is also passed in as the filters parameter to  ListDevices  .
              For an example of the JSON request syntax, see  ListDevices .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attribute=string,operator=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "attribute": "ARN"|"PLATFORM"|"OS_VERSION"|"MODEL"|"AVAILABILITY"|"FORM_FACTOR"|"MANUFACTURER"|"REMOTE_ACCESS_ENABLED"|"REMOTE_DEBUG_ENABLED"|"INSTANCE_ARN"|"INSTANCE_LABELS"|"FLEET_TYPE",

            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
