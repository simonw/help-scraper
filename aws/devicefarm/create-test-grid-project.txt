       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-test-grid-project
          --name <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--vpc-config <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Human-readable name of the Selenium testing project.

       --description (string)
          Human-readable description of the project.

       --vpc-config (structure)
          The VPC security groups and subnets that are attached to a project.

          securityGroupIds -> (list)
              A list of VPC security group IDs in your Amazon VPC.

              (string)

          subnetIds -> (list)
              A list of VPC subnet IDs in your Amazon VPC.

              (string)

          vpcId -> (string)
              The ID of the Amazon VPC.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          securityGroupIds=string,string,subnetIds=string,string,vpcId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "securityGroupIds": ["string", ...],
            "subnetIds": ["string", ...],
            "vpcId": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
