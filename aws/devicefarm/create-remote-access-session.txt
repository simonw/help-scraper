OPTIONS
       --project-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the project for which you want to
          create a remote access session.

       --device-arn (string)
          The ARN of the device for which you want to create a  remote  access
          session.

       --instance-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device instance for which you
          want to create a remote access session.

       --ssh-public-key (string)
          Ignored. The public key of the ssh key pair you want to use for con-
          necting to remote devices in your remote debugging session. This key
          is required only if remoteDebugEnabled is set to true .

          Remote debugging is no longer supported .

       --remote-debug-enabled | --no-remote-debug-enabled (boolean)
          Set to true if you want to access devices remotely for debugging  in
          your remote access session.

          Remote debugging is no longer supported .

       --remote-record-enabled | --no-remote-record-enabled (boolean)
          Set  to  true  to enable remote recording for the remote access ses-
          sion.

       --remote-record-app-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the app to be recorded in the re-
          mote access session.

       --name (string)
          The name of the remote access session to create.

       --client-id (string)
          Unique identifier for the client. If you want access to multiple de-
          vices on the same client, you should pass the same clientId value in
          each call to CreateRemoteAccessSession . This identifier is required
          only if remoteDebugEnabled is set to true .

          Remote debugging is no longer supported .

       --configuration (structure)
          The configuration information for the remote access session request.

          billingMethod -> (string)
              The billing method for the remote access session.

          vpceConfigurationArns -> (list)
              An array of ARNs included in the VPC endpoint configuration.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          billingMethod=string,vpceConfigurationArns=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "billingMethod": "METERED"|"UNMETERED",
            "vpceConfigurationArns": ["string", ...]
          }

       --interaction-mode (string)
          The interaction mode of the remote access session. Valid values are:

          o INTERACTIVE: You can interact with  the  iOS  device  by  viewing,
            touching,  and rotating the screen. You cannot run XCUITest frame-
            work-based tests in this mode.

          o NO_VIDEO: You are connected to the  device,  but  cannot  interact
            with  it or view the screen. This mode has the fastest test execu-
            tion speed. You can run XCUITest  framework-based  tests  in  this
            mode.

          o VIDEO_ONLY:  You  can  view the screen, but cannot touch or rotate
            it. You can run  XCUITest  framework-based  tests  and  watch  the
            screen in this mode.

          Possible values:

          o INTERACTIVE

          o NO_VIDEO

          o VIDEO_ONLY

       --skip-app-resign | --no-skip-app-resign (boolean)
          When  set  to  true , for private devices, Device Farm does not sign
          your app again. For public devices, Device Farm  always  signs  your
          apps again.

          For more information on how Device Farm modifies your uploads during
          tests, see Do you modify my app?

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
