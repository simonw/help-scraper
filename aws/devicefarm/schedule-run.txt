          CreateUpload . See  ListUploads .

       --device-pool-arn (string)
          The ARN of the device pool for the run to be scheduled.

       --device-selection-configuration (structure)
          The filter criteria used to dynamically select a set of devices  for
          a  test  run and the maximum number of devices to be included in the
          run.

          Either ** devicePoolArn ** or ** deviceSelectionConfiguration **  is
          required in a request.

          filters -> (list)
              Used  to  dynamically  select a set of devices for a test run. A
              filter is made up of an attribute, an operator, and one or  more
              values.

              o Attribute    The  aspect of a device such as platform or model
                used as the selection criteria in  a  device  filter.  Allowed
                values include:

                o ARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device (for exam-
                  ple, arn:aws:devicefarm:us-west-2::device:12345Example ).

                o PLATFORM: The device platform. Valid values are  ANDROID  or
                  IOS.

                o OS_VERSION:  The  operating  system  version  (for  example,
                  10.3.2).

                o MODEL: The device model (for example, iPad 5th Gen).

                o AVAILABILITY: The current availability of the device.  Valid
                  values  are  AVAILABLE,  HIGHLY_AVAILABLE,  BUSY,  or TEMPO-
                  RARY_NOT_AVAILABLE.

                o FORM_FACTOR: The device form factor. Valid values are  PHONE
                  or TABLET.

                o MANUFACTURER: The device manufacturer (for example, Apple).

                o REMOTE_ACCESS_ENABLED: Whether the device is enabled for re-
                  mote access. Valid values are TRUE or FALSE.

                o REMOTE_DEBUG_ENABLED: Whether the device is enabled for  re-
                  mote  debugging. Valid values are TRUE or FALSE. Because re-
                  mote debugging is no longer supported , this filter  is  ig-
                  nored.

                o INSTANCE_ARN:  The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device
                  instance.

                o INSTANCE_LABELS: The label of the device instance.

                o FLEET_TYPE: The fleet type. Valid values are PUBLIC or  PRI-
                  VATE.

              o Operator   The filter operator.

                o The  EQUALS operator is available for every attribute except
                  INSTANCE_LABELS.

                o The CONTAINS operator is available for  the  INSTANCE_LABELS
                  and MODEL attributes.

                o The  IN  and  NOT_IN  operators  are  available for the ARN,
                  OS_VERSION,  MODEL,  MANUFACTURER,  and   INSTANCE_ARN   at-
                  tributes.

                o The   LESS_THAN,   GREATER_THAN,   LESS_THAN_OR_EQUALS,  and
                  GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUALS operators are also available for  the
                  OS_VERSION attribute.

              o Values   An array of one or more filter values.  Operator Val-
                ues

                o The IN and NOT_IN operators can take a values array that has
                  more than one element.

                o The other operators require an array with a single element.
                 Attribute Values

                     o The PLATFORM attribute can be set to ANDROID or IOS.

                     o The  AVAILABILITY  attribute  can  be set to AVAILABLE,
                       HIGHLY_AVAILABLE, BUSY, or TEMPORARY_NOT_AVAILABLE.

                       TABLET.

                     o The  FLEET_TYPE  attribute can be set to PUBLIC or PRI-
                       VATE.

              (structure)
                 Represents a device filter used to select a set of devices to
                 be  included  in a test run. This data structure is passed in
                 as the deviceSelectionConfiguration parameter to  ScheduleRun
                 . For an example of the JSON request syntax, see  ScheduleRun
                 .

                 It is also passed in as the filters parameter to  ListDevices

              of strings.

              For all tests:

              o app_performance_monitoring : Performance monitoring is enabled
                by default. Set this parameter to false to disable it.

              For Appium tests (all types):

              o appium_version: The Appium version. Currently supported values
                are 1.6.5 (and later), latest, and default.

                o latest  runs  the  latest Appium version supported by Device
                  Farm (1.9.1).

                o For default, Device Farm selects a compatible version of Ap-
                  pium for the device. The current behavior is to run 1.7.2 on
                  Android devices and iOS 9 and earlier and 1.7.2 for  iOS  10
                  and later.

                the UI fuzz test should perform.

              o throttle: The time, in ms, between 0 and  1000,  that  the  UI
                fuzz test should wait between events.

              o seed:  A  seed  to use for randomizing the UI fuzz test. Using
                the same seed value between tests ensures identical event  se-
                quences.

              For Instrumentation:

              o filter: A test filter string. Examples:

                o Running a single test case: com.android.abc.Test1

                o Running a single test: com.android.abc.Test1#smoke

              For XCTest and XCTestUI:

              o filter: A test filter string. Examples:

                o Running a single test class: LoginTests

                o Running a multiple test classes: LoginTests,SmokeTests

                o Running a single test: LoginTests/testValid

              is metered .

              NOTE:

                 this parameter to unmetered to make use of  them.  Otherwise,
                 your run counts against your metered time.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-

       the string will be taken literally.
