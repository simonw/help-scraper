GET-DEVICE-POOL()                                            GET-DEVICE-POOL()



NAME
       get-device-pool -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about a device pool.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-device-pool
          --arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The device pool's ARN.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 operator -> (string)
                     Specifies  how  Device Farm compares the rule's attribute
                     to the value. For the operators  that  are  supported  by
                     each attribute, see the attribute descriptions.

                 value -> (string)
                     The rule's value.

          maxDevices -> (integer)
              The  number  of  devices that Device Farm can add to your device
              pool. Device Farm adds devices that are available and  meet  the
              criteria  that  you assign for the rules parameter. Depending on
              how many devices meet these constraints, your device pool  might
              contain fewer devices than the value for this parameter.

              By specifying the maximum number of devices, you can control the
              costs that you incur by running tests.
