          testPackageArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the uploaded test to be run.

          testSpecArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the YAML-formatted test specification.

          filter -> (string)
              The test's filter.

          parameters -> (map)
              The  test's  parameters,  such  as test framework parameters and
              fixture settings. Parameters are represented by name-value pairs
              of strings.

              For all tests:

              o app_performance_monitoring : Performance monitoring is enabled
                by default. Set this parameter to false to disable it.

              For Calabash tests:

              o profile: A cucumber profile (for example, my_profile_name ).

              o tags: You can limit execution to features  or  scenarios  that
                have  (or  don't  have)  certain  tags (for example, @smoke or
                @smoke,~@wip).

              For Appium tests (all types):

              o appium_version: The Appium version. Currently supported values
                are 1.6.5 (and later), latest, and default.

                o latest  runs  the  latest Appium version supported by Device
                  Farm (1.9.1).

                o For default, Device Farm selects a compatible version of Ap-
                  pium for the device. The current behavior is to run 1.7.2 on
                  Android devices and iOS 9 and earlier and 1.7.2 for  iOS  10
                  and later.

                o This behavior is subject to change.

              For fuzz tests (Android only):

              o event_count:  The  number of events, between 1 and 10000, that
                the UI fuzz test should perform.

              o throttle: The time, in ms, between 0 and  1000,  that  the  UI
                fuzz test should wait between events.

              o seed:  A  seed  to use for randomizing the UI fuzz test. Using
                the same seed value between tests ensures identical event  se-
                quences.

              For Explorer tests:

              o username:  A user name to use if the Explorer encounters a lo-
                gin form. If not supplied, no user name is inserted.

              o password: A password to use if the Explorer encounters a login
                form. If not supplied, no password is inserted.

              For Instrumentation:

              o filter: A test filter string. Examples:

                o Running a single test case: com.android.abc.Test1

                o Running a single test: com.android.abc.Test1#smoke

                o Running    multiple   tests:   com.android.abc.Test1,com.an-
                  droid.abc.Test2

              For XCTest and XCTestUI:

              o filter: A test filter string. Examples:

                o Running a single test class: LoginTests

                o Running a multiple test classes: LoginTests,SmokeTests

                o Running a single test: LoginTests/testValid

                o Running    multiple    tests:    LoginTests/testValid,Login-
                  Tests/testInvalid

              For UIAutomator:

              o filter: A test filter string. Examples:

                o Running a single test case: com.android.abc.Test1

                o Running a single test: com.android.abc.Test1#smoke

                o Running    multiple   tests:   com.android.abc.Test1,com.an-

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
