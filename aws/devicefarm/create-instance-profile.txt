SYNOPSIS
            create-instance-profile
          --name <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--package-cleanup | --no-package-cleanup]
          [--exclude-app-packages-from-cleanup <value>]
          [--reboot-after-use | --no-reboot-after-use]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of your instance profile.

       --description (string)
          The description of your instance profile.

       --package-cleanup | --no-package-cleanup (boolean)
          When set to true , Device Farm removes app  packages  after  a  test
          run. The default value is false for private devices.

       --exclude-app-packages-from-cleanup (list)
          An  array  of  strings  that specifies the list of app packages that
          should not be cleaned up from the device after a test run.

          The list of packages is considered only if you set packageCleanup to
          true .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --reboot-after-use | --no-reboot-after-use (boolean)
          When  set  to  true  , Device Farm reboots the instance after a test
          run. The default value is true .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          packageCleanup -> (boolean)

              An  array  of  strings  containing the list of app packages that
