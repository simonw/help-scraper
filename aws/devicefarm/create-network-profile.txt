OPTIONS
       --project-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the project for which you want to
          create a network profile.

       --name (string)
          The name for the new network profile.

       --description (string)
          The description of the network profile.

       --type (string)
          The type of network profile to create. Valid values are listed here.

          Possible values:

          o CURATED

          o PRIVATE

       --uplink-bandwidth-bits (long)
          The data throughput rate in bits per second, as an integer from 0 to
          104857600.

       --downlink-bandwidth-bits (long)
          The data throughput rate in bits per second, as an integer from 0 to
          104857600.

       --uplink-delay-ms (long)
          Delay time for all packets to destination in milliseconds as an  in-
          teger from 0 to 2000.

       --downlink-delay-ms (long)
          Delay  time for all packets to destination in milliseconds as an in-
          teger from 0 to 2000.

       --uplink-jitter-ms (long)
          Time variation in the delay of received packets in  milliseconds  as
          an integer from 0 to 2000.

       --downlink-jitter-ms (long)
          Time  variation  in the delay of received packets in milliseconds as
          an integer from 0 to 2000.

       --uplink-loss-percent (integer)
          Proportion of transmitted packets that fail to arrive from 0 to  100
          percent.

       --downlink-loss-percent (integer)
          Proportion  of  received  packets  that fail to arrive from 0 to 100
          percent.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
