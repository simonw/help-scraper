       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON

       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not

       the string will be taken literally.

       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
