DESCRIPTION
       Updates an uploaded test spec.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-upload
          --arn <value>
          [--name <value>]
          [--content-type <value>]
          [--edit-content | --no-edit-content]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the uploaded test spec.

       --name (string)
          The upload's test spec file name. The name must not contain any for-
          ward slashes (/). The test spec file name must end with the .yaml or
          .yml file extension.

       --content-type (string)
          The upload's content type (for example, application/x-yaml ).

       --edit-content | --no-edit-content (boolean)
          Set to true if the YAML file has changed and must be updated. Other-
          wise, set to false.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
