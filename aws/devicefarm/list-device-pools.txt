LIST-DEVICE-POOLS()                                        LIST-DEVICE-POOLS()



NAME
       list-device-pools -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about device pools.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-device-pools  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: devicePools

SYNOPSIS
            list-device-pools
          --arn <value>
          [--type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The project ARN.

       --type (string)
          The device pools' type.

          Allowed values include:

          o CURATED: A device pool that is created and managed by  AWS  Device
            Farm.

          o PRIVATE:  A  device pool that is created and managed by the device
            pool developer.

          Possible values:

          o CURATED

          o PRIVATE

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     operator -> (string)
                        Specifies  how  Device Farm compares the rule's attri-
                        bute to the value. For the  operators  that  are  sup-
                        ported  by  each attribute, see the attribute descrip-
                        tions.

                     value -> (string)
                        The rule's value.

              maxDevices -> (integer)
                 The number of devices that Device Farm can add to your device
                 pool.  Device  Farm  adds devices that are available and meet
                 the criteria that you assign for the rules parameter. Depend-
                 ing  on  how many devices meet these constraints, your device
                 pool might contain fewer devices than the value for this  pa-
                 rameter.

                 By  specifying the maximum number of devices, you can control
                 the costs that you incur by running tests.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If the number of items that are  returned  is  significantly  large,
          this  is  an  identifier  that is also returned. It can be used in a
          subsequent call to this operation to return the next set of items in
          the list.
