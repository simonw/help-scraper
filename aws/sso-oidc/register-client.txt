REGISTER-CLIENT()                                            REGISTER-CLIENT()



NAME
       register-client -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers a client with Amazon Web Services SSO. This allows clients to
       initiate device authorization. The output should be persisted for reuse
       through many authentication requests.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            register-client
          --client-name <value>
          --client-type <value>
          [--scopes <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-name (string)
          The friendly name of the client.

       --client-type (string)
          The  type  of  client.  The service supports only public as a client
          type. Anything other than public will be rejected by the service.

       --scopes (list)
          The list of scopes that are defined by the client.  Upon  authoriza-
          tion, this list is used to restrict permissions when granting an ac-
          cess token.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       clientId -> (string)

          identifier to get authenticated by the service in subsequent calls.

       clientSecret -> (string)
          A secret string generated for the client. The client will  use  this
          string to get authenticated by the service in subsequent calls.

       clientIdIssuedAt -> (long)
          Indicates  the  time at which the clientId and clientSecret were is-
          sued.

       clientSecretExpiresAt -> (long)
          Indicates the time at which the clientId and clientSecret  will  be-
          come invalid.

       authorizationEndpoint -> (string)
          The endpoint where the client can request authorization.

       tokenEndpoint -> (string)
          The endpoint where the client can get an access token.
