DELETE-POLICY()                                                DELETE-POLICY()



NAME
       delete-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the specified managed policy.

       Before  you can delete a managed policy, you must first detach the pol-
       icy from all users, groups, and roles that it is attached to. In  addi-
       tion,  you  must  delete all the policy's versions. The following steps
       describe the process for deleting a managed policy:

       o Detach the policy from all users, groups, and roles that  the  policy
         is  attached  to,  using   DetachUserPolicy ,  DetachGroupPolicy , or
         DetachRolePolicy . To list all the users, groups, and  roles  that  a
         policy is attached to, use  ListEntitiesForPolicy .

       o Delete  all  versions  of  the policy using  DeletePolicyVersion . To
         list the policy's versions, use  ListPolicyVersions . You cannot  use
         DeletePolicyVersion  to  delete the version that is marked as the de-
         fault version. You delete the policy's default version  in  the  next
         step of the process.

       o Delete  the  policy  (this automatically deletes the policy's default
         version) using this operation.

       For information about managed policies, see Managed policies and inline
       policies in the IAM User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-policy
          --policy-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM policy you want to delete.

          For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
          the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete an IAM policy

       This    example     deletes     the     policy     whose     ARN     is
       arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/MySamplePolicy:

          aws iam delete-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/MySamplePolicy
