CREATE-SERVICE-LINKED-ROLE()                      CREATE-SERVICE-LINKED-ROLE()



NAME
       create-service-linked-role -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  IAM  role that is linked to a specific Amazon Web Services
       service. The service controls the attached policies and when  the  role
       can  be deleted. This helps ensure that the service is not broken by an
       unexpectedly changed or deleted role, which could put your  Amazon  Web
       Services  resources into an unknown state. Allowing the service to con-
       trol the role helps improve service stability and proper cleanup when a
       service  and  its  role are no longer needed. For more information, see
       Using service-linked roles in the IAM User Guide .

       To attach a policy to this service-linked role, you must make  the  re-
       quest using the Amazon Web Services service that depends on this role.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-service-linked-role
          --aws-service-name <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--custom-suffix <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --aws-service-name (string)
          The  service  principal for the Amazon Web Services service to which
          this role is attached. You use a string similar to a URL but without
          the http:// in front. For example: elasticbeanstalk.amazonaws.com .

          Service  principals are unique and case-sensitive. To find the exact
          service principal for your service-linked role, see Amazon Web  Ser-
          vices  services  that work with IAM in the IAM User Guide . Look for
          the services that have Yes in the Service-Linked Role column. Choose
          the  Yes link to view the service-linked role documentation for that
          service.

       --description (string)
          The description of the role.

       --custom-suffix (string)
          A string that you provide, which is combined with  the  service-pro-
          vided  prefix  to  form the complete role name. If you make multiple
          requests for the same service, then you must supply a different Cus-
          tomSuffix  for  each request. Otherwise the request fails with a du-
          plicate role name error. For example, you could add -1 or -debug  to
          the suffix.

          Some services do not support the CustomSuffix parameter. If you pro-
          vide an optional suffix and the operation fails, try  the  operation
          again without the suffix.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a service-linked role

       The   following   create-service-linked-role  example  creates  a  ser-
       vice-linked role for the specified AWS service and attaches the  speci-
       fied description.

          aws iam create-service-linked-role \
              --aws-service-name lex.amazonaws.com \
              --description "My service-linked role to support Lex"

              rameter or duration-seconds CLI parameter.

          PermissionsBoundary -> (structure)
              The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions  boundary  for
              the role.

              Guide .

              (structure)
                 A structure that represents user-provided metadata  that  can
                 be  associated  with  an  IAM  resource. For more information
                 about tagging, see Tagging IAM  resources  in  the  IAM  User
                 Guide .

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the
                     associated value. For example, Department or Cost  Center
                     are common choices.

                     The  value  associated  with  this tag. For example, tags
                     with a key name of Department could have values  such  as
                     Human  Resources , Accounting , and Support . Tags with a
                     key name of Cost Center might have values that consist of
                     the  number associated with the different cost centers in
                     your company. Typically, many resources  have  tags  with
                     the same key name but with different values.

                     NOTE:
                        Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag Value as
                        a single string. If you need to store  an  array,  you
                        can  store  comma-separated values in the string. How-
                        ever, you must interpret the value in your code.

          RoleLastUsed -> (structure)
              Contains information about the last time that an  IAM  role  was
              used.  This  includes  the date and time and the Region in which
              the role was last used. Activity is only reported for the trail-
              ing  400  days.  This period can be shorter if your Region began
              supporting these features within the last year. The  role  might
              have been used more than 400 days ago. For more information, see
              Regions where data is tracked in the IAM User Guide .

              LastUsedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format that the role
                 was last used.

                 This  field  is null if the role has not been used within the
                 IAM tracking period. For more information about the  tracking
                 period,  see  Regions  where  data is tracked in the IAM User
                 Guide .

              Region -> (string)
                 The name of the Amazon Web Services Region in which the  role
                 was last used.
