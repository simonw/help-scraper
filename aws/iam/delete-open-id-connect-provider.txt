DELETE-OPEN-ID-CONNECT-PROVIDER()            DELETE-OPEN-ID-CONNECT-PROVIDER()



NAME
       delete-open-id-connect-provider -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  an  OpenID  Connect identity provider (IdP) resource object in
       IAM.

       Deleting an IAM OIDC provider resource does not update any  roles  that
       reference  the provider as a principal in their trust policies. Any at-
       tempt to assume a role that references a deleted provider fails.

       This operation is idempotent; it does not fail or return  an  error  if
       you call the operation for a provider that does not exist.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-open-id-connect-provider
          --open-id-connect-provider-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --open-id-connect-provider-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the IAM OpenID Connect provider
          resource object to delete. You can get  a  list  of  OpenID  Connect
          provider  resource ARNs by using the  ListOpenIDConnectProviders op-
          eration.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
