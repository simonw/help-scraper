LIST-POLICIES-GRANTING-SERVICE-ACCESS()LIST-POLICIES-GRANTING-SERVICE-ACCESS()



NAME
       list-policies-granting-service-access -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  list  of  policies that the IAM identity (user, group, or
       role) can use to access each specified service.

       NOTE:
          This operation does not use  other  policy  types  when  determining
          whether  a resource could access a service. These other policy types
          include resource-based policies, access control lists, Organizations
          policies,  IAM permissions boundaries, and STS assume role policies.
          It only applies permissions policy logic. For more about the evalua-
          tion  of policy types, see Evaluating policies in the IAM User Guide
          .

       The list of policies returned by the operation depends on  the  ARN  of
       the identity that you provide.

       o User   The  list of policies includes the managed and inline policies
         that are attached to the user directly. The list  also  includes  any
         additional managed and inline policies that are attached to the group
         to which the user belongs.

       o Group  The list of policies includes  only  the  managed  and  inline
         policies  that  are attached to the group directly. Policies that are
         attached to the groups user are not included.

       o Role  The list of policies includes only the managed and inline poli-
         cies that are attached to the role.

       For  each  managed  policy,  this  operation returns the ARN and policy
       name. For each inline policy, it returns the policy name and the entity
       to  which  it is attached. Inline policies do not have an ARN. For more
       information about these policy types, see Managed policies  and  inline
       policies in the IAM User Guide .

       Policies that are attached to users and roles as permissions boundaries
       are not returned. To view which managed policy is currently used to set
       the  permissions boundary for a user or role, use the  GetUser or  Get-
       Role operations.

SYNOPSIS
            list-policies-granting-service-access
          [--marker <value>]
          --arn <value>
          --service-namespaces <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --marker (string)
          Use this parameter only when paginating results and only  after  you
          receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it
          to the value of the Marker element in the response that you received
          to indicate where the next call should start.

       --arn (string)
          The  ARN  of  the IAM identity (user, group, or role) whose policies
          you want to list.

       --service-namespaces (list)
          The service namespace for the Amazon  Web  Services  services  whose
          policies you want to list.

          To  learn  the  service  namespace  for  a service, see Actions, re-
          sources, and condition keys for Amazon Web Services services in  the
          IAM  User Guide . Choose the name of the service to view details for
          that service. In the first paragraph, find the service  prefix.  For
          example,  (service prefix: a4b) . For more information about service
          namespaces, see Amazon Web Services service namespaces in the Amazon
          Web Services General Reference .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  list  the  policies  that grant a principal access to the specified
       service

       The following list-policies-granting-service-access  example  retrieves
       the  list of policies that grant the IAM user sofia access to AWS Code-
       Commit service.

          aws iam list-policies-granting-service-access \
              --arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/sofia \
              --service-namespaces codecommit

       Output:

          {
              "PoliciesGrantingServiceAccess": [
                  {
                      "ServiceNamespace": "codecommit",
                      "Policies": [
                          {
                              "PolicyName": "Grant-Sofia-Access-To-CodeCommit",
                              "PolicyType": "INLINE",
                              "EntityType": "USER",
                              "EntityName": "sofia"
                          }
                      ]
                  }
              ],
              "IsTruncated": false
          }

OUTPUT
       PoliciesGrantingServiceAccess -> (list)
          A  ListPoliciesGrantingServiceAccess  object  that  contains details
          about the permissions policies attached to  the  specified  identity
          (user, group, or role).

          (structure)
              Contains  details  about  the  permissions policies that are at-
              tached to the specified identity (user, group, or role).

              This data type is used as a response element in  the   ListPoli-
              ciesGrantingServiceAccess operation.

              ServiceNamespace -> (string)
                 The namespace of the service that was accessed.

                 To learn the service namespace of a service, see Actions, re-
                 sources, and condition keys for Amazon Web Services  services
                 in  the  Service Authorization Reference . Choose the name of
                 the service to view details for that service.  In  the  first
                 paragraph,  find  the  service  prefix. For example, (service
                 prefix: a4b) . For more information about service namespaces,
                 see  Amazon Web Services service namespaces in the Amazon Web
                 Services General Reference .

                     Contains  details about the permissions policies that are
                     attached to  the  specified  identity  (user,  group,  or
                     role).

                     This  data  type is an element of the  ListPoliciesGrant-
                     ingServiceAccessEntry object.

                     PolicyName -> (string)
                        The policy name.

                     PolicyType -> (string)
                        The policy type. For more information about these pol-
                        icy types, see Managed policies and inline policies in
                        the IAM User Guide .

                     PolicyArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN). ARNs are unique  iden-
                        tifiers for Amazon Web Services resources.

                        For more information about ARNs, go to Amazon Resource
                        Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Refer-
                        ence .

                     EntityType -> (string)
                        The type of entity (user or role) that used the policy
                        to access the service to which the  inline  policy  is
                        attached.

                        This  field is null for managed policies. For more in-
                        formation about these policy types, see Managed  poli-
                        cies and inline policies in the IAM User Guide .

                     EntityName -> (string)
                        The name of the entity (user or role) to which the in-
                        line policy is attached.

                        This field is null for managed policies. For more  in-
                        formation  about these policy types, see Managed poli-
                        cies and inline policies in the IAM User Guide .

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more  items  to  return.  If
          your  results  were  truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination
          request using the Marker request parameter to retrieve  more  items.
          We  recommend  that you check IsTruncated after every call to ensure
          that you receive all your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains  the
          value to use for the Marker parameter in a subsequent pagination re-
          quest.
