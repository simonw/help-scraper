UPLOAD-SSH-PUBLIC-KEY()                                UPLOAD-SSH-PUBLIC-KEY()



NAME
       upload-ssh-public-key -

DESCRIPTION
       Uploads  an  SSH  public  key  and associates it with the specified IAM
       user.

       The SSH public key uploaded by this operation can be used only for  au-
       thenticating  the  associated IAM user to an CodeCommit repository. For
       more information about using SSH keys to authenticate to an  CodeCommit
       repository, see Set up CodeCommit for SSH connections in the CodeCommit
       User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            upload-ssh-public-key
          --user-name <value>
          --ssh-public-key-body <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The name of the IAM user to associate the SSH public key with.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --ssh-public-key-body (string)
          The SSH public key. The public key must be encoded in ssh-rsa format
          or PEM format. The minimum bit-length of  the  public  key  is  2048
          bits.  For example, you can generate a 2048-bit key, and the result-
          ing PEM file is 1679 bytes long.

          The regex pattern used to validate this parameter  is  a  string  of
          characters consisting of the following:

          o Any  printable  ASCII  character  ranging from the space character
            (\u0020 ) through the end of the ASCII character range

          o The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement
            character set (through \u00FF )

          o The  special  characters  tab  (\u0009 ), line feed (\u000A ), and
            carriage return (\u000D )

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To upload an SSH public key and associate it with a user

       The  following  upload-ssh-public-key  command  uploads  the public key
       found in the file 'sshkey.pub' and attaches it to the user 'sofia'.

          aws iam upload-ssh-public-key --user-name sofia --ssh-public-key-body file://sshkey.pub

       Output:

          {
              "SSHPublicKey": {
                  "UserName": "sofia",
                  "SSHPublicKeyId": "APKA1234567890EXAMPLE",
                  "Fingerprint": "12:34:56:78:90:ab:cd:ef:12:34:56:78:90:ab:cd:ef",
                  "SSHPublicKeyBody": "ssh-rsa <<long string generated by ssh-keygen command>>",
                  "Status": "Active",
                  "UploadDate": "2019-04-18T17:04:49+00:00"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       SSHPublicKey -> (structure)
          Contains information about the SSH public key.

          UserName -> (string)
              The name of the IAM user associated with the SSH public key.

          SSHPublicKeyId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the SSH public key.

          Fingerprint -> (string)
              The MD5 message digest of the SSH public key.

          SSHPublicKeyBody -> (string)
              The SSH public key.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the SSH public key. Active means that the key  can
              be  used for authentication with an CodeCommit repository. Inac-
              tive means that the key cannot be used.

          UploadDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when  the  SSH
              public key was uploaded.
