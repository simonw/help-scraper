CREATE-SERVICE-SPECIFIC-CREDENTIAL()      CREATE-SERVICE-SPECIFIC-CREDENTIAL()



NAME
       create-service-specific-credential -

DESCRIPTION
       Generates  a  set of credentials consisting of a user name and password
       that can be used to access the service specified in the request.  These
       credentials  are  generated by IAM, and can be used only for the speci-
       fied service.

       You can have a maximum of two sets of service-specific credentials  for
       each supported service per user.

       You  can  create service-specific credentials for CodeCommit and Amazon
       Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra).

       You can reset the password to a new service-generated value by  calling
       ResetServiceSpecificCredential .

       For  more information about service-specific credentials, see Using IAM
       with CodeCommit: Git credentials, SSH keys, and Amazon Web Services ac-
       cess keys in the IAM User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-service-specific-credential
          --user-name <value>
          --service-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The  name  of the IAM user that is to be associated with the creden-
          tials. The new service-specific credentials have  the  same  permis-
          sions  as  the  associated user except that they can be used only to
          access the specified service.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --service-name (string)
          The name of the Amazon Web Services service that is to be associated
          with the credentials. The service you specify here is the only  ser-
          vice that can be accessed using these credentials.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Create a set of service-specific credentials for a user

       The  following  create-service-specific-credential  example  creates  a
       username and password that can be used to access  only  the  configured
       service.

          aws iam create-service-specific-credential --user-name sofia --service-name codecommit.amazonaws.com

       Output:

          {
              "ServiceSpecificCredential": {
                  "CreateDate": "2019-04-18T20:45:36+00:00",
                  "ServiceName": "codecommit.amazonaws.com",
                  "ServiceUserName": "sofia-at-123456789012",
                  "ServicePassword": "k1zPZM6uVxMQ3oxqgoYlNuJPyRTZ1vREs76zTQE3eJk=",
                  "ServiceSpecificCredentialId": "ACCAEXAMPLE123EXAMPLE",
                  "UserName": "sofia",
                  "Status": "Active"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       ServiceSpecificCredential -> (structure)
          A structure that contains information about the newly  created  ser-
          vice-specific credential.

          WARNING:
              This  is the only time that the password for this credential set
              is available. It cannot be recovered later.  Instead,  you  must
              reset the password with  ResetServiceSpecificCredential .

          CreateDate -> (timestamp)
              The  date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when the ser-
              vice-specific credential were created.

          ServiceName -> (string)
              The name of the service  associated  with  the  service-specific
              credential.

          ServiceUserName -> (string)
              The  generated  user  name  for the service-specific credential.
              This value is generated by combining the IAM  user's  name  com-
              bined  with the ID number of the Amazon Web Services account, as
              in jane-at-123456789012 , for example. This value cannot be con-
              figured by the user.

          ServicePassword -> (string)
              The generated password for the service-specific credential.

          ServiceSpecificCredentialId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the service-specific credential.

          UserName -> (string)
              The  name  of  the IAM user associated with the service-specific
              credential.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the service-specific credential. Active means that
              the key is valid for API calls, while Inactive means it is not.
