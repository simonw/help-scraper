ATTACH-GROUP-POLICY()                                    ATTACH-GROUP-POLICY()



NAME
       attach-group-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Attaches the specified managed policy to the specified IAM group.

       You  use this operation to attach a managed policy to a group. To embed
       an inline policy in a group, use  PutGroupPolicy .

       As a best practice, you can validate your IAM policies. To learn  more,
       see Validating IAM policies in the IAM User Guide .

       For  more  information  about policies, see Managed policies and inline
       policies in the IAM User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            attach-group-policy
          --group-name <value>
          --policy-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --group-name (string)
          The name (friendly name, not ARN) of the group to attach the  policy
          to.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters consisting of upper  and  lowercase  alphanumeric  characters
          with  no  spaces.  You can also include any of the following charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --policy-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM policy you want to attach.

          For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
          the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To attach a managed policy to an IAM group

       The following attach-group-policy command attaches the AWS managed pol-
       icy named ReadOnlyAccess to the IAM group named Finance:

          aws iam attach-group-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess --group-name Finance

       For more information, see Managed Policies and Inline Policies  in  the
       Using IAM guide.

OUTPUT
