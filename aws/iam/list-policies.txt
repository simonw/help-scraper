LIST-POLICIES()                                                LIST-POLICIES()



NAME
       list-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  the  managed policies that are available in your Amazon Web
       Services account, including your own customer-defined managed  policies
       and all Amazon Web Services managed policies.

       You can filter the list of policies that is returned using the optional
       OnlyAttached , Scope , and PathPrefix parameters. For example, to  list
       only the customer managed policies in your Amazon Web Services account,
       set Scope to Local . To list only Amazon Web Services managed policies,
       set Scope to AWS .

       You can paginate the results using the MaxItems and Marker parameters.

       For  more  information about managed policies, see Managed policies and
       inline policies in the IAM User Guide .

       NOTE:
          IAM resource-listing operations return a subset of the available at-
          tributes  for the resource. For example, this operation does not re-
          turn tags, even though they are an attribute of the returned object.
          To  view  all  of  the information for a customer manged policy, see
          GetPolicy .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-policies is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Policies

SYNOPSIS
            list-policies
          [--scope <value>]
          [--only-attached | --no-only-attached]
          [--path-prefix <value>]
          [--policy-usage-filter <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --scope (string)
          The scope to use for filtering the results.

          To  list only Amazon Web Services managed policies, set Scope to AWS
          . To list only the customer managed policies in your Amazon Web Ser-
          vices account, set Scope to Local .

          This  parameter  is optional. If it is not included, or if it is set
          to All , all policies are returned.

          Possible values:

          o All

          o AWS

          o Local

       --only-attached | --no-only-attached (boolean)
          A flag to filter the results to only the attached policies.

          When OnlyAttached is true , the  returned  list  contains  only  the
          policies  that  are  attached  to  an IAM user, group, or role. When
          OnlyAttached is false , or when the parameter is not  included,  all
          policies are returned.

       --path-prefix (string)
          The  path  prefix  for  filtering the results. This parameter is op-
          tional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash  (/),  listing
          all  policies.  This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a
          string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by it-
          self  or  a  string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In
          addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the  !  (\u0021  )
          through  the  DEL  character  (\u007F  ), including most punctuation
          characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

       --policy-usage-filter (string)
          The policy usage method to use for filtering the results.

          To list only permissions policies, set PolicyUsageFilter to  Permis-
          sionsPolicy  .  To  list  only  the policies used to set permissions
          boundaries, set the value to PermissionsBoundary .

          This parameter is optional. If it is not included, all policies  are
          returned.

          Possible values:

          o PermissionsPolicy

          o PermissionsBoundary

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Policies -> (list)
          A list of policies.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a managed policy.

              This data type is used as a response element in the   CreatePol-
              icy ,  GetPolicy , and  ListPolicies operations.

              For  more  information  about managed policies, refer to Managed
              policies and inline policies in the IAM User Guide .

              PolicyName -> (string)

              PolicyId -> (string)
                 The stable and unique string identifying the policy.

                 For more information about IDs, see IAM  identifiers  in  the
                 IAM User Guide .

              Arn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN). ARNs are unique identifiers
                 for Amazon Web Services resources.

                 For more information about ARNs, go to Amazon Resource  Names
                 (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

              Path -> (string)
                 The path to the policy.

                 For  more information about paths, see IAM identifiers in the
                 IAM User Guide .

              DefaultVersionId -> (string)
                 The identifier for the version of the policy that is  set  as
                 the default version.

              AttachmentCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  entities (users, groups, and roles) that the
                 policy is attached to.

              PermissionsBoundaryUsageCount -> (integer)
                 The number of entities (users and roles) for which the policy
                 is used to set the permissions boundary.

                 For   more  information  about  permissions  boundaries,  see
                 Permissions boundaries for IAM identities  in  the  IAM  User
                 Guide .

              IsAttachable -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether the policy can be attached to an IAM user,
                 group, or role.

              Description -> (string)
                 A friendly description of the policy.

                 This element is included in the response  to  the   GetPolicy
                 operation.  It  is not included in the response to the  List-
                 Policies operation.

              CreateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format  ,  when  the
                 policy was created.

              UpdateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when the
                 policy was last updated.

                 When a policy has only one version, this field  contains  the
                 date  and time when the policy was created. When a policy has
                 more than one version, this field contains the date and  time
                 when the most recent policy version was created.

              Tags -> (list)
                 A list of tags that are attached to the instance profile. For
                 more information about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources  in
                 the IAM User Guide .

                 (structure)
                     A  structure  that represents user-provided metadata that
                     can be associated with an IAM resource. For more informa-
                     tion  about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM
                     User Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key name that can be used to look up  or  retrieve
                        the  associated value. For example, Department or Cost
                        Center are common choices.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value associated with this tag. For example,  tags
                        with  a  key name of Department could have values such
                        as Human Resources , Accounting , and Support  .  Tags
                        with  a key name of Cost Center might have values that
                        consist of the number associated  with  the  different
                        cost  centers  in  your  company.  Typically, many re-
                        sources have tags with the same key name but with dif-
                        ferent values.

                        NOTE:
                            Amazon  Web  Services  always  interprets  the tag
                            Value as a single string. If you need to store  an
                            array, you can store comma-separated values in the
                            string. However, you must interpret the  value  in
                            your code.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A  flag  that  indicates  whether there are more items to return. If
          your results were truncated, you can make  a  subsequent  pagination
          request  using  the Marker request parameter to retrieve more items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even  when  there  are more results available. We recommend that you
          check IsTruncated after every call to ensure that  you  receive  all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When  IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains the
          value to use for the Marker parameter in a subsequent pagination re-
          quest.
