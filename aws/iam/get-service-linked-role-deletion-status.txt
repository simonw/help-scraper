GET-SERVICE-LINKED-ROLE-DELETION-STATGET-SERVICE-LINKED-ROLE-DELETION-STATUS()



NAME
       get-service-linked-role-deletion-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  status  of your service-linked role deletion. After you
       use  DeleteServiceLinkedRole to submit a service-linked role for  dele-
       tion,  you  can  use  the  DeletionTaskId parameter in GetServiceLinke-
       dRoleDeletionStatus to check the status of the deletion. If  the  dele-
       tion  fails,  this operation returns the reason that it failed, if that
       information is returned by the service.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-service-linked-role-deletion-status
          --deletion-task-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --deletion-task-id (string)
          The deletion task identifier. This identifier  is  returned  by  the
          DeleteServiceLinkedRole   operation   in  the  format  task/aws-ser-
          vice-role/<service-principal-name>/<role-name>/<task-uuid> .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To check the status of a request to delete a service-linked role

       The  following get-service-linked-role-deletion-status example displays
       the status of a previously request to delete a service-linked role. The
       delete  operation occurs asynchronously. When you make the request, you
       get a DeletionTaskId value that you provide as  a  parameter  for  this
       command.

          aws iam get-service-linked-role-deletion-status --deletion-task-id task/aws-service-role/lex.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForLexBots/1a2b3c4d-1234-abcd-7890-abcdeEXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
            "Status": "SUCCEEDED"
          }

       Guide

OUTPUT
       Status -> (string)
          The status of the deletion.

       Reason -> (structure)
          An object that  contains  details  about  the  reason  the  deletion
          failed.

          Reason -> (string)
              A  short  description of the reason that the service-linked role
              deletion failed.

          RoleUsageList -> (list)
              A list of objects that contains details about the service-linked
              role  deletion  failure,  if that information is returned by the
              service. If the service-linked role has active  sessions  or  if
              any  resources  that were used by the role have not been deleted
              from the linked service, the role can't be deleted. This parame-
              ter  includes  a  list of the resources that are associated with
              the role and the Region in which the resources are being used.

              (structure)
                 An object that contains details about  how  a  service-linked
                 role is used, if that information is returned by the service.

                 This  data type is used as a response element in the  GetSer-
                 viceLinkedRoleDeletionStatus operation.

                 Region -> (string)
                     The name of the Region where the service-linked  role  is
                     being used.

                 Resources -> (list)
                     The name of the resource that is using the service-linked
                     role.

                     (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN). ARNs are unique  iden-
                        tifiers for Amazon Web Services resources.

                        For more information about ARNs, go to Amazon Resource

                        ence .
