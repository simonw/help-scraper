GET-POLICY-VERSION()                                      GET-POLICY-VERSION()



NAME
       get-policy-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about the specified version of the specified man-
       aged policy, including the policy document.

       NOTE:
          Policies returned by this operation are URL-encoded  compliant  with
          RFC  3986  . You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy
          back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you  can  use
          the  decode  method  of the java.net.URLDecoder utility class in the
          Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

       To list the available versions for a policy, use  ListPolicyVersions .

       This operation retrieves information about  managed  policies.  To  re-
       trieve  information  about an inline policy that is embedded in a user,
       group, or role, use  GetUserPolicy ,  GetGroupPolicy , or   GetRolePol-
       icy .

       For  more information about the types of policies, see Managed policies
       and inline policies in the IAM User Guide .

       For more information about managed policy versions, see Versioning  for
       managed policies in the IAM User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            get-policy-version
          --policy-arn <value>
          --version-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the managed policy that you want
          information about.

          For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
          the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       --version-id (string)
          Identifies the policy version to retrieve.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters that consists of the lowercase letter 'v' followed by one  or
          two  digits, and optionally followed by a period '.' and a string of
          letters and digits.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  retrieve  information  about the specified version of the specified
       managed policy

       This example returns the policy document for the v2 version of the pol-
       icy whose ARN is arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/MyManagedPolicy:

          aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/MyPolicy --version-id v2

       Output:

          {
              "PolicyVersion": {
                  "CreateDate": "2015-06-17T19:23;32Z",
                  "VersionId": "v2",
                  "Document": {
                                "Version": "2012-10-17",
                                "Statement": [
                                        {
                                                "Action": "iam:*",
                                                "Resource": "*",
                                                "Effect": "Allow"
                                        }
                                ]
                          }
                  "IsDefaultVersion": "false"
              }
          }

       guide.

OUTPUT
       PolicyVersion -> (structure)
          A structure containing details about the policy version.

          Document -> (string)
              The policy document.

              The policy document is returned in the response to the  GetPoli-
              cyVersion  and  GetAccountAuthorizationDetails operations. It is
              not returned in the  response  to  the   CreatePolicyVersion  or
              ListPolicyVersions operations.

              The  policy  document  returned in this structure is URL-encoded
              compliant with RFC 3986 . You can use a URL decoding  method  to
              convert  the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you
              use Java, you can use the decode method of  the  java.net.URLDe-
              coder  utility  class  in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs
              provide similar functionality.

          VersionId -> (string)
              The identifier for the policy version.

              Policy version identifiers always begin with  v  (always  lower-
              case).  When a policy is created, the first policy version is v1
              .

          IsDefaultVersion -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the policy version is set as the policy's  de-
              fault version.

          CreateDate -> (timestamp)
              The  date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when the pol-
              icy version was created.
