SIMULATE-CUSTOM-POLICY()                              SIMULATE-CUSTOM-POLICY()



NAME
       simulate-custom-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Simulate how a set of IAM policies and optionally a resource-based pol-
       icy works with a list of API operations and  Amazon  Web  Services  re-
       sources  to determine the policies' effective permissions. The policies
       are provided as strings.

       The simulation does not perform the API operations; it only checks  the
       authorization  to determine if the simulated policies allow or deny the
       operations. You can simulate resources that don't  exist  in  your  ac-
       count.

       If  you  want to simulate existing policies that are attached to an IAM
       user, group, or role, use  SimulatePrincipalPolicy instead.

       Context keys are variables that are maintained by Amazon  Web  Services
       and  its services and which provide details about the context of an API
       query request. You can use the Condition element of an  IAM  policy  to
       evaluate  context  keys. To get the list of context keys that the poli-
       cies require for correct simulation, use  GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy
       .

       If  the  output  is long, you can use MaxItems and Marker parameters to
       paginate the results.

       For more information about using the policy simulator, see Testing  IAM
       policies with the IAM policy simulator in the IAM User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       simulate-custom-policy is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: EvaluationResults

OPTIONS
       --policy-input-list (list)
          A list of policy documents to include in the simulation. Each  docu-
          ment  is  specified  as a string containing the complete, valid JSON
          text of an IAM policy. Do not include any resource-based policies in
          this parameter. Any resource-based policy must be submitted with the
          ResourcePolicy parameter. The policies cannot be "scope-down"  poli-
          cies,  such  as you could include in a call to GetFederationToken or
          one of the AssumeRole API operations. In other  words,  do  not  use
          policies  designed  to  restrict  what a user can do while using the
          temporary credentials.

          The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in  this
          operation,  including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maxi-
          mum character counts of a managed policy with  no  whitespaces,  see
          IAM and STS character quotas .

          The  regex  pattern  used  to validate this parameter is a string of
          characters consisting of the following:

          o Any printable ASCII character ranging  from  the  space  character
            (\u0020 ) through the end of the ASCII character range

          o The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement
            character set (through \u00FF )

          o The special characters tab (\u0009 ), line  feed  (\u000A  ),  and
            carriage return (\u000D )

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --permissions-boundary-policy-input-list (list)
          The  IAM  permissions  boundary  policy to simulate. The permissions
          boundary sets the maximum permissions that an IAM entity  can  have.
          You  can  input only one permissions boundary when you pass a policy
          to this operation. For more  information  about  permissions  bound-
          aries,  see  Permissions boundaries for IAM entities in the IAM User
          Guide . The policy input is specified as a string that contains  the
          complete, valid JSON text of a permissions boundary policy.

          The  maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this
          operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the  maxi-
          mum  character  counts  of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see
          IAM and STS character quotas .

          The regex pattern used to validate this parameter  is  a  string  of
          characters consisting of the following:

          o Any  printable  ASCII  character  ranging from the space character
            (\u0020 ) through the end of the ASCII character range

          o The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement
            character set (through \u00FF )

          o The  special  characters  tab  (\u0009 ), line feed (\u000A ), and
            carriage return (\u000D )

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --action-names (list)
          A list of names of API operations to  evaluate  in  the  simulation.
          Each  operation  is  evaluated against each resource. Each operation
          must include the service identifier, such as iam:CreateUser  .  This
          operation does not support using wildcards (*) in an action name.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --resource-arns (list)
          A  list  of  ARNs of Amazon Web Services resources to include in the
          simulation. If this parameter is not provided, then  the  value  de-
          faults  to  * (all resources). Each API in the ActionNames parameter
          is evaluated for each resource in this list. The  simulation  deter-
          mines  the access result (allowed or denied) of each combination and
          reports it in the response. You can simulate  resources  that  don't
          exist in your account.

          The  simulation  does  not  automatically  retrieve policies for the
          specified resources. If you want to include a resource policy in the
          simulation,  then you must include the policy as a string in the Re-
          sourcePolicy parameter.

          If you include a ResourcePolicy , then it must be applicable to  all
          of  the  resources  included in the simulation or you receive an in-
          valid input error.

          For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
          the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --resource-policy (string)
          A  resource-based  policy to include in the simulation provided as a
          string. Each resource in the simulation is treated as if it had this
          policy attached. You can include only one resource-based policy in a
          simulation.

          The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in  this
          operation,  including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maxi-
          mum character counts of a managed policy with  no  whitespaces,  see
          IAM and STS character quotas .

          The  regex  pattern  used  to validate this parameter is a string of
          characters consisting of the following:

          o Any printable ASCII character ranging  from  the  space  character
            (\u0020 ) through the end of the ASCII character range

          o The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement
            character set (through \u00FF )

          o The special characters tab (\u0009 ), line  feed  (\u000A  ),  and
            carriage return (\u000D )

       --resource-owner (string)
          An  ARN  representing the Amazon Web Services account ID that speci-
          fies the owner of any simulated resource that does not identify  its
          owner  in  the resource ARN. Examples of resource ARNs include an S3
          bucket or object. If ResourceOwner is specified, it is also used  as
          the  account owner of any ResourcePolicy included in the simulation.
          If the ResourceOwner parameter is not specified, then the  owner  of
          the resources and the resource policy defaults to the account of the
          identity provided in CallerArn . This parameter is required only  if
          you  specify  a  resource-based policy and account that owns the re-
          source is different from the account that owns the simulated calling
          user CallerArn .

          The    ARN    for    an   account   uses   the   following   syntax:
          arn:aws:iam::*AWS-account-ID* :root . For example, to represent  the
          account   with   the   112233445566   ID,  use  the  following  ARN:
          arn:aws:iam::112233445566-ID:root .

       --caller-arn (string)
          The ARN of the IAM user that you want to use as the simulated caller
          of  the  API  operations. CallerArn is required if you include a Re-
          sourcePolicy so that the policy's Principal element has a  value  to
          use in evaluating the policy.

          You  can specify only the ARN of an IAM user. You cannot specify the
          ARN of an assumed role, federated user, or a service principal.

       --context-entries (list)
          A list of context keys and corresponding values for  the  simulation
          to  use. Whenever a context key is evaluated in one of the simulated
          IAM permissions policies, the corresponding value is supplied.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a condition context key. It  includes
              the  name  of the key and specifies the value (or values, if the
              context key supports multiple values) to use in the  simulation.
              This  information is used when evaluating the Condition elements
              of the input policies.

              This data type is used as an input parameter to  SimulateCustom-
              Policy and  SimulatePrincipalPolicy .

              ContextKeyName -> (string)
                 The  full name of a condition context key, including the ser-
                 vice prefix. For example, aws:SourceIp or s3:VersionId .

              ContextKeyValues -> (list)
                 The value (or values, if the condition context  key  supports
                 multiple values) to provide to the simulation when the key is
                 referenced by a Condition element in an input policy.

                 (string)

              ContextKeyType -> (string)
                 The data type of the value (or values) specified in the  Con-
                 textKeyValues parameter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ContextKeyName=string,ContextKeyValues=string,string,ContextKeyType=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ContextKeyName": "string",
              "ContextKeyValues": ["string", ...],
              "ContextKeyType": "string"|"stringList"|"numeric"|"numericList"|"boolean"|"booleanList"|"ip"|"ipList"|"binary"|"binaryList"|"date"|"dateList"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --resource-handling-option (string)
          Specifies  the  type  of simulation to run. Different API operations
          that support resource-based policies require different  combinations
          of  resources.  By specifying the type of simulation to run, you en-
          able the policy simulator to enforce the presence  of  the  required
          resources  to ensure reliable simulation results. If your simulation
          does not match one of the following scenarios,  then  you  can  omit
          this  parameter. The following list shows each of the supported sce-
          nario values and the resources that you must define to run the simu-
          lation.

          Each of the EC2 scenarios requires that you specify instance, image,
          and security-group resources. If your scenario includes an EBS  vol-
          ume,  then  you  must  specify that volume as a resource. If the EC2
          scenario includes VPC, then you must  supply  the  network-interface
          resource.  If  it  includes  an IP subnet, then you must specify the
          subnet resource. For more information on the EC2  scenario  options,
          see Supported platforms in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

          o EC2-Classic-InstanceStore   instance, image, security-group

          o EC2-Classic-EBS   instance, image, security-group, volume

          o EC2-VPC-InstanceStore     instance,  image,  security-group,  net-
            work-interface

          o EC2-VPC-InstanceStore-Subnet    instance,  image,  security-group,
            network-interface, subnet

          o EC2-VPC-EBS    instance, image, security-group, network-interface,
            volume

          o EC2-VPC-EBS-Subnet   instance, image, security-group,  network-in-
            terface, subnet, volume

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To simulate the effects of all IAM policies associated with an IAM user
       or role

       The following simulate-custom-policy shows how to provide both the pol-
       icy and define variable values and simulate an API call to see if it is
       allowed  or  denied.  The following example shows a policy that enables
       database access only after a specified date and  time.  The  simulation
       succeeds  because  the simulated actions and the specified aws:Current-
       Time variable all match the requirements of the policy.

          aws iam simulate-custom-policy \
              --policy-input-list '{"Version":"2012-10-17","Statement":{"Effect":"Allow","Action":"dynamodb:*","Resource":"*","Condition":{"DateGreaterThan":{"aws:CurrentTime":"2018-08-16T12:00:00Z"}}}}' \
              --action-names dynamodb:CreateBackup \
              --context-entries "ContextKeyName='aws:CurrentTime',ContextKeyValues='2019-04-25T11:00:00Z',ContextKeyType=date"

       Output:

          {
              "EvaluationResults": [
                  {
                      "EvalActionName": "dynamodb:CreateBackup",
                      "EvalResourceName": "*",
                      "EvalDecision": "allowed",
                      "MatchedStatements": [
                          {
                              "SourcePolicyId": "PolicyInputList.1",
                              "StartPosition": {
                                  "Line": 1,
                                  "Column": 38
                              },
                              "EndPosition": {
                                  "Line": 1,
                                  "Column": 167
                              }
                          }
                      ],
                      "MissingContextValues": []
                  }
              ]
          }

       The following simulate-custom-policy example shows the results of simu-
       lating a command that is prohibited by the policy. In this example, the
       provided date is before that required by the policy's condition.

          aws iam simulate-custom-policy \
              --policy-input-list '{"Version":"2012-10-17","Statement":{"Effect":"Allow","Action":"dynamodb:*","Resource":"*","Condition":{"DateGreaterThan":{"aws:CurrentTime":"2018-08-16T12:00:00Z"}}}}' \
              --action-names dynamodb:CreateBackup \
              --context-entries "ContextKeyName='aws:CurrentTime',ContextKeyValues='2014-04-25T11:00:00Z',ContextKeyType=date"

       Output:

          {
              "EvaluationResults": [
                  {
                      "EvalActionName": "dynamodb:CreateBackup",
                      "EvalResourceName": "*",
                      "EvalDecision": "implicitDeny",
                      "MatchedStatements": [],
                      "MissingContextValues": []
                  }
              ]
          }

       ulator in the AWS IAM User Guide

OUTPUT
       EvaluationResults -> (list)
          The results of the simulation.

          (structure)
              Contains the results of a simulation.

              This  data type is used by the return parameter of ``  Simulate-
              CustomPolicy `` and ``  SimulatePrincipalPolicy `` .

              EvalActionName -> (string)
                 The name of the API operation tested  on  the  indicated  re-
                 source.

              EvalResourceName -> (string)
                 The  ARN of the resource that the indicated API operation was
                 tested on.

              EvalDecision -> (string)
                 The result of the simulation.

              MatchedStatements -> (list)
                 A list of the statements in the input policies that determine
                 the  result for this scenario. Remember that even if multiple
                 statements allow the operation on the resource, if  only  one
                 statement denies that operation, then the explicit deny over-
                 rides any allow. In addition, the deny statement is the  only
                 entry included in the result.

                 (structure)
                     Contains  a  reference to a Statement element in a policy
                     document that determines the result of the simulation.

                     This data type is used by the MatchedStatements member of
                     the ``  EvaluationResult `` type.

                     SourcePolicyId -> (string)
                        The  identifier  of the policy that was provided as an
                        input.

                     SourcePolicyType -> (string)
                        The type of the policy.

                     StartPosition -> (structure)
                        The row and column of the beginning of  the  Statement
                        in an IAM policy.

                        Line -> (integer)
                            The  line containing the specified position in the
                            document.

                        Column -> (integer)
                            The column in the line  containing  the  specified
                            position in the document.

                     EndPosition -> (structure)
                        The row and column of the end of a Statement in an IAM
                        policy.

                        Line -> (integer)
                            The line containing the specified position in  the
                            document.

                        Column -> (integer)
                            The  column  in  the line containing the specified
                            position in the document.

              MissingContextValues -> (list)
                 A list of context keys that are required by the included  in-
                 put  policies  but that were not provided by one of the input
                 parameters. This list is used when the resource in a  simula-
                 tion  is "*", either explicitly, or when the ResourceArns pa-
                 rameter blank. If you include a list of resources,  then  any
                 missing  context  values  are  instead included under the Re-
                 sourceSpecificResults section. To discover the  context  keys
                 used  by  a set of policies, you can call  GetContextKeysFor-
                 CustomPolicy or  GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy .

                 (string)

              OrganizationsDecisionDetail -> (structure)
                 A structure that details how Organizations  and  its  service
                 control  policies  affect the results of the simulation. Only
                 applies if the simulated user's account is part of an organi-
                 zation.

                 AllowedByOrganizations -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  the simulated operation is allowed by
                     the Organizations service control  policies  that  impact
                     the simulated user's account.

              PermissionsBoundaryDecisionDetail -> (structure)
                 Contains  information  about  the  effect  that a permissions
                 boundary has on a policy simulation when the boundary is  ap-
                 plied to an IAM entity.

                 AllowedByPermissionsBoundary -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  an action is allowed by a permissions
                     boundary that is applied to an IAM entity (user or role).
                     A  value of true means that the permissions boundary does
                     not deny the action. This means that the policy  includes
                     an  Allow  statement  that  matches  the request. In this
                     case, if an identity-based policy also allows the action,
                     the  request  is allowed. A value of false means that ei-
                     ther the requested action is not allowed (implicitly  de-
                     nied) or that the action is explicitly denied by the per-
                     missions boundary. In both of these cases, the action  is
                     not allowed, regardless of the identity-based policy.

              EvalDecisionDetails -> (map)
                 Additional  details  about  the  results of the cross-account
                 evaluation decision. This parameter  is  populated  for  only
                 cross-account simulations. It contains a brief summary of how
                 each policy type contributes to the  final  evaluation  deci-
                 sion.

                 If  the simulation evaluates policies within the same account
                 and includes a resource ARN, then the  parameter  is  present
                 but  the response is empty. If the simulation evaluates poli-
                 cies within the same account and specifies all  resources  (*
                 ), then the parameter is not returned.

                 When  you  make  a cross-account request, Amazon Web Services
                 evaluates the request in the trusting account and the trusted
                 account.  The request is allowed only if both evaluations re-
                 turn true . For more information about how policies are eval-
                 uated, see Evaluating policies within a single account .

                 If an Organizations SCP included in the evaluation denies ac-
                 cess, the simulation ends. In this  case,  policy  evaluation
                 does  not  proceed  any further and this parameter is not re-
                 turned.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              ResourceSpecificResults -> (list)
                 The individual results of the simulation of the API operation
                 specified in EvalActionName on each resource.

                 (structure)
                     Contains the result of the simulation of a single API op-
                     eration call on a single resource.

                     This data type is used by a member of the   EvaluationRe-
                     sult data type.

                     EvalResourceName -> (string)
                        The name of the simulated resource, in Amazon Resource
                        Name (ARN) format.

                     EvalResourceDecision -> (string)
                        The result of the simulation of the simulated API  op-
                        eration  on the resource specified in EvalResourceName
                        .

                     MatchedStatements -> (list)
                        A list of the statements in the  input  policies  that
                        determine  the result for this part of the simulation.
                        Remember that even if multiple  statements  allow  the
                        operation  on  the  resource,  if any statement denies
                        that operation, then the explicit deny  overrides  any
                        allow. In addition, the deny statement is the only en-
                        try included in the result.

                        (structure)
                            Contains a reference to a Statement element  in  a
                            policy  document that determines the result of the
                            simulation.

                            This data type is used  by  the  MatchedStatements
                            member of the ``  EvaluationResult `` type.

                            SourcePolicyId -> (string)
                               The  identifier of the policy that was provided
                               as an input.

                            SourcePolicyType -> (string)
                               The type of the policy.

                            StartPosition -> (structure)
                               The row and column  of  the  beginning  of  the
                               Statement in an IAM policy.

                               Line -> (integer)
                                   The  line containing the specified position
                                   in the document.

                               Column -> (integer)
                                   The column in the line containing the spec-
                                   ified position in the document.

                            EndPosition -> (structure)
                               The row and column of the end of a Statement in
                               an IAM policy.

                               Line -> (integer)
                                   The line containing the specified  position
                                   in the document.

                               Column -> (integer)
                                   The column in the line containing the spec-
                                   ified position in the document.

                     MissingContextValues -> (list)
                        A list of context keys that are required  by  the  in-
                        cluded  input  policies  but that were not provided by
                        one of the input parameters. This list is used when  a
                        list of ARNs is included in the ResourceArns parameter
                        instead of "*". If you do not specify  individual  re-
                        sources,  by setting ResourceArns to "*" or by not in-
                        cluding the ResourceArns parameter, then  any  missing
                        context  values are instead included under the Evalua-
                        tionResults section. To discover the context keys used
                        by a set of policies, you can call  GetContextKeysFor-
                        CustomPolicy or  GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy .

                        (string)

                     EvalDecisionDetails -> (map)
                        Additional details about the results of the evaluation
                        decision  on  a single resource. This parameter is re-
                        turned only for cross-account simulations. This param-
                        eter  explains how each policy type contributes to the
                        resource-specific evaluation decision.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (string)

                     PermissionsBoundaryDecisionDetail -> (structure)
                        Contains information about the effect that  a  permis-
                        sions  boundary  has  on a policy simulation when that
                        boundary is applied to an IAM entity.

                        AllowedByPermissionsBoundary -> (boolean)
                            Specifies whether an action is allowed by  a  per-
                            missions boundary that is applied to an IAM entity
                            (user or role). A value of  true  means  that  the
                            permissions  boundary  does  not  deny the action.
                            This means  that  the  policy  includes  an  Allow
                            statement  that matches the request. In this case,
                            if an identity-based policy also  allows  the  ac-
                            tion,  the  request  is  allowed. A value of false
                            means that either the requested action is not  al-
                            lowed  (implicitly  denied)  or that the action is
                            explicitly denied by the permissions boundary.  In
                            both  of  these  cases, the action is not allowed,
                            regardless of the identity-based policy.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more  items  to  return.  If
          your  results  were  truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination
          request using the Marker request parameter to retrieve  more  items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even when there are more results available. We  recommend  that  you
          check  IsTruncated  after  every call to ensure that you receive all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains  the
          value to use for the Marker parameter in a subsequent pagination re-
          quest.
