GET-CONTEXT-KEYS-FOR-CUSTOM-POLICY()      GET-CONTEXT-KEYS-FOR-CUSTOM-POLICY()



NAME
       get-context-keys-for-custom-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  list  of all of the context keys referenced in the input poli-
       cies. The policies are supplied as a list of one or  more  strings.  To
       get  the context keys from policies associated with an IAM user, group,
       or role, use  GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy .

       Context keys are variables maintained by Amazon Web  Services  and  its
       services  that  provide  details  about the context of an API query re-
       quest. Context keys can be evaluated by testing against a value  speci-
       fied  in an IAM policy. Use GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy to understand
       what key names and values you must supply when you  call   SimulateCus-
       tomPolicy  .  Note that all parameters are shown in unencoded form here
       for clarity but must be URL encoded to be included as a part of a  real
       HTML request.

SYNOPSIS
            get-context-keys-for-custom-policy
          --policy-input-list <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-input-list (list)
          A  list of policies for which you want the list of context keys ref-
          erenced in those policies. Each document is specified  as  a  string
          containing the complete, valid JSON text of an IAM policy.

          The  regex  pattern  used  to validate this parameter is a string of
          characters consisting of the following:

          o Any printable ASCII character ranging  from  the  space  character
            (\u0020 ) through the end of the ASCII character range

          o The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement
            character set (through \u00FF )

          o The special characters tab (\u0009 ), line  feed  (\u000A  ),  and
            carriage return (\u000D )

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example  1:  To  list the context keys referenced by one or more custom
       JSON policies provided as a parameter on the command line

       The following get-context-keys-for-custom-policy  command  parses  each
       supplied  policy and lists the context keys used by those policies. Use
       this command to identify which context key values you  must  supply  to
       successfully  use  the policy simulator commands simulate-custom-policy
       and simulate-custom-policy. You can also retrieve the list  of  context
       keys  used  by  all policies associated by an IAM user or role by using
       the get-context-keys-for-custom-policy command. Parameter  values  that
       begin  with  file://  instruct the command to read the file and use the
       contents as the value for the parameter instead of the  file  name  it-
       self.:

          aws iam get-context-keys-for-custom-policy \
              --policy-input-list '{"Version":"2012-10-17","Statement":{"Effect":"Allow","Action":"dynamodb:*","Resource":"arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/${aws:username}","Condition":{"DateGreaterThan":{"aws:CurrentTime":"2015-08-16T12:00:00Z"}}}}'

       Output:

          {
              "ContextKeyNames": [
                  "aws:username",
                  "aws:CurrentTime"
              ]
          }

       Example  2:  To  list the context keys referenced by one or more custom
       JSON policies provided as a file input

       The following get-context-keys-for-custom-policy command is the same as
       the  previous  example, except that the policies are provided in a file
       instead of as a parameter. Because the command expects a JSON  list  of
       strings, and not a list of JSON structures, the file must be structured
       as follows, although you can collapse it into one one:

          [
              "Policy1",
              "Policy2"
          ]

       So for example, a file that contains the policy from the previous exam-
       ple  must  look  like the following. You must escape each embedded dou-
       ble-quote inside the policy string by preceding it with a backslash ''.

          [ "{\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": {\"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"dynamodb:*\", \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:128716708097:table/${aws:username}\", \"Condition\": {\"DateGreaterThan\": {\"aws:CurrentTime\": \"2015-08-16T12:00:00Z\"}}}}" ]

       This file can then be submitted to the following command:

          aws iam get-context-keys-for-custom-policy --policy-input-list file://policyfile.json

       Output:

          {
              "ContextKeyNames": [
                  "aws:username",
                  "aws:CurrentTime"
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Using the IAM Policy Simulator (AWS  CLI  and
       AWS API) in the Using IAM guide.

OUTPUT
       ContextKeyNames -> (list)
          The list of context keys that are referenced in the input policies.

          (string)
