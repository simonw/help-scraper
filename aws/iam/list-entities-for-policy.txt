LIST-ENTITIES-FOR-POLICY()                          LIST-ENTITIES-FOR-POLICY()



NAME
       list-entities-for-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all IAM users, groups, and roles that the specified managed pol-
       icy is attached to.

       You can use the optional EntityFilter parameter to limit the results to
       a  particular type of entity (users, groups, or roles). For example, to
       list only the roles that are attached to the specified policy, set  En-
       tityFilter to Role .

       You can paginate the results using the MaxItems and Marker parameters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-entities-for-policy  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: PolicyGroups, PolicyUsers, PolicyRoles

SYNOPSIS
            list-entities-for-policy
          --policy-arn <value>
          [--entity-filter <value>]
          [--path-prefix <value>]
          [--policy-usage-filter <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM policy for which you  want
          the versions.

          For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
          the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       --entity-filter (string)
          The entity type to use for filtering the results.

          For example, when EntityFilter is Role , only the roles that are at-
          tached  to  the specified policy are returned. This parameter is op-
          tional. If it is not included, all attached entities (users, groups,
          and roles) are returned. The argument for this parameter must be one
          of the valid values listed below.

          Possible values:

          o User

          o Role

          o Group

          o LocalManagedPolicy

          o AWSManagedPolicy

       --path-prefix (string)
          The path prefix for filtering the results.  This  parameter  is  op-
          tional.  If  it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing
          all entities.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  either  a  forward  slash (/) by itself or a
          string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it
          can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021 ) through the DEL
          character (\u007F ), including most punctuation characters,  digits,
          and upper and lowercased letters.

       --policy-usage-filter (string)
          The policy usage method to use for filtering the results.

          To  list only permissions policies, set PolicyUsageFilter to Permis-
          sionsPolicy . To list only the  policies  used  to  set  permissions
          boundaries, set the value to PermissionsBoundary .

          This  parameter is optional. If it is not included, all policies are
          returned.

          Possible values:

          o PermissionsPolicy

          o PermissionsBoundary

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  list all users, groups, and roles that the specified managed policy
       is attached to

       This example returns a list of IAM groups, roles, and  users  who  have
       the policy arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/TestPolicy attached:

          aws iam list-entities-for-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/TestPolicy

       Output:

          {
            "PolicyGroups": [
              {
                "GroupName": "Admins"
              }
            ],
            "PolicyUsers": [
              {
                "UserName": "Bob"
              }
            ],
            "PolicyRoles": [
              {
                "RoleName": "testRole"
              }
            ],
            "IsTruncated": false
          }

          (structure)
              Contains information about a role that a managed policy  is  at-
              tached to.

              This  data  type is used as a response element in the  ListEnti-
              tiesForPolicy operation.

              For more information about managed policies,  refer  to  Managed
              policies and inline policies in the IAM User Guide .

              RoleName -> (string)

                 information about IDs, see IAM identifiers in  the  IAM  User
                 Guide .

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A  flag  that  indicates  whether there are more items to return. If
          your results were truncated, you can make  a  subsequent  pagination
          request  using  the Marker request parameter to retrieve more items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even  when  there  are more results available. We recommend that you
          check IsTruncated after every call to ensure that  you  receive  all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When  IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains the
          value to use for the Marker parameter in a subsequent pagination re-
          quest.
