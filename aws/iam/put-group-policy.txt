PUT-GROUP-POLICY()                                          PUT-GROUP-POLICY()



NAME
       put-group-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds or updates an inline policy document that is embedded in the spec-
       ified IAM group.

       A user can also have managed policies attached to it. To attach a  man-
       aged     policy     to     a    group,    use    `    AttachGroupPolicy
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_AttachGroupPolicy.html`__
       .    To   create   a   new   managed   policy,   use   `   CreatePolicy
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_CreatePolicy.html`__
       . For information about policies, see Managed policies and inline poli-
       cies in the IAM User Guide .

       For information about the maximum number of inline  policies  that  you
       can embed in a group, see IAM and STS quotas in the IAM User Guide .

       NOTE:
          Because  policy  documents  can be large, you should use POST rather
          than GET when calling PutGroupPolicy . For general information about
          using  the  Query API with IAM, see Making query requests in the IAM
          User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --group-name (string)
          The name of the group to associate the policy with.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-.

       --policy-name (string)
          The name of the policy document.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters consisting of upper  and  lowercase  alphanumeric  characters
          with  no  spaces.  You can also include any of the following charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --policy-document (string)
          The policy document.

          You must provide policies in JSON format in IAM. However, for Cloud-
          Formation templates formatted in YAML, you can provide the policy in
          JSON or YAML format. CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to
          JSON format before submitting it to IAM.

          The  regex  pattern  used  to validate this parameter is a string of
          characters consisting of the following:

          o Any printable ASCII character ranging  from  the  space  character
            (\u0020 ) through the end of the ASCII character range

          o The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement
            character set (through \u00FF )

          o The special characters tab (\u0009 ), line  feed  (\u000A  ),  and
            carriage return (\u000D )

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To add a policy to a group

       The  following  put-group-policy command adds a policy to the IAM group
       named Admins.

          aws iam put-group-policy \
              --group-name Admins \
              --policy-document file://AdminPolicy.json \
              --policy-name AdminRoot

       This command produces no output.

       The policy is defined as a JSON document in the AdminPolicy.json  file.
       (The file name and extension do not have significance.)

       For  more  information,  see  Managing IAM policies in the AWS IAM User
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
