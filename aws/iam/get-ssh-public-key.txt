GET-SSH-PUBLIC-KEY()                                      GET-SSH-PUBLIC-KEY()



NAME
       get-ssh-public-key -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  specified  SSH public key, including metadata about the
       key.

       The SSH public key retrieved by this operation is used only for authen-
       ticating  the associated IAM user to an CodeCommit repository. For more
       information about using SSH  keys  to  authenticate  to  an  CodeCommit
       repository, see Set up CodeCommit for SSH connections in the CodeCommit
       User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-ssh-public-key
          --user-name <value>
          --ssh-public-key-id <value>
          --encoding <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The name of the IAM user associated with the SSH public key.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --ssh-public-key-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the SSH public key.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters that can consist of any upper or lowercased letter or digit.

       --encoding (string)
          Specifies the public key encoding format to use in the response.  To
          retrieve the public key in ssh-rsa format, use SSH . To retrieve the
          public key in PEM format, use PEM .

          Possible values:

          o SSH

          o PEM

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To retrieve an SSH public key attached to an IAM user in SSH
       encoded form

       The  following  get-ssh-public-key  command retrieves the specified SSH
       public key from the IAM user sofia. The output is in SSH encoding.

          aws iam get-ssh-public-key \
              --user-name sofia \
              --ssh-public-key-id APKA123456789EXAMPLE \
              --encoding SSH

       Output:

          {
              "SSHPublicKey": {
                  "UserName": "sofia",
                  "SSHPublicKeyId": "APKA123456789EXAMPLE",
                  "Fingerprint": "12:34:56:78:90:ab:cd:ef:12:34:56:78:90:ab:cd:ef",
                  "SSHPublicKeyBody": "ssh-rsa <<long encoded SSH string>>",
                  "Status": "Inactive",
                  "UploadDate": "2019-04-18T17:04:49+00:00"
              }
          }

       Example 2: To retrieve an SSH public key attached to an IAM user in PEM
       encoded form

       The  following  get-ssh-public-key  command retrieves the specified SSH
       public key from the IAM user 'sofia'. The output is in PEM encoding.

          aws iam get-ssh-public-key \
              --user-name sofia \
              --ssh-public-key-id APKA123456789EXAMPLE \
              --encoding PEM

       Output:

          {
              "SSHPublicKey": {
                  "UserName": "sofia",
                  "SSHPublicKeyId": "APKA123456789EXAMPLE",
                  "Fingerprint": "12:34:56:78:90:ab:cd:ef:12:34:56:78:90:ab:cd:ef",
                  "SSHPublicKeyBody": ""-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n<<long encoded PEM string>>\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n"",
                  "Status": "Inactive",
                  "UploadDate": "2019-04-18T17:04:49+00:00"
              }
          }

          A structure containing details about the SSH public key.

          UserName -> (string)
              The name of the IAM user associated with the SSH public key.

          SSHPublicKeyId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the SSH public key.

          Fingerprint -> (string)
              The MD5 message digest of the SSH public key.

          SSHPublicKeyBody -> (string)
              The SSH public key.

          Status -> (string)
              The  status of the SSH public key. Active means that the key can
              be used for authentication with an CodeCommit repository.  Inac-
