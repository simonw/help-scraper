LIST-SERVICE-SPECIFIC-CREDENTIALS()        LIST-SERVICE-SPECIFIC-CREDENTIALS()



NAME
       list-service-specific-credentials -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about the service-specific credentials associated
       with the specified IAM user. If none exists, the operation  returns  an
       empty list. The service-specific credentials returned by this operation
       are used only for authenticating the IAM user to  a  specific  service.
       For  more  information  about using service-specific credentials to au-
       thenticate to an Amazon Web Services service, see Set  up  service-spe-
       cific credentials in the CodeCommit User Guide.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-service-specific-credentials
          [--user-name <value>]
          [--service-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The name of the user whose service-specific credentials you want in-
          formation about. If this value is not specified, then the  operation
          assumes the user whose credentials are used to call the operation.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters consisting of upper  and  lowercase  alphanumeric  characters
          with  no  spaces.  You can also include any of the following charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --service-name (string)
          Filters the returned results to only those for the specified  Amazon
          Web Services service. If not specified, then Amazon Web Services re-
          turns service-specific credentials for all services.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve a list of credentials

       The following list-service-specific-credentials example lists the  cre-
       dentials  generated for HTTPS access to AWS CodeCommit repositories for
       a user named developer.

          aws iam list-service-specific-credentials \
              --user-name developer \
              --service-name codecommit.amazonaws.com

       Output:

          {
              "ServiceSpecificCredentials": [
                  {
                      "UserName": "developer",
                      "Status": "Inactive",
                      "ServiceUserName": "developer-at-123456789012",
                      "CreateDate": "2019-10-01T04:31:41Z",
                      "ServiceSpecificCredentialId": "ACCAQFODXMPL4YFHP7DZE",
                      "ServiceName": "codecommit.amazonaws.com"
                  },
                  {
                      "UserName": "developer",
                      "Status": "Active",
                      "ServiceUserName": "developer+1-at-123456789012",
                      "CreateDate": "2019-10-01T04:31:45Z",
                      "ServiceSpecificCredentialId": "ACCAQFOXMPL6VW57M7AJP",
                      "ServiceName": "codecommit.amazonaws.com"
                  }
              ]

OUTPUT
       ServiceSpecificCredentials -> (list)

                 is not.

              ServiceUserName -> (string)

              ServiceSpecificCredentialId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the service-specific credential.

              ServiceName -> (string)
                 The  name of the service associated with the service-specific
