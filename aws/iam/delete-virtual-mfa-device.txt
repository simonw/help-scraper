DELETE-VIRTUAL-MFA-DEVICE()                        DELETE-VIRTUAL-MFA-DEVICE()



NAME
       delete-virtual-mfa-device -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a virtual MFA device.

       NOTE:
          You  must  deactivate  a  user's  virtual  MFA device before you can
          delete it. For information about deactivating MFA devices, see   De-
          activateMFADevice .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-virtual-mfa-device
          --serial-number <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --serial-number (string)
          The  serial number that uniquely identifies the MFA device. For vir-
          tual MFA devices, the serial number is the same as the ARN.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: =,.@:/-

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To remove a virtual MFA device

       The  following  delete-virtual-mfa-device command removes the specified
       MFA device from the current account:

          aws iam delete-virtual-mfa-device --serial-number arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/MFATest

       Using IAM guide.

OUTPUT
       None
