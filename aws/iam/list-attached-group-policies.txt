LIST-ATTACHED-GROUP-POLICIES()                  LIST-ATTACHED-GROUP-POLICIES()



NAME
       list-attached-group-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  managed  policies  that  are  attached to the specified IAM
       group.

       An IAM group can also have inline policies embedded with  it.  To  list
       the  inline policies for a group, use  ListGroupPolicies . For informa-
       tion about policies, see Managed policies and inline  policies  in  the
       IAM User Guide .

       You  can paginate the results using the MaxItems and Marker parameters.
       You can use the PathPrefix parameter to limit the list of  policies  to
       only those matching the specified path prefix. If there are no policies
       attached to the specified group (or none that match the specified  path
       prefix), the operation returns an empty list.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-attached-group-policies  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: AttachedPolicies

SYNOPSIS
            list-attached-group-policies
          --group-name <value>
          [--path-prefix <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --group-name (string)
          The name (friendly name, not ARN) of  the  group  to  list  attached
          policies for.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters consisting of upper  and  lowercase  alphanumeric  characters
          with  no  spaces.  You can also include any of the following charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --path-prefix (string)
          The path prefix for filtering the results.  This  parameter  is  op-
          tional.  If  it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing
          all policies.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  either  a  forward  slash (/) by itself or a
          string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it
          can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021 ) through the DEL
          character (\u007F ), including most punctuation characters,  digits,
          and upper and lowercased letters.

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list all managed policies that are attached to the specified group

       This example returns the names and ARNs of the  managed  policies  that
       are attached to the IAM group named Admins in the AWS account:

          aws iam list-attached-group-policies --group-name Admins

       Output:

          {
            "AttachedPolicies": [
              {
                "PolicyName": "AdministratorAccess",
                "PolicyArn": "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess"
              },
              {
                "PolicyName": "SecurityAudit",
                "PolicyArn": "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/SecurityAudit"
              }
            ],
            "IsTruncated": false
          }

       For  more  information,  see  Overview of IAM Policies in the Using IAM
       guide.

OUTPUT
       AttachedPolicies -> (list)
          A list of the attached policies.

          (structure)
              Contains information about an attached policy.

              An attached policy is a managed policy that has been attached to
              a user, group, or role. This data type is used as a response el-
              ement in the  ListAttachedGroupPolicies ,  ListAttachedRolePoli-
              cies ,  ListAttachedUserPolicies , and  GetAccountAuthorization-
              Details operations.

              For more information about managed policies,  refer  to  Managed
              policies and inline policies in the IAM User Guide .

              PolicyName -> (string)
                 The friendly name of the attached policy.

              PolicyArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN). ARNs are unique identifiers
                 for Amazon Web Services resources.

                 For more information about ARNs, go to Amazon Resource  Names
                 (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A  flag  that  indicates  whether there are more items to return. If
          your results were truncated, you can make  a  subsequent  pagination
          request  using  the Marker request parameter to retrieve more items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even  when  there  are more results available. We recommend that you
          check IsTruncated after every call to ensure that  you  receive  all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When  IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains the
          value to use for the Marker parameter in a subsequent pagination re-
          quest.
