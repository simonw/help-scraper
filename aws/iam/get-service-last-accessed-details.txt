GET-SERVICE-LAST-ACCESSED-DETAILS()        GET-SERVICE-LAST-ACCESSED-DETAILS()



NAME
       get-service-last-accessed-details -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  service  last  accessed report that was created using the
       GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails operation. You can use the JobId pa-
       rameter in GetServiceLastAccessedDetails to retrieve the status of your
       report job. When the report is complete, you can retrieve the generated
       report. The report includes a list of Amazon Web Services services that
       the resource (user, group, role, or managed policy) can access.

       NOTE:
          Service last accessed data does not use other policy types when  de-
          termining  whether  a  resource  could access a service. These other
          policy types include resource-based policies, access control  lists,
          Organizations  policies,  IAM permissions boundaries, and STS assume
          role policies. It only applies permissions policy  logic.  For  more
          about the evaluation of policy types, see Evaluating policies in the
          IAM User Guide .

       For each service that the resource could access using permissions poli-
       cies,  the  operation  returns details about the most recent access at-
       tempt. If there was no attempt, the service is listed  without  details
       about  the  most recent attempt to access the service. If the operation
       fails, the GetServiceLastAccessedDetails operation returns  the  reason
       that it failed.

       The GetServiceLastAccessedDetails operation returns a list of services.
       This list includes the number of entities that have attempted to access
       the  service and the date and time of the last attempt. It also returns
       the ARN of the following entity, depending on the resource ARN that you
       used to generate the report:

       o User  Returns the user ARN that you used to generate the report

       o Group  Returns the ARN of the group member (user) that last attempted
         to access the service

       o Role  Returns the role ARN that you used to generate the report

       o Policy  Returns the ARN of the user or role that last used the policy
         to attempt to access the service

       By default, the list is sorted by service namespace.

       If  you  specified  ACTION_LEVEL granularity when you generated the re-
       port, this operation returns service and  action  last  accessed  data.
       This  includes  the  most recent access attempt for each tracked action
       within a service. Otherwise, this operation returns only service data.

       For more information about service and action last accessed  data,  see
       Reducing  permissions  using service last accessed data in the IAM User
       Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            get-service-last-accessed-details
          --job-id <value>
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--marker <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The ID of the request generated by the  GenerateServiceLastAccessed-
          Details  operation.  The  JobId  returned  by GenerateServiceLastAc-
          cessedDetail must be used by the same role within a session,  or  by
          the same user when used to call GetServiceLastAccessedDetail .

       --max-items (integer)
          Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number
          of items you want in the response. If additional items exist  beyond
          the maximum you specify, the IsTruncated response element is true .

          If  you  do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults
          to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results,  even  when  there
          are  more  results available. In that case, the IsTruncated response
          element returns true , and Marker contains a value to include in the
          subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

       --marker (string)
          Use  this  parameter only when paginating results and only after you
          receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it
          to the value of the Marker element in the response that you received
          to indicate where the next call should start.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve a service access report

       The  following  get-service-last-accessed-details  example  retrieves a
       previously generated report that lists the services accessed by IAM en-
       tities.   To  generate  a  report,  use  the  generate-service-last-ac-
       cessed-details command.

          aws iam get-service-last-accessed-details \
              --job-id 2eb6c2b8-7b4c-3xmp-3c13-03b72c8cdfdc

       Output:

          {
              "JobStatus": "COMPLETED",
              "JobCreationDate": "2019-10-01T03:50:35.929Z",
              "ServicesLastAccessed": [
                  ...
                  {
                      "ServiceName": "AWS Lambda",
                      "LastAuthenticated": "2019-09-30T23:02:00Z",
                      "ServiceNamespace": "lambda",
                      "LastAuthenticatedEntity": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/admin",
                      "TotalAuthenticatedEntities": 6
                  },
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       JobStatus -> (string)
          The status of the job.

       JobType -> (string)
          The type of job. Service jobs return  information  about  when  each
          service  was  last  accessed.  Action  jobs also include information
          about when tracked actions within the service were last accessed.

       JobCreationDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format ,  when  the  report
          job was created.

       ServicesLastAccessed -> (list)
          A  ServiceLastAccessed  object  that contains details about the most
          recent attempt to access the service.

          (structure)
              Contains details about the most recent  attempt  to  access  the
              service.

              This data type is used as a response element in the  GetService-
              LastAccessedDetails operation.

              ServiceName -> (string)
                 The name of the service in which access was attempted.

              LastAuthenticated -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when an au-
                 thenticated entity most recently attempted to access the ser-
                 vice. Amazon Web Services does not report unauthenticated re-
                 quests.

                 This field is null if no IAM entities attempted to access the
                 service within the reporting period .

              ServiceNamespace -> (string)
                 The namespace of the service in which access was attempted.

                 To learn the service namespace of a service, see Actions, re-
                 sources,  and condition keys for Amazon Web Services services
                 in the Service Authorization Reference . Choose the  name  of
                 the  service  to  view details for that service. In the first
                 paragraph, find the service  prefix.  For  example,  (service
                 prefix: a4b) . For more information about service namespaces,
                 see Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces in the Amazon  Web
                 Services General Reference .

              LastAuthenticatedEntity -> (string)
                 The  ARN of the authenticated entity (user or role) that last
                 attempted to access the service. Amazon Web Services does not
                 report unauthenticated requests.

                 This field is null if no IAM entities attempted to access the
                 service within the reporting period .

              LastAuthenticatedRegion -> (string)
                 The Region from which the authenticated entity (user or role)
                 last  attempted  to  access  the service. Amazon Web Services
                 does not report unauthenticated requests.

                 This field is null if no IAM entities attempted to access the
                 service within the reporting period .

              TotalAuthenticatedEntities -> (integer)
                 The  total number of authenticated principals (root user, IAM
                 users, or IAM roles) that have attempted to access  the  ser-
                 vice.

                 This  field  is null if no principals attempted to access the
                 service within the reporting period .

              TrackedActionsLastAccessed -> (list)
                 An object that contains details about the most recent attempt
                 to access a tracked action within the service.

                 This  field  is  null  if  there no tracked actions or if the
                 principal  did  not  use  the  tracked  actions  within   the
                 reporting  period . This field is also null if the report was
                 generated at the service level and not the action level.  For
                 more  information, see the Granularity field in  GenerateSer-
                 viceLastAccessedDetails .

                 (structure)
                     Contains details about the most recent attempt to  access
                     an action within the service.

                     This data type is used as a response element in the  Get-
                     ServiceLastAccessedDetails operation.

                        The name of the tracked action to which access was at-
                        tempted.  Tracked  actions are actions that report ac-
                        tivity to IAM.

                     LastAccessedEntity -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN). ARNs are unique  iden-
                        tifiers for Amazon Web Services resources.

                        For more information about ARNs, go to Amazon Resource
                        Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Refer-
                        ence .

                     LastAccessedTime -> (timestamp)
                        The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when
                        an authenticated entity most recently attempted to ac-
                        cess the tracked service. Amazon Web Services does not
                        report unauthenticated requests.

                        This field is null if no IAM entities attempted to ac-
                        cess the service within the reporting period .

                     LastAccessedRegion -> (string)
                        The  Region  from which the authenticated entity (user
                        or role) last attempted to access the tracked  action.
                        Amazon  Web  Services  does not report unauthenticated
                        requests.

                        This field is null if no IAM entities attempted to ac-
                        cess the service within the reporting period .

       JobCompletionDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when the generated
          report job was completed or failed.

          This field is null if the job is still in progress, as indicated  by
          a job status value of IN_PROGRESS .

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A  flag  that  indicates  whether there are more items to return. If
          your results were truncated, you can make  a  subsequent  pagination
          request  using  the Marker request parameter to retrieve more items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even  when  there  are more results available. We recommend that you
          check IsTruncated after every call to ensure that  you  receive  all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When  IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains the
          value to use for the Marker parameter in a subsequent pagination re-
          quest.

       Error -> (structure)
          An  object  that  contains  details  about  the reason the operation
          failed.

          Message -> (string)
              Detailed information about the reason that the operation failed.

          Code -> (string)
              The error code associated with the operation failure.
