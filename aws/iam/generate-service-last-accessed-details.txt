GENERATE-SERVICE-LAST-ACCESSED-DETAILSGENERATE-SERVICE-LAST-ACCESSED-DETAILS()



NAME
       generate-service-last-accessed-details -

DESCRIPTION
       Generates  a  report  that  includes details about when an IAM resource
       (user, group, role, or policy) was last used in an  attempt  to  access
       Amazon  Web  Services  services. Recent activity usually appears within
       four hours. IAM reports activity for at least the  last  400  days,  or
       less if your Region began supporting this feature within the last year.
       For more information, see Regions where data is tracked .

       WARNING:
          The service last accessed data includes all attempts  to  access  an
          Amazon Web Services API, not just the successful ones. This includes
          all attempts that were made using the Amazon Web Services Management
          Console, the Amazon Web Services API through any of the SDKs, or any
          of the command line tools. An unexpected entry in the  service  last
          accessed  data does not mean that your account has been compromised,
          because the request might have been denied. Refer to your CloudTrail
          logs as the authoritative source for information about all API calls
          and whether they were successful or denied access. For more informa-
          tion, see Logging IAM events with CloudTrail in the IAM User Guide .

       The  GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails operation returns a JobId . Use
       this parameter in the following operations to  retrieve  the  following
       details from your report:

       o GetServiceLastAccessedDetails   Use this operation for users, groups,
         roles, or policies to list every Amazon Web Services service that the
         resource  could  access using permissions policies. For each service,
         the response includes information about the most  recent  access  at-
         tempt.  The  JobId returned by GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetail must
         be used by the same role within a session, or by the same  user  when
         used to call GetServiceLastAccessedDetail .

       o GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities   Use  this  operation  for
         groups and policies to list information about the associated entities
         (users  or roles) that attempted to access a specific Amazon Web Ser-
         vices service.

       To check the status of the GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails  request,
       use  the  JobId parameter in the same operations and test the JobStatus
       response parameter.

       For additional information about the permissions policies that allow an
       identity  (user,  group,  or role) to access specific services, use the
       ListPoliciesGrantingServiceAccess operation.

       NOTE:
          Service last accessed data does not use other policy types when  de-
          termining  whether  a  resource  could access a service. These other
          policy types include resource-based policies, access control  lists,
          Organizations  policies,  IAM permissions boundaries, and STS assume
          role policies. It only applies permissions policy  logic.  For  more
          about the evaluation of policy types, see Evaluating policies in the
          IAM User Guide .

       For more information about service and action last accessed  data,  see
       Reducing  permissions  using service last accessed data in the IAM User
       Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            generate-service-last-accessed-details
          --arn <value>
          [--granularity <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The ARN of the IAM resource (user, group, role, or  managed  policy)
          used  to  generate information about when the resource was last used
          in an attempt to access an Amazon Web Services service.

       --granularity (string)
          The level of detail that you  want  to  generate.  You  can  specify
          whether  you  want to generate information about the last attempt to
          access services or actions. If you specify  service-level  granular-
          ity,  this operation generates only service data. If you specify ac-
          tion-level granularity, it generates service and action data. If you
          don't  include this optional parameter, the operation generates ser-
          vice data.

          Possible values:

          o SERVICE_LEVEL

          o ACTION_LEVEL

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To generate a service access report

       The  following  generate-service-last-accessed-details example starts a
       background job to generate a report that lists the services accessed by
       IAM  users  and other entities with a custom policy named intern-bound-
       ary. You can display the report after it  is  created  by  running  the
       get-service-last-accessed-details command.

          aws iam generate-service-last-accessed-details \
              --arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/intern-boundary

       Output:

          {
              "JobId": "2eb6c2b8-7b4c-3xmp-3c13-03b72c8cdfdc"
          }

       The  following  generate-service-last-accessed-details example starts a
       background job to generate a report that lists the services accessed by
       IAM  users  and other entities with the AWS managed AdministratorAccess
       policy. You can display the report after it is created by  running  the
       get-service-last-accessed-details command.:

          aws iam generate-service-last-accessed-details \
              --arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess

       Output:

          {
              "JobId": "78b6c2ba-d09e-6xmp-7039-ecde30b26916"
          }

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
          The  JobId that you can use in the  GetServiceLastAccessedDetails or
          GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities operations. The JobId  re-
          turned by GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetail must be used by the same
          role within a session, or by the same user when used to call GetSer-
          viceLastAccessedDetail .
