DISCONNECT-RECOVERY-INSTANCE()                  DISCONNECT-RECOVERY-INSTANCE()



NAME
       disconnect-recovery-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Disconnect  a  Recovery  Instance  from Elastic Disaster Recovery. Data
       replication is stopped immediately. All AWS resources created by  Elas-
       tic  Disaster Recovery for enabling the replication of the Recovery In-
       stance will be terminated / deleted within 90 minutes. If the agent  on
       the  Recovery  Instance  has not been prevented from communicating with
       the Elastic Disaster Recovery service, then it will receive  a  command
       to  uninstall  itself  (within approximately 10 minutes). The following
       properties of  the  Recovery  Instance  will  be  changed  immediately:
       dataReplicationInfo.dataReplicationState  will  be set to DISCONNECTED;
       The totalStorageBytes property for each  of  dataReplicationInfo.repli-
       catedDisks  will  be  set  to zero; dataReplicationInfo.lagDuration and
       dataReplicationInfo.lagDuration will be nullified.

SYNOPSIS
            disconnect-recovery-instance
          --recovery-instance-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --recovery-instance-id (string)
          The ID of the Recovery Instance to disconnect.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
