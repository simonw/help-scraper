SYNOPSIS
            start-recovery
          [--is-drill | --no-is-drill]
          --source-servers <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --is-drill | --no-is-drill (boolean)
          Whether this Source Server Recovery operation is a drill or not.

       --source-servers (list)
          The Source Servers that we want to start a Recovery Job for.

          (structure)
              An object representing the Source Server to recover.

              recoverySnapshotID -> (string)
                 The  ID  of a Recovery Snapshot we want to recover from. Omit
                 this field to launch from the latest data by taking an on-de-
                 mand snapshot.

              sourceServerID -> (string)
                 The ID of the Source Server you want to recover.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          recoverySnapshotID=string,sourceServerID=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "recoverySnapshotID": "string",
              "sourceServerID": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --tags (map)
          The tags to be associated with the Recovery Job.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
