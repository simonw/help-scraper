NAME
       describe-recovery-snapshots -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all Recovery Snapshots for a single Source Server.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-recovery-snapshots  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: items

SYNOPSIS
            describe-recovery-snapshots
          [--filters <value>]
          [--order <value>]
          --source-server-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (structure)
          A set of filters by which to return Recovery Snapshots.

          fromDateTime -> (string)
              The start date in a date range query.

          toDateTime -> (string)
              The end date in a date range query.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          fromDateTime=string,toDateTime=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "fromDateTime": "string",
            "toDateTime": "string"
          }

       --order (string)
          The sorted ordering by which to return Recovery Snapshots.

          Possible values:

          o ASC

          o DESC

       --source-server-id (string)
          Filter Recovery Snapshots by Source Server ID.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       items -> (list)
          An array of Recovery Snapshots.

          (structure)
              A snapshot of a Source Server used during recovery.

              ebsSnapshots -> (list)
                 A list of EBS snapshots.

                 (string)

              expectedTimestamp -> (string)
                 The timestamp of when we expect the snapshot to be taken.

              snapshotID -> (string)
                 The ID of the Recovery Snapshot.

              sourceServerID -> (string)
                 The ID of the Source Server that the snapshot was taken for.

              timestamp -> (string)
                 The actual timestamp that the snapshot was taken.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token of the next Recovery Snapshot to retrieve.
