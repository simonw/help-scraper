HEAD-OBJECT()                                                    HEAD-OBJECT()



NAME
       head-object -

DESCRIPTION
       The HEAD action retrieves metadata from an object without returning the
       object itself. This action is useful if you're only  interested  in  an
       object's  metadata.  To use HEAD , you must have READ access to the ob-
       ject.

       A HEAD request has the same options as a GET action on an  object.  The
       response  is  identical to the GET response except that there is no re-
       sponse body. Because of this, if the HEAD request generates  an  error,
       it  returns  a generic 400 Bad Request , 403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found
       code. It is not possible to retrieve the exact exception  beyond  these
       error codes.

       If  you  encrypt  an  object  by using server-side encryption with cus-
       tomer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you  store  the  object  in
       Amazon  S3,  then  when  you retrieve the metadata from the object, you
       must use the following headers:

       o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm

       o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key

       o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5

       For more information about SSE-C,  see  Server-Side  Encryption  (Using
       Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) .

       NOTE:

          o Encryption  request  headers,  like x-amz-server-side-encryption ,
            should  not  be  sent  for  GET  requests  if  your  object   uses
            server-side  encryption  with  Key  Management  Service (KMS) keys
            (SSE-KMS), dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web  Ser-
            vices  KMS  keys (DSSE-KMS), or server-side encryption with Amazon
            S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use these
            types of keys, youll get an HTTP 400 Bad Request error.

          o The  last  modified  property in this case is the creation date of
            the object.

       Request headers are limited to 8 KB in size. For more information,  see
       Common Request Headers .

       Consider the following when using request headers:

       o Consideration  1   If  both  of  the If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since
         headers are present in the request as follows:

         o If-Match condition evaluates to true , and;

         o If-Unmodified-Since condition evaluates to false ;

       Then Amazon S3 returns 200 OK and the data requested.

       o Consideration 2  If both of the If-None-Match  and  If-Modified-Since
         headers are present in the request as follows:

         o If-None-Match condition evaluates to false , and;

         o If-Modified-Since condition evaluates to true ;

       Then Amazon S3 returns the 304 Not Modified response code.

       For more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232 .
          Permissions

       You  need the relevant read object (or version) permission for this op-
       eration. For more information, see Actions,  resources,  and  condition
       keys for Amazon S3 . If the object you request doesn't exist, the error
       that Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also  have  the  s3:List-
       Bucket permission.

       o If you have the s3:ListBucket permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 re-
         turns an HTTP status code 404 error.

       o If you dont have the s3:ListBucket permission, Amazon S3  returns  an
         HTTP status code 403 error.

       The following actions are related to HeadObject :

       o GetObject

       o GetObjectAttributes

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket containing the object.

          When  using  this  action  with an access point, you must direct re-
          quests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes
          the  form  AccessPointName -AccountId .s3-accesspoint.*Region* .ama-
          zonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through  the
          Amazon  Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place
          of the bucket name. For more information about  access  point  ARNs,
          see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes  the  form `` AccessPointName -AccountId .*outpostID* .s3-out-
          posts.*Region* .amazonaws.com`` . When you use this action  with  S3
          on  Outposts  through  the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the
          Outposts access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more  in-
          formation  about  S3 on Outposts ARNs, see What is S3 on Outposts in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --if-match (string)
          Return the object only if its entity tag (ETag) is the same  as  the
          one specified; otherwise, return a 412 (precondition failed) error.

       --if-modified-since (timestamp)
          Return  the  object only if it has been modified since the specified
          time; otherwise, return a 304 (not modified) error.

       --if-none-match (string)
          Return the object only if its entity tag (ETag)  is  different  from
          the one specified; otherwise, return a 304 (not modified) error.

       --if-unmodified-since (timestamp)
          Return  the object only if it has not been modified since the speci-
          fied time; otherwise, return a 412 (precondition failed) error.

       --key (string)
          The object key.

       --range (string)
          HeadObject returns only the metadata for an object. If the Range  is
          satisfiable,  only the ContentLength is affected in the response. If
          the Range is not satisfiable, S3 returns a 416 - Requested Range Not
          Satisfiable error.

       --version-id (string)
          VersionId used to reference a specific version of the object.

       --sse-customer-algorithm (string)
          Specifies  the  algorithm  to use to when encrypting the object (for
          example, AES256).

       --sse-customer-key (string)
          Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to  use
          in  encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then
          it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the  encryption  key.  The
          key  must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
          x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm header.

       --sse-customer-key-md5 (string)
          Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according  to
          RFC  1321.  Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check
          to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for  the
          request.  Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their re-
          quests. For information about  downloading  objects  from  Requester
          Pays  buckets,  see Downloading Objects in Requester Pays Buckets in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --part-number (integer)
          Part number of the object being read. This is a positive integer be-
          tween 1 and 10,000. Effectively performs a 'ranged' HEAD request for
          the part specified. Useful querying about the size of the  part  and
          the number of parts in this object.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status  code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --checksum-mode (string)
          To retrieve the checksum, this parameter must be enabled.

          In  addition, if you enable ChecksumMode and the object is encrypted
          with Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services
          KMS), you must have permission to use the kms:Decrypt action for the
          request to succeed.

          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command retrieves metadata for  an  object  in  a  bucket
       named my-bucket:

          aws s3api head-object --bucket my-bucket --key index.html

       Output:

          {
              "AcceptRanges": "bytes",
              "ContentType": "text/html",
              "LastModified": "Thu, 16 Apr 2015 18:19:14 GMT",
              "ContentLength": 77,
              "VersionId": "null",
              "ETag": "\"30a6ec7e1a9ad79c203d05a589c8b400\"",
              "Metadata": {}
          }

OUTPUT
       DeleteMarker -> (boolean)
          Specifies whether the object retrieved was (true) or was not (false)
          a Delete Marker. If false, this response header does not  appear  in
          the response.

       AcceptRanges -> (string)
          Indicates that a range of bytes was specified.

       Expiration -> (string)
          If  the  object expiration is configured (see PUT Bucket lifecycle),
          the response includes this header. It includes the  expiry-date  and
          rule-id key-value pairs providing object expiration information. The
          value of the rule-id is URL-encoded.

       Restore -> (string)
          If the object is an archived object (an object whose  storage  class
          is GLACIER), the response includes this header if either the archive
          restoration is in progress (see RestoreObject or an archive copy  is
          already restored.

          If  an  archive copy is already restored, the header value indicates
          when Amazon S3 is scheduled to delete the object copy. For example:
              x-amz-restore: ongoing-request="false", expiry-date="Fri, 21 Dec
              2012 00:00:00 GMT"

          If  the  object  restoration  is in progress, the header returns the
          value ongoing-request="true" .

          For more information about archiving objects, see Transitioning  Ob-
          jects: General Considerations .

       ArchiveStatus -> (string)
          The archive state of the head object.

       LastModified -> (timestamp)
          Creation date of the object.

       ContentLength -> (long)
          Size of the body in bytes.

       ChecksumCRC32 -> (string)
          The  base64-encoded,  32-bit CRC32 checksum of the object. This will
          only be present if it was uploaded with the object.  With  multipart
          uploads,  this  may  not be a checksum value of the object. For more
          information about how checksums are calculated  with  multipart  up-
          loads, see Checking object integrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       ChecksumCRC32C -> (string)
          The  base64-encoded, 32-bit CRC32C checksum of the object. This will
          only be present if it was uploaded with the object.  With  multipart
          uploads,  this  may  not be a checksum value of the object. For more
          information about how checksums are calculated  with  multipart  up-
          loads, see Checking object integrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       ChecksumSHA1 -> (string)
          The  base64-encoded,  160-bit  SHA-1 digest of the object. This will
          only be present if it was uploaded with the object.  With  multipart
          uploads,  this  may  not be a checksum value of the object. For more
          information about how checksums are calculated  with  multipart  up-
          loads, see Checking object integrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       ChecksumSHA256 -> (string)
          The  base64-encoded, 256-bit SHA-256 digest of the object. This will
          only be present if it was uploaded with the object.  With  multipart
          uploads,  this  may  not be a checksum value of the object. For more
          information about how checksums are calculated  with  multipart  up-
          loads, see Checking object integrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       ETag -> (string)
          An  entity  tag  (ETag)  is  an  opaque identifier assigned by a web
          server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL.

       MissingMeta -> (integer)
          This is set to the  number  of  metadata  entries  not  returned  in
          x-amz-meta  headers. This can happen if you create metadata using an
          API like SOAP that supports more flexible  metadata  than  the  REST
          API.  For  example, using SOAP, you can create metadata whose values
          are not legal HTTP headers.

       VersionId -> (string)
          Version of the object.

       CacheControl -> (string)
          Specifies caching behavior along the request/reply chain.

       ContentDisposition -> (string)
          Specifies presentational information for the object.

       ContentEncoding -> (string)
          Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and
          thus  what  decoding  mechanisms  must  be applied to obtain the me-
          dia-type referenced by the Content-Type header field.

       ContentLanguage -> (string)
          The language the content is in.

       ContentType -> (string)
          A standard MIME type describing the format of the object data.

       Expires -> (timestamp)
          The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.

       WebsiteRedirectLocation -> (string)
          If the bucket is configured as a  website,  redirects  requests  for
          this  object  to another object in the same bucket or to an external
          URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the  object  meta-
          data.

       ServerSideEncryption -> (string)
          The  server-side  encryption algorithm used when storing this object
          in Amazon S3 (for example, AES256 , aws:kms , aws:kms:dsse ).

       Metadata -> (map)
          A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       SSECustomerAlgorithm -> (string)
          If server-side encryption with a  customer-provided  encryption  key
          was  requested, the response will include this header confirming the
          encryption algorithm used.

       SSECustomerKeyMD5 -> (string)
          If server-side encryption with a  customer-provided  encryption  key
          was  requested,  the  response  will  include this header to provide
          round-trip message integrity verification of  the  customer-provided
          encryption key.

       SSEKMSKeyId -> (string)
          If  present,  specifies  the  ID of the Key Management Service (KMS)
          symmetric encryption customer managed key that was used for the  ob-
          ject.

       BucketKeyEnabled -> (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  the object uses an S3 Bucket Key for server-side
          encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS).

       StorageClass -> (string)
          Provides storage class information of the object. Amazon S3  returns
          this header for all objects except for S3 Standard storage class ob-
          jects.

          For more information, see Storage Classes .

       RequestCharged -> (string)
          If present, indicates that the requester  was  successfully  charged
          for the request.

       ReplicationStatus -> (string)
          Amazon  S3  can return this header if your request involves a bucket
          that is either a source or a destination in a replication rule.

          In replication, you have a source  bucket  on  which  you  configure
          replication and destination bucket or buckets where Amazon S3 stores
          object replicas. When you request an object (GetObject )  or  object
          metadata (HeadObject ) from these buckets, Amazon S3 will return the
          x-amz-replication-status header in the response as follows:

          o If requesting an object from the source bucket ,  Amazon  S3  will
            return  the  x-amz-replication-status header if the object in your
            request is eligible for replication. For example, suppose that  in
            your  replication configuration, you specify object prefix TaxDocs
            requesting Amazon S3 to replicate objects with key prefix  TaxDocs
            .  Any  objects  you upload with this key name prefix, for example
            TaxDocs/document1.pdf , are eligible for replication. For any  ob-
            ject  request with this key name prefix, Amazon S3 will return the
            x-amz-replication-status header with value PENDING,  COMPLETED  or
            FAILED indicating object replication status.

          o If requesting an object from a destination bucket , Amazon S3 will
            return the x-amz-replication-status header with value  REPLICA  if
            the object in your request is a replica that Amazon S3 created and
            there is no replica modification replication in progress.

          o When replicating objects to multiple  destination  buckets  ,  the
            x-amz-replication-status  header  acts  differently. The header of
            the source object will only  return  a  value  of  COMPLETED  when
            replication is successful to all destinations. The header will re-
            main at value PENDING until replication has completed for all des-
            tinations.  If  one  or  more  destinations  fails replication the
            header will return FAILED.

          For more information, see Replication .

       PartsCount -> (integer)
          The count of parts this object has. This value is only  returned  if
          you  specify  partNumber in your request and the object was uploaded
          as a multipart upload.

       ObjectLockMode -> (string)
          The Object Lock mode, if any, that's in effect for this object. This
          header  is only returned if the requester has the s3:GetObjectReten-
          tion permission. For more information  about  S3  Object  Lock,  see
          Object Lock .

       ObjectLockRetainUntilDate -> (timestamp)
          The  date  and  time  when the Object Lock retention period expires.
          This header is only returned if the requester has  the  s3:GetObjec-
          tRetention permission.

       ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus -> (string)
          Specifies  whether  a  legal hold is in effect for this object. This
          header is only returned if the requester has the  s3:GetObjectLegal-
          Hold  permission.  This header is not returned if the specified ver-
          sion of this object has never had a legal hold applied. For more in-
          formation about S3 Object Lock, see Object Lock .
