NAME
       get-bucket-lifecycle-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          Bucket  lifecycle  configuration now supports specifying a lifecycle
          rule using an object key name prefix, one or more object tags, or  a
          combination  of both. Accordingly, this section describes the latest
          API. The response describes the new filter element that you can  use
          to  specify a filter to select a subset of objects to which the rule
          applies. If you are using a previous version of the  lifecycle  con-
          figuration,   it   still   works.   For   the  earlier  action,  see
          GetBucketLifecycle .

       Returns the lifecycle configuration information set on the bucket.  For
       information about lifecycle configuration, see Object Lifecycle Manage-
       ment .

       To use  this  operation,  you  must  have  permission  to  perform  the
       s3:GetLifecycleConfiguration  action. The bucket owner has this permis-
       sion, by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others.
       For  more  information  about  permissions,  see Permissions Related to
       Bucket Subresource Operations and Managing Access Permissions  to  Your
       Amazon S3 Resources .
          GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration has the following special error:

       o Error code: NoSuchLifecycleConfiguration

         o Description: The lifecycle configuration does not exist.

         o HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found

         o SOAP Fault Code Prefix: Client

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-lifecycle-configuration
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket for which to get the lifecycle information.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  command  retrieves  the  lifecycle  configuration for a
       bucket named my-bucket:

          aws s3api get-bucket-lifecycle-configuration --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

OUTPUT
       Rules -> (list)
          Container for a lifecycle rule.

          (structure)
              A lifecycle rule for individual objects in an Amazon S3 bucket.

              Expiration -> (structure)
                 Specifies the expiration for the lifecycle of the  object  in
                 the  form  of date, days and, whether the object has a delete
                 marker.

                 Date -> (timestamp)
                     Indicates at what date the  object  is  to  be  moved  or
                     deleted. Should be in GMT ISO 8601 Format.

                 Days -> (integer)
                     Indicates  the lifetime, in days, of the objects that are
                     subject to the rule. The value must be a  non-zero  posi-
                     tive integer.

                 ExpiredObjectDeleteMarker -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  whether  Amazon S3 will remove a delete marker
                     with no noncurrent versions. If set to true,  the  delete
                     marker  will be expired; if set to false the policy takes
                     no action. This cannot be specified with Days or Date  in
                     a Lifecycle Expiration Policy.

              ID -> (string)
                 Unique  identifier  for  the rule. The value cannot be longer
                 than 255 characters.

              Prefix -> (string)
                 Prefix identifying one or more objects to which the rule  ap-
                 plies. This is no longer used; use Filter instead.

                 WARNING:
                     Replacement  must be made for object keys containing spe-
                     cial characters (such as carriage returns) when using XML
                     requests.  For  more  information, see XML related object
                     key constraints .

              Filter -> (structure)
                 The Filter is used to identify objects that a Lifecycle  Rule
                 applies  to. A Filter must have exactly one of Prefix , Tag ,
                 or And specified. Filter is  required  if  the  LifecycleRule
                 does not contain a Prefix element.

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     Prefix  identifying one or more objects to which the rule
                     applies.

                     WARNING:
                        Replacement must be made for  object  keys  containing
                        special characters (such as carriage returns) when us-
                        ing XML requests. For more information,  see  XML  re-
                        lated object key constraints .

                 Tag -> (structure)
                     This  tag must exist in the object's tag set in order for
                     the rule to apply.

                     Key -> (string)
                        Name of the object key.

                     Value -> (string)
                        Value of the tag.

                 ObjectSizeGreaterThan -> (long)
                     Minimum object size to which the rule applies.

                 ObjectSizeLessThan -> (long)
                     Maximum object size to which the rule applies.

                 And -> (structure)
                     This is used in a Lifecycle Rule Filter to apply a  logi-
                     cal  AND  to  two  or more predicates. The Lifecycle Rule
                     will apply to any object matching all of  the  predicates
                     configured inside the And operator.

                     Prefix -> (string)
                        Prefix  identifying  one  or more objects to which the
                        rule applies.

                     Tags -> (list)
                        All of these tags must exist in the object's  tag  set
                        in order for the rule to apply.

                        (structure)
                            A container of a key value name pair.

                               Name of the object key.

                            Value -> (string)
                               Value of the tag.

                     ObjectSizeGreaterThan -> (long)
                        Minimum object size to which the rule applies.

                     ObjectSizeLessThan -> (long)
                        Maximum object size to which the rule applies.

              Status -> (string)
                 If  'Enabled',  the rule is currently being applied. If 'Dis-
                 abled', the rule is not currently being applied.

              Transitions -> (list)
                 Specifies when an Amazon S3 object transitions to a specified
                 storage class.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies when an object transitions to a specified stor-
                     age class. For more information about Amazon S3 lifecycle
                     configuration rules, see Transitioning Objects Using Ama-
                     zon S3 Lifecycle in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                     Date -> (timestamp)
                        Indicates when objects are transitioned to the  speci-
                        fied storage class. The date value must be in ISO 8601
                        format. The time is always midnight UTC.

                     Days -> (integer)
                        Indicates the number of days after creation  when  ob-
                        jects are transitioned to the specified storage class.
                        The value must be a positive integer.

                     StorageClass -> (string)
                        The storage class to which  you  want  the  object  to
                        transition.

              NoncurrentVersionTransitions -> (list)
                 Specifies the transition rule for the lifecycle rule that de-
                 scribes when noncurrent  objects  transition  to  a  specific
                 storage  class. If your bucket is versioning-enabled (or ver-
                 sioning is suspended), you can set  this  action  to  request
                 that  Amazon  S3  transition  noncurrent object versions to a
                 specific storage class at a set period in the object's  life-
                 time.

                 (structure)
                     Container  for  the  transition  rule that describes when
                     noncurrent objects transition to the STANDARD_IA  ,  ONE-
                     ZONE_IA , INTELLIGENT_TIERING , GLACIER_IR , GLACIER , or
                     DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class. If your  bucket  is  version-
                     ing-enabled  (or  versioning  is  suspended), you can set
                     this action to request that Amazon S3 transition  noncur-
                     rent  object  versions  to the STANDARD_IA , ONEZONE_IA ,
                     INTELLIGENT_TIERING , GLACIER_IR , GLACIER , or  DEEP_AR-
                     CHIVE  storage class at a specific period in the object's
                     lifetime.

                     NoncurrentDays -> (integer)
                        Specifies the number of days an object  is  noncurrent
                        before  Amazon  S3  can perform the associated action.
                        For information about  the  noncurrent  days  calcula-
                        tions, see How Amazon S3 Calculates How Long an Object
                        Has Been Noncurrent in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                     StorageClass -> (string)
                        The class of storage used to store the object.

                     NewerNoncurrentVersions -> (integer)
                        Specifies how many noncurrent versions Amazon S3  will
                        retain.  If there are this many more recent noncurrent
                        versions, Amazon S3 will take the  associated  action.
                        For  more  information  about noncurrent versions, see
                        Lifecycle configuration elements in the Amazon S3 User
                        Guide .

              NoncurrentVersionExpiration -> (structure)
                 Specifies  when noncurrent object versions expire. Upon expi-
                 ration, Amazon S3 permanently deletes the  noncurrent  object
                 versions.  You  set  this lifecycle configuration action on a
                 bucket that has versioning enabled (or suspended) to  request
                 that  Amazon  S3  delete noncurrent object versions at a spe-
                 cific period in the object's lifetime.

                 NoncurrentDays -> (integer)
                     Specifies the number of days an object is noncurrent  be-
                     fore  Amazon  S3  can  perform the associated action. The
                     value must be a non-zero positive integer.  For  informa-
                     tion about the noncurrent days calculations, see How Ama-
                     zon S3 Calculates When an Object Became Noncurrent in the
                     Amazon S3 User Guide .

                 NewerNoncurrentVersions -> (integer)
                     Specifies how many noncurrent versions Amazon S3 will re-
                     tain. If there are this many more recent noncurrent  ver-
                     sions,  Amazon  S3  will  take the associated action. For
                     more information about noncurrent versions, see Lifecycle
                     configuration elements in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload -> (structure)
                 Specifies the days since the initiation of an incomplete mul-
                 tipart upload that Amazon S3 will wait before permanently re-
                 moving  all  parts  of  the upload. For more information, see
                 Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket  Lifecy-
                 cle Policy in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                 DaysAfterInitiation -> (integer)
                     Specifies the number of days after which Amazon S3 aborts
                     an incomplete multipart upload.
