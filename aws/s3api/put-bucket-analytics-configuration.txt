PUT-BUCKET-ANALYTICS-CONFIGURATION()      PUT-BUCKET-ANALYTICS-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       put-bucket-analytics-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets  an  analytics configuration for the bucket (specified by the ana-
       lytics configuration ID). You can have up to 1,000 analytics configura-
       tions per bucket.

       You  can  choose to have storage class analysis export analysis reports
       sent to a comma-separated values (CSV) flat file.  See  the  DataExport
       request  element. Reports are updated daily and are based on the object
       filters that you configure. When selecting data export, you  specify  a
       destination bucket and an optional destination prefix where the file is
       written. You can export the data to a destination bucket in a different
       account.  However, the destination bucket must be in the same Region as
       the bucket that you are making the PUT analytics configuration to.  For
       more information, see Amazon S3 Analytics  Storage Class Analysis .

       WARNING:
          You  must create a bucket policy on the destination bucket where the
          exported file is written to grant permissions to Amazon S3 to  write
          objects  to  the bucket. For an example policy, see Granting Permis-
          sions for Amazon S3 Inventory and Storage Class Analysis .

       To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3:Put-
       AnalyticsConfiguration  action. The bucket owner has this permission by
       default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more
       information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subre-
       source Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Re-
       sources .

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)

          stored.

              filter must have exactly one prefix, one tag, or one conjunction
              (AnalyticsAndOperator).  If  no  filter is provided, all objects
              will be considered in any analysis.

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     The prefix to use when evaluating an AND  predicate:  The
                     prefix  that  an  object  must have to be included in the
                     metrics results.

                 Tags -> (list)

                 Specifies how data related to the storage class analysis  for
                 an Amazon S3 bucket should be exported.

                 OutputSchemaVersion -> (string)
                     The  version  of  the output schema to use when exporting
                     data. Must be V_1 .

                            NOTE:
                               Although  this  value  is optional, we strongly
                               recommend that you set it to help prevent prob-
                               lems   if   the  destination  bucket  ownership
                               changes.

                }
              }
            }
          }

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP 403 (Ac-
          cess Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To sets an analytics configuration for the bucket

       The following put-bucket-analytics-configuration example configures an-
       alytics for the specified bucket.

          aws s3api put-bucket-analytics-configuration \
              --bucket my-bucket --id 1 \
              --analytics-configuration '{"Id": "1","StorageClassAnalysis": {}}'

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
