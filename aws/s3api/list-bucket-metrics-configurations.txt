NAME
       list-bucket-metrics-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the metrics configurations for the bucket. The metrics configura-
       tions are only for the request metrics of the bucket and do not provide
       information on daily storage metrics. You can have up to 1,000 configu-
       rations per bucket.

       This action supports list pagination and does not return more than  100
       configurations  at  a time. Always check the IsTruncated element in the
       response. If there are no more configurations to list,  IsTruncated  is
       set  to false. If there are more configurations to list, IsTruncated is
       set to true, and there is a value in NextContinuationToken  .  You  use
       the  NextContinuationToken value to continue the pagination of the list
       by passing the value in continuation-token in the request  to  GET  the
       next page.

       To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3:Get-
       MetricsConfiguration action. The bucket owner has  this  permission  by
       default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more
       information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subre-
       source Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Re-
       sources .

       For more information about metrics configurations  and  CloudWatch  re-
       quest metrics, see Monitoring Metrics with Amazon CloudWatch .

SYNOPSIS
            list-bucket-metrics-configurations
          --bucket <value>
          [--continuation-token <value>]
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket containing the metrics configurations to  re-
          trieve.

       --continuation-token (string)
          The  marker that is used to continue a metrics configuration listing
          that has been truncated. Use the NextContinuationToken from a previ-
          ously truncated list response to continue the listing. The continua-
          tion token is an opaque value that Amazon S3 understands.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP 403 (Ac-
          cess Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve a list of metrics configurations for a bucket

       The following list-bucket-metrics-configurations  example  retrieves  a
       list of metrics configurations for the specified bucket.

          aws s3api list-bucket-metrics-configurations \
              --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "IsTruncated": false,
              "MetricsConfigurationList": [
                  {
                      "Filter": {
                          "Prefix": "logs"
                      },
                      "Id": "123"
                  },
                  {
                      "Filter": {
                          "Prefix": "tmp"
                      },
                      "Id": "234"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  the  returned  list of metrics configurations is
          complete. A value of true indicates that the list  is  not  complete
          and  the NextContinuationToken will be provided for a subsequent re-
          quest.

       ContinuationToken -> (string)
          The marker that is used as a starting point for this metrics config-
          uration  list  response. This value is present if it was sent in the
          request.

       NextContinuationToken -> (string)
          The marker used to continue a metrics configuration listing that has
          been  truncated.  Use  the  NextContinuationToken  from a previously
          truncated list response to continue the  listing.  The  continuation
          token is an opaque value that Amazon S3 understands.

       MetricsConfigurationList -> (list)
          The list of metrics configurations for a bucket.

          (structure)
              Specifies  a  metrics  configuration  for the CloudWatch request
              metrics (specified by the metrics configuration ID) from an Ama-
              zon S3 bucket. If you're updating an existing metrics configura-
              tion, note that this is a full replacement of the existing  met-
              rics  configuration.  If you don't include the elements you want
              to  keep,  they  are   erased.   For   more   information,   see
              PutBucketMetricsConfiguration .

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID used to identify the metrics configuration.

              Filter -> (structure)
                 Specifies a metrics configuration filter. The metrics config-
                 uration will only include objects that meet the filter's cri-
                 teria.  A  filter  must be a prefix, an object tag, an access
                 point ARN, or a conjunction (MetricsAndOperator).

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     The prefix used when evaluating a metrics filter.

                 Tag -> (structure)
                     The tag used when evaluating a metrics filter.

                     Key -> (string)
                        Name of the object key.

                     Value -> (string)
                        Value of the tag.

                 AccessPointArn -> (string)
                     The access point ARN used when evaluating a metrics  fil-
                     ter.

                 And -> (structure)
                     A  conjunction (logical AND) of predicates, which is used
                     in evaluating a metrics filter. The operator must have at
                     least two predicates, and an object must match all of the
                     predicates in order for the filter to apply.

                     Prefix -> (string)
                        The prefix used when evaluating an AND predicate.

                     Tags -> (list)
                        The list of tags used when evaluating  an  AND  predi-
                        cate.

                        (structure)
                            A container of a key value name pair.

                            Key -> (string)
                               Name of the object key.

                            Value -> (string)
                               Value of the tag.

                     AccessPointArn -> (string)
                        The access point ARN used when evaluating an AND pred-
                        icate.
