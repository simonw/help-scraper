SYNOPSIS
            put-bucket-ownership-controls
          --bucket <value>
          [--content-md5 <value>]
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          --ownership-controls <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the Amazon S3 bucket whose OwnershipControls you want to
          set.

       --content-md5 (string)
          The MD5 hash of the OwnershipControls request body.

          For requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line  Inter-
          face (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated au-
          tomatically.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP 403 (Ac-
          cess Denied) error.

       --ownership-controls (structure)
          The OwnershipControls (BucketOwnerEnforced, BucketOwnerPreferred, or
          ObjectWriter) that you want to apply to this Amazon S3 bucket.

          Rules -> (list)
              The container element for an ownership control rule.

              (structure)
                 The container element for an ownership control rule.

                 ObjectOwnership -> (string)
                     The container element for object ownership for a bucket's
                     ownership controls.

                     BucketOwnerPreferred - Objects  uploaded  to  the  bucket
                     change  ownership  to the bucket owner if the objects are
                     uploaded with the bucket-owner-full-control canned ACL.

                     ObjectWriter - The uploading account will own the  object
                     if the object is uploaded with the bucket-owner-full-con-
                     trol canned ACL.

                     BucketOwnerEnforced - Access  control  lists  (ACLs)  are
                     disabled  and  no  longer  affect permissions. The bucket
                     owner automatically owns and has full control over  every
                     object  in  the  bucket.  The bucket only accepts PUT re-
                     quests that don't specify an ACL  or  bucket  owner  full
                     control   ACLs,  such  as  the  bucket-owner-full-control
                     canned ACL or an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in
                     the XML format.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Rules=[{ObjectOwnership=string},{ObjectOwnership=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Rules": [
              {
                "ObjectOwnership": "BucketOwnerPreferred"|"ObjectWriter"|"BucketOwnerEnforced"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
