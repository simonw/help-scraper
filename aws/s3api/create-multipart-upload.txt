CREATE-MULTIPART-UPLOAD()                            CREATE-MULTIPART-UPLOAD()



NAME
       create-multipart-upload -

DESCRIPTION
       This action initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID. This
       upload ID is used to associate all of the parts in the specific  multi-
       part  upload. You specify this upload ID in each of your subsequent up-
       load part requests (see UploadPart ). You also include this  upload  ID
       in  the  final request to either complete or abort the multipart upload
       request.

       For more information about  multipart  uploads,  see  Multipart  Upload
       Overview .

       If  you  have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart
       uploads, the upload must complete within the number of  days  specified
       in the bucket lifecycle configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multi-
       part upload becomes eligible for an abort action and Amazon  S3  aborts
       the  multipart  upload.  For  more information, see Aborting Incomplete
       Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Policy .

       For information about the permissions required to use the multipart up-
       load API, see Multipart Upload and Permissions .

       For  request  signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular re-
       quests. You initiate a multipart upload, send one or more  requests  to
       upload  parts, and then complete the multipart upload process. You sign
       each request individually. There is nothing special about signing  mul-
       tipart  upload  requests.  For  more  information  about  signing,  see
       Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) .

       NOTE:
          After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more  parts,
          to  stop  being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must ei-
          ther complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up  the
          space used to store the parts and stop charging you for storing them
          only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload.

       You can optionally request server-side encryption. For server-side  en-
       cryption,  Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its
       data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You can  provide  your
       own  encryption  key,  or  use  Amazon  Web Services KMS keys or Amazon
       S3-managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide your  own  encryp-
       tion   key,   the   request  headers  you  provide  in  UploadPart  and
       UploadPartCopy requests must match the headers you used in the  request
       to initiate the upload by using CreateMultipartUpload .

       To  perform a multipart upload with encryption using an Amazon Web Ser-
       vices KMS key, the requester must have permission  to  the  kms:Decrypt
       and  kms:GenerateDataKey* actions on the key. These permissions are re-
       quired because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the  encrypted
       file  parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more informa-
       tion, see Multipart upload API and permissions in the  Amazon  S3  User
       Guide .

       If  your  Identity  and  Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the
       same Amazon Web Services account as the KMS key,  then  you  must  have
       these  permissions  on the key policy. If your IAM user or role belongs
       to a different account than the key, then you must have the permissions
       on both the key policy and your IAM user or role.

       For  more information, see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption
       .
          Access Permissions

       When copying an object, you can  optionally  specify  the  accounts  or
       groups  that  should be granted specific permissions on the new object.
       There are two ways to grant the permissions using the request headers:

       o Specify a canned ACL with the x-amz-acl request header. For more  in-
         formation, see Canned ACL .

       o Specify  access  permissions  explicitly  with the x-amz-grant-read ,
         x-amz-grant-read-acp     ,      x-amz-grant-write-acp      ,      and
         x-amz-grant-full-control  headers. These parameters map to the set of
         permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more  information,
         see Access Control List (ACL) Overview .

       You  can  use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explic-
       itly. You cannot do both.
          Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers

       You can optionally tell  Amazon  S3  to  encrypt  data  at  rest  using
       server-side  encryption.  Server-side encryption is for data encryption
       at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks  in  its
       data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The option you use de-
       pends on whether you want to use Amazon Web Services managed encryption
       keys or provide your own encryption key.

       o Use  encryption  keys  managed  by  Amazon S3 or customer managed key
         stored in Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Ser-
         vices  KMS)   If you want Amazon Web Services to manage the keys used
         to encrypt data, specify the following headers in the request.

         o x-amz-server-side-encryption

         o x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id

         o x-amz-server-side-encryption-context

       NOTE:
          If you specify x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms , but don't pro-
          vide  x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id  ,  Amazon S3 uses
          the Amazon Web Services managed key in Amazon Web  Services  KMS  to
          protect the data.

       WARNING:
          All  GET and PUT requests for an object protected by Amazon Web Ser-
          vices KMS fail if you don't make them with SSL or by using SigV4.

       For  more  information  about  server-side  encryption  with  KMS   key
       (SSE-KMS),  see  Protecting  Data Using Server-Side Encryption with KMS
       keys .

       o Use customer-provided encryption keys  If you want to manage your own
         encryption keys, provide all the following headers in the request.

         o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm

         o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key

         o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5

       (SSE-KMS), see Protecting Data Using Server-Side  Encryption  with  KMS
       keys .
          Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers

       You  also can use the following access controlrelated headers with this
       operation. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full
       access  control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to
       individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined
       by  Amazon  S3.  These permissions are then added to the access control
       list (ACL) on the object. For more information, see Using ACLs  .  With
       this  operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the fol-
       lowing two methods:

       o Specify a canned ACL (x-amz-acl )  Amazon S3 supports a set of prede-
         fined  ACLs,  known as canned ACLs . Each canned ACL has a predefined
         set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see Canned ACL
         .

       o Specify  access  permissions  explicitly   To explicitly grant access
         permissions to specific Amazon Web Services accounts or  groups,  use
         the  following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions that
         Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see  Access  Con-
         trol  List  (ACL)  Overview  .  In  the header, you specify a list of
         grantees who get the specific permission. To  grant  permissions  ex-
         plicitly, use:

         o x-amz-grant-read

         o x-amz-grant-write

         o x-amz-grant-read-acp

         o x-amz-grant-write-acp

         o x-amz-grant-full-control

       You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of
       the following:

          o id  if the value specified is the canonical user ID of  an  Amazon
            Web Services account

          o uri  if you are granting permissions to a predefined group

          o emailAddress   if  the  value specified is the email address of an
            Amazon Web Services account

          NOTE:
                 Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only  supported
                 in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:

                     o US East (N. Virginia)

                     o US West (N. California)

                     o US West (Oregon)

                     o Asia Pacific (Singapore)

                     o Asia Pacific (Sydney)

                     o Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

                     o Europe (Ireland)

                     o South America (So Paulo)

              For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints,
              see Regions and Endpoints in the  Amazon  Web  Services  General
              Reference.

       For  example,  the  following x-amz-grant-read header grants the Amazon
       Web Services accounts identified by account IDs permissions to read ob-
       ject data and its metadata:
          x-amz-grant-read: id="11112222333", id="444455556666"

OPTIONS
       --acl (string)
          The canned ACL to apply to the object.

          This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          Possible values:

          o private

          o public-read

          o public-read-write

          o authenticated-read

          o aws-exec-read

          o bucket-owner-read

          o bucket-owner-full-control

       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket to which to initiate the upload

          When  using  this  action  with an access point, you must direct re-
          quests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes
          the  form  AccessPointName -AccountId .s3-accesspoint.*Region* .ama-
          zonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through  the
          Amazon  Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place
          of the bucket name. For more information about  access  point  ARNs,
          see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When  using  this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes  the  form  AccessPointName  -AccountId  .*outpostID* .s3-out-
          posts.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action  using  S3  on
          Outposts  through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Out-
          posts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For  more  information
          about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3
          User Guide .

       --content-disposition (string)
          Specifies presentational information for the object.

       --content-encoding (string)
          Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and
          thus  what  decoding  mechanisms  must  be applied to obtain the me-
          dia-type referenced by the Content-Type header field.

       --content-language (string)
          The language the content is in.

       --content-type (string)
          A standard MIME type describing the format of the object data.

       --expires (timestamp)
          The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.

       --grant-full-control (string)
          Gives the grantee READ, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP permissions  on  the
          object.

          This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       --grant-read (string)
          Allows grantee to read the object data and its metadata.

          This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       --grant-read-acp (string)
          Allows grantee to read the object ACL.

          This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       --grant-write-acp (string)
          Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable object.

          This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       --key (string)
          Object key for which the multipart upload is to be initiated.

       --metadata (map)
          A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --server-side-encryption (string)
          The  server-side  encryption algorithm used when storing this object
          in Amazon S3 (for example, AES256, aws:kms).

          Possible values:

          o AES256

          o aws:kms

       --storage-class (string)
          By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly
          created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability
          and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can spec-
          ify  a  different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the
          OUTPOSTS Storage Class. For more information, see Storage Classes in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o STANDARD

          o REDUCED_REDUNDANCY

          o STANDARD_IA

          o ONEZONE_IA

          o INTELLIGENT_TIERING

          o GLACIER

          o DEEP_ARCHIVE

          o OUTPOSTS

          o GLACIER_IR

       --website-redirect-location (string)
          If  the  bucket  is  configured as a website, redirects requests for
          this object to another object in the same bucket or to  an  external
          URL.  Amazon  S3 stores the value of this header in the object meta-
          data.

       --sse-customer-algorithm (string)
          Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting  the  object  (for
          example, AES256).

       --sse-customer-key (string)
          Specifies  the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use
          in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and  then
          it  is  discarded;  Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The
          key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in  the
          x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm header.

       --sse-customer-key-md5 (string)
          Specifies  the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to
          RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message  integrity  check
          to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

       --ssekms-key-id (string)
          Specifies  the  ID  of the symmetric customer managed key to use for
          object encryption. All GET and PUT requests for an object  protected
          by  Amazon  Web  Services KMS will fail if not made via SSL or using
          SigV4. For information about configuring using any of the officially
          supported  Amazon Web Services SDKs and Amazon Web Services CLI, see
          Specifying the Signature Version in Request  Authentication  in  the
          Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --ssekms-encryption-context (string)
          Specifies  the Amazon Web Services KMS Encryption Context to use for
          object encryption. The value of  this  header  is  a  base64-encoded
          UTF-8  string  holding  JSON  with  the encryption context key-value
          pairs.

       --bucket-key-enabled | --no-bucket-key-enabled (boolean)
          Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key  for  object
          encryption with server-side encryption using AWS KMS (SSE-KMS). Set-
          ting this header to true causes Amazon S3 to use an  S3  Bucket  Key
          for object encryption with SSE-KMS.

          Specifying   this   header  with  an  object  action  doesnt  affect
          bucket-level settings for S3 Bucket Key.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for  the
          request.  Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their re-
          quests. For information about  downloading  objects  from  requester
          pays  buckets,  see Downloading Objects in Requestor Pays Buckets in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --tagging (string)
          The tag-set for the object. The tag-set must be encoded as URL Query
          parameters.

       --object-lock-mode (string)
          Specifies  the  Object  Lock  mode that you want to apply to the up-
          loaded object.

          Possible values:

          o GOVERNANCE

          o COMPLIANCE

       --object-lock-retain-until-date (timestamp)
          Specifies the date and time when you want the Object Lock to expire.

       --object-lock-legal-hold-status (string)
          Specifies whether you want to apply a Legal Hold to the uploaded ob-
          ject.

          Possible values:

          o ON

          o OFF

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP 403  (Ac-
          cess Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  command  creates  a  multipart  upload  in  the  bucket
       my-bucket with the key multipart/01:

          aws s3api create-multipart-upload --bucket my-bucket --key 'multipart/01'

       Output:

          {
              "Bucket": "my-bucket",
              "UploadId": "dfRtDYU0WWCCcH43C3WFbkRONycyCpTJJvxu2i5GYkZljF.Yxwh6XG7WfS2vC4to6HiV6Yjlx.cph0gtNBtJ8P3URCSbB7rjxI5iEwVDmgaXZOGgkk5nVTW16HOQ5l0R",
              "Key": "multipart/01"
          }

       The completed file will be named 01 in a folder called multipart in the
       bucket my-bucket. Save the upload ID, key and bucket name for use  with
       the upload-part command.

OUTPUT
       AbortDate -> (timestamp)
          If  the  bucket  has  a  lifecycle rule configured with an action to
          abort incomplete multipart uploads and the prefix in  the  lifecycle
          rule  matches  the object name in the request, the response includes
          this header. The header indicates when the initiated  multipart  up-
          load  becomes eligible for an abort operation. For more information,
          see Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a  Bucket  Lifecycle
          Policy .

          The  response also includes the x-amz-abort-rule-id header that pro-
          vides the ID of the lifecycle configuration rule that  defines  this
          action.

       AbortRuleId -> (string)
          This  header  is returned along with the x-amz-abort-date header. It
          identifies the applicable lifecycle configuration rule that  defines
          the action to abort incomplete multipart uploads.

       Bucket -> (string)
          The  name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated.
          Does not return the access point ARN or access point alias if used.

          When using this action with an access point,  you  must  direct  re-
          quests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes
          the form AccessPointName -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*  .ama-
          zonaws.com.  When using this action with an access point through the
          Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in  place
          of  the  bucket  name. For more information about access point ARNs,
          see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you  must  direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes the  form  AccessPointName  -AccountId  .*outpostID*  .s3-out-
          posts.*Region*  .amazonaws.com.  When  using this action using S3 on
          Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the  Out-
          posts  bucket  ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information
          about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3
          User Guide .

       Key -> (string)
          Object key for which the multipart upload was initiated.

       UploadId -> (string)
          ID for the initiated multipart upload.

       ServerSideEncryption -> (string)
          The  server-side  encryption algorithm used when storing this object
          in Amazon S3 (for example, AES256, aws:kms).

       SSECustomerAlgorithm -> (string)
          If server-side encryption with a  customer-provided  encryption  key
          was  requested, the response will include this header confirming the
          encryption algorithm used.

       SSECustomerKeyMD5 -> (string)
          If server-side encryption with a  customer-provided  encryption  key
          was  requested,  the  response  will  include this header to provide
          round-trip message integrity verification of  the  customer-provided
          encryption key.

       SSEKMSKeyId -> (string)
          If  present, specifies the ID of the Amazon Web Services Key Manage-
          ment Service (Amazon Web Services KMS)  symmetric  customer  managed
          key that was used for the object.

       SSEKMSEncryptionContext -> (string)
          If present, specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS Encryption Context
          to use for  object  encryption.  The  value  of  this  header  is  a
          base64-encoded UTF-8 string holding JSON with the encryption context
          key-value pairs.

       BucketKeyEnabled -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether the multipart upload uses an  S3  Bucket  Key  for
          server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS (SSE-KMS).

       RequestCharged -> (string)
          If  present,  indicates  that the requester was successfully charged
          for the request.
