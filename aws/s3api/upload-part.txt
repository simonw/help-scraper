UPLOAD-PART()                                                    UPLOAD-PART()



NAME
       upload-part -

DESCRIPTION
       Uploads a part in a multipart upload.

       NOTE:
          In  this  operation, you provide part data in your request. However,
          you have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3  object  as  a
          data source for the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an
          existing object, you use the UploadPartCopy operation.

       You must initiate a multipart upload (see CreateMultipartUpload  )  be-
       fore  you  can  upload  any part. In response to your initiate request,
       Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier, that you must  in-
       clude in your upload part request.

       Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part num-
       ber uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within the
       object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part num-
       ber that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part is
       overwritten.  Each  part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the last
       part. There is no size limit on the last part of your multipart upload.

       To ensure that data is not corrupted when traversing the network, spec-
       ify the Content-MD5 header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks
       the part data against the provided MD5 value. If  they  do  not  match,
       Amazon S3 returns an error.

       If  the  upload request is signed with Signature Version 4, then Amazon
       Web Services S3 uses the x-amz-content-sha256 header as a checksum  in-
       stead  of  Content-MD5  .  For  more information see Authenticating Re-
       quests: Using the Authorization Header (Amazon Web  Services  Signature
       Version 4) .
          Note:  After  you  initiate  multipart upload and upload one or more
          parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload  in  order
          to  stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only af-
          ter you either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon  S3  frees
          up the parts storage and stops charging you for the parts storage.

       For more information on multipart uploads, go to Multipart Upload Over-
       view in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       For information on the permissions required to use the multipart upload
       API, go to Multipart Upload and Permissions in the Amazon S3 User Guide
       .

       You can optionally request server-side encryption where Amazon  S3  en-
       crypts  your  data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and de-
       crypts it for you when you access it. You have the option of  providing
       your own encryption key, or you can use the Amazon Web Services managed
       encryption keys. If you choose to provide your own encryption key,  the
       request  headers  you provide in the request must match the headers you
       used   in   the   request   to   initiate   the   upload    by    using
       CreateMultipartUpload  .  For more information, go to Using Server-Side
       Encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       Server-side encryption is supported by the S3 Multipart Upload actions.
       Unless you are using a customer-provided encryption key, you don't need
       to specify the encryption parameters in each  UploadPart  request.  In-
       stead,  you  only need to specify the server-side encryption parameters
       in the initial Initiate Multipart request. For  more  information,  see
       CreateMultipartUpload .

       If  you  requested server-side encryption using a customer-provided en-
       cryption key in your initiate multipart upload request, you  must  pro-
       vide  identical  encryption  information  in each part upload using the
       following headers.

       o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm

       o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key

       o x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --body (blob)
          Object data.

       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated.

          When using this action with an access point,  you  must  direct  re-
          quests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes
          the form AccessPointName -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*  .ama-
          zonaws.com.  When using this action with an access point through the
          Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in  place
          of  the  bucket  name. For more information about access point ARNs,
          see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you  must  direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes the  form  AccessPointName  -AccountId  .*outpostID*  .s3-out-
          posts.*Region*  .amazonaws.com.  When  using this action using S3 on
          Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the  Out-
          posts  bucket  ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information
          about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3
          User Guide .

       --content-length (long)
          Size of the body in bytes. This parameter is useful when the size of
          the body cannot be determined automatically.

       --content-md5 (string)
          The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the part data. This parame-
          ter  is auto-populated when using the command from the CLI. This pa-
          rameter is required if object lock parameters are specified.

       --key (string)
          Object key for which the multipart upload was initiated.

       --part-number (integer)
          Part number of part being uploaded. This is a positive  integer  be-
          tween 1 and 10,000.

       --upload-id (string)
          Upload  ID  identifying the multipart upload whose part is being up-
          loaded.

       --sse-customer-algorithm (string)
          Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting  the  object  (for
          example, AES256).

       --sse-customer-key (string)
          Specifies  the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use
          in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and  then
          it  is  discarded;  Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The
          key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in  the
          x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm  header  . This must
          be the same encryption key specified in the initiate  multipart  up-
          load request.

       --sse-customer-key-md5 (string)
          Specifies  the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to
          RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message  integrity  check
          to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms  that the requester knows that they will be charged for the
          request. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their  re-
          quests.  For  information  about  downloading objects from requester
          pays buckets, see Downloading Objects in Requestor Pays  Buckets  in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP 403  (Ac-
          cess Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command uploads the first part in a multipart upload ini-
       tiated with the create-multipart-upload command:

          aws s3api upload-part --bucket my-bucket --key 'multipart/01' --part-number 1 --body part01 --upload-id  "dfRtDYU0WWCCcH43C3WFbkRONycyCpTJJvxu2i5GYkZljF.Yxwh6XG7WfS2vC4to6HiV6Yjlx.cph0gtNBtJ8P3URCSbB7rjxI5iEwVDmgaXZOGgkk5nVTW16HOQ5l0R"

       The body option takes the name or path of a local file for  upload  (do
       not  use  the file:// prefix). The minimum part size is 5 MB. Upload ID
       is returned by create-multipart-upload and can also be  retrieved  with
       list-multipart-uploads.  Bucket  and  key are specified when you create
       the multipart upload.

       Output:

          {
              "ETag": "\"e868e0f4719e394144ef36531ee6824c\""
          }

       Save the ETag value of each part for later. They are required  to  com-
       plete the multipart upload.

OUTPUT
       ServerSideEncryption -> (string)
          The  server-side  encryption algorithm used when storing this object
          in Amazon S3 (for example, AES256, aws:kms).
