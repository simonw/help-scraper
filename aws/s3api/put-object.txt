PUT-OBJECT()                                                      PUT-OBJECT()



NAME
       put-object -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds an object to a bucket. You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket
       to add an object to it.

       Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if  you  receive  a  success  re-
       sponse, Amazon S3 added the entire object to the bucket.

       Amazon  S3  is  a distributed system. If it receives multiple write re-
       quests for the same object simultaneously, it overwrites  all  but  the
       last  object written. Amazon S3 does not provide object locking; if you
       need this, make sure to build it into your  application  layer  or  use
       versioning instead.

       To  ensure  that  data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the
       Content-MD5 header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the  ob-
       ject  against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, returns
       an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an  ob-
       ject  to  Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5
       value.

       NOTE:

              o To successfully complete the PutObject request, you must  have
                the s3:PutObject in your IAM permissions.

              o To  successfully  change the objects acl of your PutObject re-
                quest, you must have the s3:PutObjectAcl in your  IAM  permis-
                sions.

              o The  Content-MD5  header is required for any request to upload
                an object with a retention period configured using  Amazon  S3
                Object Lock. For more information about Amazon S3 Object Lock,
                see Amazon S3 Object Lock Overview in the Amazon S3 User Guide
                .

          Server-side Encryption

       You can optionally request server-side encryption. With server-side en-
       cryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in  its
       data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. You have the op-
       tion to provide your own encryption key or use Amazon Web Services man-
       aged  encryption  keys  (SSE-S3  or SSE-KMS). For more information, see
       Using Server-Side Encryption .

       If you request server-side encryption using  Amazon  Web  Services  Key
       Management  Service  (SSE-KMS),  you can enable an S3 Bucket Key at the
       object-level. For more information, see Amazon S3 Bucket  Keys  in  the
       Amazon S3 User Guide .
          Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers

       You  can  use  headers to grant ACL- based permissions. By default, all
       objects are private. Only the  owner  has  full  access  control.  When
       adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual Amazon Web
       Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon  S3.  These
       permissions  are then added to the ACL on the object. For more informa-
       tion, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview and  Managing  ACLs  Using
       the REST API .

       If  the  bucket  that you're uploading objects to uses the bucket owner
       enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership,  ACLs  are  disabled  and  no
       longer  affect  permissions.  Buckets that use this setting only accept
       PUT requests that don't specify an ACL or  PUT  requests  that  specify
       bucket  owner  full control ACLs, such as the bucket-owner-full-control
       canned ACL or an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in the XML  for-
       mat.  PUT  requests that contain other ACLs (for example, custom grants
       to certain Amazon Web Services accounts) fail and return  a  400  error
       with the error code AccessControlListNotSupported .

       For  more  information,  see  Controlling ownership of objects and dis-
       abling ACLs in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       NOTE:
              If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for Object
              Ownership, all objects written to the bucket by any account will
              be owned by the bucket owner.

          Storage Class Options

       By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class  to  store  newly
       created  objects.  The  STANDARD storage class provides high durability
       and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can  specify
       a different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS
       Storage Class. For more information, see Storage Classes in the  Amazon
       S3 User Guide .
          Versioning

       If  you  enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically gener-
       ates a unique version ID for the object being stored. Amazon S3 returns
       this  ID  in  the response. When you enable versioning for a bucket, if
       Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simulta-
       neously, it stores all of the objects.

       For more information about versioning, see Adding Objects to Versioning
       Enabled Buckets . For information about returning the versioning  state
       of a bucket, see GetBucketVersioning .

          Canned ACL .

          This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          Possible values:

          o private

          o public-read

          o public-read-write

          o authenticated-read

          o aws-exec-read

          o bucket-owner-read

          o bucket-owner-full-control

       --body (blob)
          Object data.

       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name to which the PUT action was initiated.

          When using this action with an access point,  you  must  direct  re-
          quests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes
          the form AccessPointName -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*  .ama-
          zonaws.com.  When using this action with an access point through the
          Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in  place
          of  the  bucket  name. For more information about access point ARNs,
          see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you  must  direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes the  form  AccessPointName  -AccountId  .*outpostID*  .s3-out-
          posts.*Region*  .amazonaws.com.  When  using this action using S3 on
          Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the  Out-
          posts  bucket  ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information
          about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3
          User Guide .

       --cache-control (string)
          Can  be  used  to  specify  caching behavior along the request/reply
          chain.          For          more          information,          see

       --content-disposition (string)
          Specifies presentational information for the object. For more infor-
          mation,                                                          see
          http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec19.html#sec19.5.1 .

       --content-encoding (string)
          Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and
          thus what decoding mechanisms must be  applied  to  obtain  the  me-
          dia-type  referenced  by the Content-Type header field. For more in-
          formation,                                                       see
          http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.11 .

       --content-language (string)
          The language the content is in.

       --content-length (long)
          Size of the body in bytes. This parameter is useful when the size of
          the body cannot be determined automatically. For  more  information,
          see  http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.13
          .

       --content-md5 (string)
          The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the  message  (without  the
          headers) according to RFC 1864. This header can be used as a message
          integrity check to verify that the data is the same  data  that  was
          originally  sent.  Although  it  is optional, we recommend using the
          Content-MD5 mechanism as an end-to-end integrity check. For more in-
          formation about REST request authentication, see REST Authentication
          .

       --content-type (string)
          A standard MIME type describing the format of the contents. For more
          information,                                                     see

          This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       --grant-read (string)
          Allows grantee to read the object data and its metadata.

          This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       --grant-read-acp (string)
          Allows grantee to read the object ACL.

          This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       --key (string)
          Object key for which the PUT action was initiated.

       --metadata (map)
          A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --server-side-encryption (string)
          The  server-side  encryption algorithm used when storing this object
          in Amazon S3 (for example, AES256, aws:kms).

          Possible values:

          o AES256

          o aws:kms

       --storage-class (string)
          By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly
          created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability
          and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can spec-
          ify  a  different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the
          OUTPOSTS Storage Class. For more information, see Storage Classes in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o STANDARD

          o REDUCED_REDUNDANCY

          o DEEP_ARCHIVE

          o OUTPOSTS

          o GLACIER_IR

       --website-redirect-location (string)
          If  the  bucket  is  configured as a website, redirects requests for
          this object to another object in the same bucket or to  an  external
          URL.  Amazon  S3 stores the value of this header in the object meta-
          data. For information about object  metadata,  see  Object  Key  and
          Metadata .

          In the following example, the request header sets the redirect to an
          object (anotherPage.html) in the same bucket:
              x-amz-website-redirect-location: /anotherPage.html

          In the following example, the request header sets the  object  redi-
          rect to another website:
              x-amz-website-redirect-location: http://www.example.com/

          For more information about website hosting in Amazon S3, see Hosting
          Websites on Amazon S3 and How to Configure Website Page Redirects .

       --sse-customer-algorithm (string)
          Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting  the  object  (for
          example, AES256).

       --sse-customer-key (string)
          Specifies  the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use
          in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and  then
          it  is  discarded;  Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The
          key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in  the
          x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm header.

       --sse-customer-key-md5 (string)
          Specifies  the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to
          RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message  integrity  check
          to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

       --ssekms-key-id (string)
          If  x-amz-server-side-encryption  is  present  and  has the value of
          aws:kms , this header specifies the ID of the  Amazon  Web  Services
          Key  Management  Service  (Amazon Web Services KMS) symmetrical cus-
          tomer managed key that was used  for  the  object.  If  you  specify
          x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms    ,    but    do    not   pro-
          vide``x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`` , Amazon S3 uses
          the  Amazon Web Services managed key to protect the data. If the KMS
          key does not exist in the same account issuing the command, you must
          use the full ARN and not just the ID.

       --ssekms-encryption-context (string)
          Specifies  the Amazon Web Services KMS Encryption Context to use for
          object encryption. The value of  this  header  is  a  base64-encoded
          UTF-8  string  holding  JSON  with  the encryption context key-value
          pairs.

       --bucket-key-enabled | --no-bucket-key-enabled (boolean)
          Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key  for  object
          encryption with server-side encryption using AWS KMS (SSE-KMS). Set-
          ting this header to true causes Amazon S3 to use an  S3  Bucket  Key
          for object encryption with SSE-KMS.

          Specifying  this header with a PUT action doesnt affect bucket-level
          settings for S3 Bucket Key.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for  the
          request.  Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their re-
          quests. For information about  downloading  objects  from  requester
          pays  buckets,  see Downloading Objects in Requestor Pays Buckets in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --tagging (string)
          The tag-set for the object. The tag-set must be encoded as URL Query
          parameters. (For example, "Key1=Value1")

       --object-lock-mode (string)
          The Object Lock mode that you want to apply to this object.

          Possible values:

          o GOVERNANCE

          o COMPLIANCE

       --object-lock-retain-until-date (timestamp)
          The date and time when you want this object's Object Lock to expire.
          Must be formatted as a timestamp parameter.

       --object-lock-legal-hold-status (string)
          Specifies whether a legal hold will be applied to this  object.  For
          more information about S3 Object Lock, see Object Lock .

          Possible values:

          o ON

          o OFF

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP 403  (Ac-
          cess Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  example uses the put-object command to upload an object
       to Amazon S3:

          aws s3api put-object --bucket text-content --key dir-1/my_images.tar.bz2 --body my_images.tar.bz2

       The following example shows an upload of a video file (The  video  file
       is specified using Windows file system syntax.):

          aws s3api put-object --bucket text-content --key dir-1/big-video-file.mp4 --body e:\media\videos\f-sharp-3-data-services.mp4

       For  more information about uploading objects, see Uploading Objects in
       the Amazon S3 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       Expiration -> (string)
          If   the   expiration   is   configured   for   the   object    (see
          PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration   ),   the  response  includes  this
          header. It includes the expiry-date and rule-id key-value pairs that
          provide  information  about  object  expiration.  The  value  of the
          rule-id is URL encoded.

       ETag -> (string)
          Entity tag for the uploaded object.

       ServerSideEncryption -> (string)
          If you specified server-side encryption either with  an  Amazon  Web
          Services KMS key or Amazon S3-managed encryption key in your PUT re-
          quest, the response includes this header. It confirms the encryption
          algorithm that Amazon S3 used to encrypt the object.

       VersionId -> (string)
          Version of the object.

       SSECustomerAlgorithm -> (string)
          If  server-side  encryption  with a customer-provided encryption key
          was requested, the response will include this header confirming  the
          encryption algorithm used.
