UPLOAD-PART-COPY()                                          UPLOAD-PART-COPY()



NAME
       upload-part-copy -

DESCRIPTION
       Uploads  a part by copying data from an existing object as data source.
       You  specify  the  data   source   by   adding   the   request   header
       x-amz-copy-source  in  your  request and a byte range by adding the re-
       quest header x-amz-copy-source-range in your request.

       The minimum allowable part size for a multipart upload  is  5  MB.  For
       more  information  about  multipart upload limits, go to Quick Facts in
       the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       NOTE:
          Instead of using an existing object as part data, you might use  the
          UploadPart action and provide data in your request.

       You must initiate a multipart upload before you can upload any part. In
       response to your initiate request. Amazon S3 returns a  unique  identi-
       fier, the upload ID, that you must include in your upload part request.

       For  more information about using the UploadPartCopy operation, see the
       following:

       o For conceptual information about multipart uploads, see Uploading Ob-
         jects Using Multipart Upload in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       o For  information  about permissions required to use the multipart up-
         load API, see Multipart Upload and Permissions in the Amazon S3  User
         Guide .

       o For  information  about  copying objects using a single atomic action
         vs. the multipart upload, see Operations on Objects in the Amazon  S3
         User Guide .

       o For information about using server-side encryption with customer-pro-
         vided  encryption  keys  with  the  UploadPartCopy   operation,   see
         CopyObject and UploadPart .

       Note  the following additional considerations about the request headers
       x-amz-copy-source-if-match    ,    x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match    ,
       x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since  , and x-amz-copy-source-if-modi-
       fied-since :

       o Consideration 1 -  If  both  of  the  x-amz-copy-source-if-match  and
         x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since  headers are present in the re-
         quest as follows:  x-amz-copy-source-if-match condition evaluates  to
         true  ,  and;  x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since condition evalu-
         ates to false ; Amazon S3 returns 200 OK and copies the data.

       o Consideration 2 - If both of the x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match  and
         x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since  headers  are  present in the re-
         quest as follows:  x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match  condition  evalu-
         ates  to  false , and;  x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since condition
         evaluates to true ; Amazon S3 returns  412  Precondition  Failed  re-
         sponse code.
          Versioning

       If your bucket has versioning enabled, you could have multiple versions
       of the same object. By default, x-amz-copy-source identifies  the  cur-
       rent  version of the object to copy. If the current version is a delete
       marker and you don't specify a versionId  in  the  x-amz-copy-source  ,
       Amazon  S3  returns  a 404 error, because the object does not exist. If
       you specify versionId in the x-amz-copy-source and the versionId  is  a
       delete marker, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP 400 error, because you are not
       allowed  to  specify  a  delete   marker   as   a   version   for   the
       x-amz-copy-source .

       You  can  optionally specify a specific version of the source object to
       copy by adding the versionId subresource as shown in the following  ex-
       ample:
          x-amz-copy-source: /bucket/object?versionId=version id

          Special Errors

       o

         o Code: NoSuchUpload

         o Cause: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The upload ID
           might be invalid, or the multipart upload might have  been  aborted
           or completed.

         o HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found

       o

            o Code: InvalidRequest

            o Cause:   The  specified  copy  source  is  not  supported  as  a
              byte-range copy source.

            o HTTP Status Code: 400 Bad Request

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name.

          When using this action with an access point,  you  must  direct  re-
          quests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes
          the form AccessPointName -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*  .ama-
          zonaws.com.  When using this action with an access point through the
          Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in  place
          of  the  bucket  name. For more information about access point ARNs,
          see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you  must  direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes the  form  AccessPointName  -AccountId  .*outpostID*  .s3-out-
          posts.*Region*  .amazonaws.com.  When  using this action using S3 on
          Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the  Out-
          posts  bucket  ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information
          about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3
          User Guide .

       --copy-source (string)
          Specifies  the source object for the copy operation. You specify the
          value in one of two formats, depending on whether you want to access
          the source object through an access point :

          o For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name
            of the source bucket and key of the source object, separated by  a
            slash  (/).  For  example,  to copy the object reports/january.pdf
            from  the  bucket  awsexamplebucket  ,  use   awsexamplebucket/re-
            ports/january.pdf . The value must be URL encoded.

          o For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon Re-
            source Name (ARN) of the object as  accessed  through  the  access
            point,   in  the  format  arn:aws:s3:<Region>:<account-id>:access-
            point/<access-point-name>/object/<key> . For example, to copy  the
            object  reports/january.pdf  through  access point my-access-point
            owned by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2 ,  use  the  URL
            encoding  of  arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-ac-
            cess-point/object/reports/january.pdf . The value must be URL  en-
            coded.

          NOTE:
                 Amazon  S3  supports copy operations using access points only
                 when the source and destination buckets are in the same  Ama-
                 zon Web Services Region.

              Alternatively,  for  objects  accessed through Amazon S3 on Out-
              posts, specify the ARN of the object as accessed in  the  format
              arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<out-
              post-id>/object/<key> . For example,  to  copy  the  object  re-
              ports/january.pdf  through  outpost  my-outpost owned by account
              123456789012 in Region us-west-2  ,  use  the  URL  encoding  of
              arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-out-
              post/object/reports/january.pdf . The value must be URL encoded.

          To copy a specific version of  an  object,  append  ?versionId=<ver-
          sion-id>  to  the value (for example, awsexamplebucket/reports/janu-
          ary.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893  ).   If   you
          don't  specify  a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest version of
          the source object.

       --copy-source-if-match (string)
          Copies the object if its entity tag  (ETag)  matches  the  specified
          tag.

       --copy-source-if-modified-since (timestamp)
          Copies the object if it has been modified since the specified time.

       --copy-source-if-none-match (string)
          Copies  the  object  if  its entity tag (ETag) is different than the
          specified ETag.

       --copy-source-if-unmodified-since (timestamp)
          Copies the object if it hasn't been  modified  since  the  specified
          time.

       --copy-source-range (string)
          The  range  of bytes to copy from the source object. The range value
          must use the form bytes=first-last, where the first and last are the
          zero-based  byte  offsets  to copy. For example, bytes=0-9 indicates
          that you want to copy the first 10 bytes of the source. You can copy
          a range only if the source object is greater than 5 MB.

       --key (string)
          Object key for which the multipart upload was initiated.

       --part-number (integer)
          Part number of part being copied. This is a positive integer between
          1 and 10,000.

       --upload-id (string)
          Upload ID identifying the  multipart  upload  whose  part  is  being
          copied.

       --sse-customer-algorithm (string)
          Specifies  the  algorithm  to use to when encrypting the object (for
          example, AES256).

       --sse-customer-key (string)
          Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to  use
          in  encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then
          it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the  encryption  key.  The
          key  must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
          x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm header. This must be
          the  same  encryption key specified in the initiate multipart upload
          request.

       --sse-customer-key-md5 (string)
          Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according  to
          RFC  1321.  Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check
          to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

       --copy-source-sse-customer-algorithm (string)
          Specifies the algorithm to use when  decrypting  the  source  object
          (for example, AES256).

       --copy-source-sse-customer-key (string)
          Specifies  the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use
          to decrypt the source object. The encryption key  provided  in  this
          header must be one that was used when the source object was created.

       --copy-source-sse-customer-key-md5 (string)
          Specifies  the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to
          RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message  integrity  check
          to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms  that the requester knows that they will be charged for the
          request. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their  re-
          quests.  For  information  about  downloading objects from requester
          pays buckets, see Downloading Objects in Requestor Pays  Buckets  in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected destination bucket owner. If the des-
          tination bucket is owned by a different account,  the  request  will
          fail with an HTTP 403 (Access Denied) error.

       --expected-source-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account  ID  of the expected source bucket owner. If the source
          bucket is owned by a different account, the request will  fail  with
          an HTTP 403 (Access Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
