PUT-PUBLIC-ACCESS-BLOCK()                            PUT-PUBLIC-ACCESS-BLOCK()



NAME
       put-public-access-block -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  or  modifies the PublicAccessBlock configuration for an Amazon
       S3 bucket. To use this operation, you must have the  s3:PutBucketPubli-
       cAccessBlock  permission.  For more information about Amazon S3 permis-
       sions, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy .

       WARNING:
          When Amazon S3 evaluates the PublicAccessBlock configuration  for  a
          bucket  or  an object, it checks the PublicAccessBlock configuration
          for both the bucket (or the bucket that contains the object) and the
          bucket  owner's account. If the PublicAccessBlock configurations are
          different between the bucket and the account,  Amazon  S3  uses  the
          most  restrictive  combination of the bucket-level and account-level
          settings.

       For more information about when Amazon S3 considers a bucket or an  ob-
       ject public, see The Meaning of "Public" .

SYNOPSIS
            put-public-access-block
          --bucket <value>
          [--content-md5 <value>]
          --public-access-block-configuration <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The  name of the Amazon S3 bucket whose PublicAccessBlock configura-
          tion you want to set.

       --content-md5 (string)
          The MD5 hash of the PutPublicAccessBlock request body.

          For requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line  Inter-
          face (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated au-
          tomatically.

       --public-access-block-configuration (structure)
          The PublicAccessBlock configuration that you want to apply  to  this
          Amazon  S3  bucket.  You can enable the configuration options in any
          combination. For more information about when Amazon S3  considers  a
          bucket  or  object public, see The Meaning of "Public" in the Amazon
          S3 User Guide .

          BlockPublicAcls -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public  access  control
              lists (ACLs) for this bucket and objects in this bucket. Setting
              this element to TRUE causes the following behavior:

              o PUT Bucket acl and PUT Object acl calls fail if the  specified
                ACL is public.

              o PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

              o PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing policies or ACLs.

          IgnorePublicAcls -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for this
              bucket and objects in this bucket. Setting this element to  TRUE
              causes  Amazon  S3  to ignore all public ACLs on this bucket and
              objects in this bucket.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect the persistence of any  ex-
              isting ACLs and doesn't prevent new public ACLs from being set.

          BlockPublicPolicy -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket policies
              for this bucket. Setting this element to TRUE causes  Amazon  S3
              to  reject  calls  to  PUT Bucket policy if the specified bucket
              policy allows public access.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing bucket policies.

          RestrictPublicBuckets -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should restrict public bucket  poli-
              cies for this bucket. Setting this element to TRUE restricts ac-
              cess to this bucket to only Amazon Web  Service  principals  and
              authorized  users within this account if the bucket has a public
              policy.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect  previously  stored  bucket
              policies, except that public and cross-account access within any
              public bucket policy, including non-public  delegation  to  spe-
              cific accounts, is blocked.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          BlockPublicAcls=boolean,IgnorePublicAcls=boolean,BlockPublicPolicy=boolean,RestrictPublicBuckets=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "BlockPublicAcls": true|false,
            "IgnorePublicAcls": true|false,
            "BlockPublicPolicy": true|false,
            "RestrictPublicBuckets": true|false
          }

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP 403  (Ac-
          cess Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To set the block public access configuration for a bucket

       The  following put-public-access-block example sets a restrictive block
       public access configuration for the specified bucket.

          aws s3api put-public-access-block \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --public-access-block-configuration "BlockPublicAcls=true,IgnorePublicAcls=true,BlockPublicPolicy=true,RestrictPublicBuckets=true"

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
