PUT-BUCKET-METRICS-CONFIGURATION()          PUT-BUCKET-METRICS-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       put-bucket-metrics-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets  a  metrics  configuration (specified by the metrics configuration
       ID) for the bucket. You can have up to 1,000 metrics configurations per
       bucket. If you're updating an existing metrics configuration, note that
       this is a full replacement of the existing  metrics  configuration.  If
       you don't include the elements you want to keep, they are erased.

       To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3:Put-
       MetricsConfiguration action. The bucket owner has  this  permission  by
       default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more
       information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subre-
       source Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Re-
       sources .

       For information about CloudWatch request metrics  for  Amazon  S3,  see
       Monitoring Metrics with Amazon CloudWatch .

          GetBucketLifecycle has the following special error:

       o Error code: TooManyConfigurations

         o Description:  You  are attempting to create a new configuration but
           have already reached the 1,000-configuration limit.

SYNOPSIS
            put-bucket-metrics-configuration
          --bucket <value>
          --id <value>
          --metrics-configuration <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket for which the metrics configuration is set.

       --id (string)
          The ID used to identify the metrics configuration.

       --metrics-configuration (structure)
          Specifies the metrics configuration.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID used to identify the metrics configuration.

          Filter -> (structure)
              Specifies a metrics configuration filter. The metrics configura-
              tion  will only include objects that meet the filter's criteria.
              A filter must be a prefix, an object tag, an access  point  ARN,
              or a conjunction (MetricsAndOperator).

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The prefix used when evaluating a metrics filter.

              Tag -> (structure)
                 The tag used when evaluating a metrics filter.

                 Key -> (string)
                     Name of the object key.

                 Value -> (string)
                     Value of the tag.

              AccessPointArn -> (string)
                 The access point ARN used when evaluating a metrics filter.

              And -> (structure)
                 A  conjunction  (logical AND) of predicates, which is used in
                 evaluating a metrics filter. The operator must have at  least
                 two  predicates,  and  an object must match all of the predi-
                 cates in order for the filter to apply.

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     The prefix used when evaluating an AND predicate.

                 Tags -> (list)
                     The list of tags used when evaluating an AND predicate.

                     (structure)
                        A container of a key value name pair.

                        Key -> (string)
                            Name of the object key.

                        Value -> (string)
                            Value of the tag.

                 AccessPointArn -> (string)
                     The access point ARN used when evaluating an  AND  predi-
                     cate.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Id": "string",
            "Filter": {
              "Prefix": "string",
              "Tag": {
                "Key": "string",
                "Value": "string"
              },
              "AccessPointArn": "string",
              "And": {
                "Prefix": "string",
                "Tags": [
                  {
                    "Key": "string",
                    "Value": "string"
                  }
                  ...
                ],
                "AccessPointArn": "string"
              }
            }
          }

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status  code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To set a metrics configuration for a bucket

       The  following  put-bucket-metrics-configuration  example sets a metric
       configuration with ID 123 for the specified bucket.

          aws s3api put-bucket-metrics-configuration \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --id 123 \
              --metrics-configuration '{"Id": "123", "Filter": {"Prefix": "logs"}}'

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
