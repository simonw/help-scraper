LIST-OBJECTS-V2()                                            LIST-OBJECTS-V2()



NAME
       list-objects-v2 -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  some or all (up to 1,000) of the objects in a bucket with each
       request. You can use the request parameters as  selection  criteria  to
       return  a subset of the objects in a bucket. A 200 OK response can con-
       tain valid or invalid XML. Make sure  to  design  your  application  to
       parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately. Objects
       are returned sorted in an ascending order of the respective  key  names
       in  the  list.  For more information about listing objects, see Listing
       object keys programmatically

       To use this operation, you must have READ access to the bucket.

       To use this action in an Identity and Access Management  (IAM)  policy,
       you  must  have  permissions  to  perform the s3:ListBucket action. The
       bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this  permis-
       sion to others. For more information about permissions, see Permissions
       Related to Bucket Subresource Operations and  Managing  Access  Permis-
       sions to Your Amazon S3 Resources .

       WARNING:
          This section describes the latest revision of this action. We recom-
          mend that you use this revised API for application development.  For
          backward  compatibility,  Amazon  S3  continues to support the prior
          version of this API, ListObjects .

       To get a list of your buckets, see ListBuckets .

       The following operations are related to ListObjectsV2 :

       o GetObject

       o PutObject

       o CreateBucket

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-objects-v2 is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Contents, CommonPrefixes

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          Bucket name to list.

          When  using  this  action  with an access point, you must direct re-
          quests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes
          the  form  AccessPointName -AccountId .s3-accesspoint.*Region* .ama-
          zonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through  the
          Amazon  Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place
          of the bucket name. For more information about  access  point  ARNs,
          see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When  using  this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes  the  form `` AccessPointName -AccountId .*outpostID* .s3-out-
          posts.*Region* .amazonaws.com`` . When using this action with S3  on
          Outposts  through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Out-
          posts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For  more  information
          about  S3  on  Outposts ARNs, see Using Amazon S3 on Outposts in the
          Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --delimiter (string)
          A delimiter is a character you use to group keys.

       --encoding-type (string)
          Encoding type used by Amazon S3 to encode object  keys  in  the  re-
          sponse.

          Possible values:

          o url

       --prefix (string)
          Limits the response to keys that begin with the specified prefix.

       --fetch-owner | --no-fetch-owner (boolean)
          The  owner field is not present in listV2 by default, if you want to
          return owner field with each key in the result then  set  the  fetch
          owner field to true.

       --start-after (string)
          StartAfter is where you want Amazon S3 to start listing from. Amazon
          S3 starts listing after this specified key. StartAfter  can  be  any
          key in the bucket.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that she or he will be charged for
          the list objects request in V2 style. Bucket owners need not specify
          this parameter in their requests.

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status  code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          Set  to  false  if  all of the results were returned. Set to true if
          more keys are available to return. If the number of results  exceeds
          that specified by MaxKeys, all of the results might not be returned.

       Contents -> (list)
          Metadata about each object returned.

          (structure)
              An object consists of data and its descriptive metadata.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name that you assign to an object. You use the object key
                 to retrieve the object.

              LastModified -> (timestamp)
                 Creation date of the object.

              ETag -> (string)
                 The entity tag is a hash of the  object.  The  ETag  reflects
                 changes  only to the contents of an object, not its metadata.
                 The ETag may or may not be an MD5 digest of the object  data.
                 Whether  or  not  it is depends on how the object was created
                 and how it is encrypted as described below:

                 o Objects created by the PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy op-
                   eration, or through the Amazon Web Services Management Con-
                   sole, and are encrypted by SSE-S3 or plaintext, have  ETags
                   that are an MD5 digest of their object data.

                 o Objects created by the PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy op-
                   eration, or through the Amazon Web Services Management Con-
                   sole,  and  are  encrypted  by SSE-C or SSE-KMS, have ETags
                   that are not an MD5 digest of their object data.

                 o If an object is created by either the Multipart  Upload  or
                   Part Copy operation, the ETag is not an MD5 digest, regard-
                   less of the method of encryption. If an  object  is  larger
                   than 16 MB, the Amazon Web Services Management Console will
                   upload or copy that  object  as  a  Multipart  Upload,  and
                   therefore the ETag will not be an MD5 digest.

              ChecksumAlgorithm -> (list)
                 The  algorithm  that was used to create a checksum of the ob-
                 ject.

                 (string)

              Size -> (integer)
                 Size in bytes of the object

              StorageClass -> (string)
                 The class of storage used to store the object.

              Owner -> (structure)
                 The owner of the object

                 DisplayName -> (string)
                     Container for the display name of the owner.

                 ID -> (string)
                     Container for the ID of the owner.

       Name -> (string)
          The bucket name.

          When using this action with an access point,  you  must  direct  re-
          quests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes
          the form AccessPointName -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*  .ama-
          zonaws.com.  When using this action with an access point through the
          Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in  place
          of  the  bucket  name. For more information about access point ARNs,
          see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you  must  direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes the form `` AccessPointName -AccountId  .*outpostID*  .s3-out-
          posts.*Region*  .amazonaws.com`` . When using this action with S3 on
          Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the  Out-
          posts  bucket  ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information
          about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using Amazon S3 on  Outposts  in  the
          Amazon S3 User Guide .

       Prefix -> (string)
          Keys that begin with the indicated prefix.

       Delimiter -> (string)
          Causes  keys that contain the same string between the prefix and the
          first occurrence of the delimiter to be rolled up into a single  re-
          sult  element in the CommonPrefixes collection. These rolled-up keys
          are not returned elsewhere in the response.  Each  rolled-up  result
          counts as only one return against the MaxKeys value.

       MaxKeys -> (integer)
          Sets the maximum number of keys returned in the response. By default
          the action returns up to 1,000 key names. The response might contain
          fewer keys but will never contain more.

       CommonPrefixes -> (list)
          All  of  the keys (up to 1,000) rolled up into a common prefix count
          as a single return when calculating the number of returns.

          A response can contain CommonPrefixes only if you specify  a  delim-
          iter.
              CommonPrefixes contains all (if there are any) keys between Pre-
              fix and the next occurrence of the string specified by a  delim-
              iter.

              CommonPrefixes  lists  keys  that act like subdirectories in the
              directory specified by Prefix .

          For example, if the prefix is notes/ and the delimiter is a slash (/
          ) as in notes/summer/july , the common prefix is notes/summer/ . All
          of the keys that roll up into a common prefix count as a single  re-
          turn when calculating the number of returns.

          (structure)
              Container for all (if there are any) keys between Prefix and the
              next occurrence of the string specified by a delimiter.  Common-
              Prefixes  lists  keys that act like subdirectories in the direc-
              tory specified by Prefix. For example, if the prefix  is  notes/
              and  the  delimiter  is a slash (/) as in notes/summer/july, the
              common prefix is notes/summer/.

              Prefix -> (string)
                 Container for the specified common prefix.

       EncodingType -> (string)
          Encoding type used by Amazon S3 to encode object key  names  in  the
          XML response.

          If  you  specify  the encoding-type request parameter, Amazon S3 in-
          cludes this element in the response, and returns  encoded  key  name
          values in the following response elements:
              Delimiter, Prefix, Key, and StartAfter .

       KeyCount -> (integer)
          KeyCount  is the number of keys returned with this request. KeyCount
          will always be less than or equals to MaxKeys field. Say you ask for
          50 keys, your result will include less than equals 50 keys

       ContinuationToken -> (string)
          If  ContinuationToken  was  sent with the request, it is included in
          the response.

       NextContinuationToken -> (string)
          NextContinuationToken is sent when isTruncated is true, which  means
          there  are more keys in the bucket that can be listed. The next list
          requests to Amazon S3 can be continued with this NextContinuationTo-
          ken . NextContinuationToken is obfuscated and is not a real key

       StartAfter -> (string)
          If  StartAfter  was sent with the request, it is included in the re-
          sponse.



                                                             LIST-OBJECTS-V2()
