GET-BUCKET-ACL()                                              GET-BUCKET-ACL()



NAME
       get-bucket-acl -

DESCRIPTION
       This  implementation  of the GET action uses the acl subresource to re-
       turn the access control list (ACL) of a bucket. To use  GET  to  return
       the  ACL of the bucket, you must have READ_ACP access to the bucket. If
       READ_ACP permission is granted to the anonymous user,  you  can  return
       the ACL of the bucket without using an authorization header.

       NOTE:
              If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Ob-
              ject Ownership, requests to read ACLs are  still  supported  and
              return  the  bucket-owner-full-control  ACL with the owner being
              the account that created the bucket. For more  information,  see
              Controlling object ownership and disabling ACLs in the Amazon S3
              User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-acl
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          Specifies the S3 bucket whose ACL is being requested.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       named my-bucket:
