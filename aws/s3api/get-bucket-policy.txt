GET-BUCKET-POLICY()                                        GET-BUCKET-POLICY()



NAME
       get-bucket-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the policy of a specified bucket. If you are using an identity
       other than the root user of the Amazon Web Services account  that  owns
       the  bucket, the calling identity must have the GetBucketPolicy permis-
       sions on the specified bucket and belong to the bucket owner's  account
       in order to use this operation.

       If  you don't have GetBucketPolicy permissions, Amazon S3 returns a 403
       Access Denied error. If you have the correct  permissions,  but  you're
       not  using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Ama-
       zon S3 returns a 405 Method Not Allowed error.

       WARNING:
          As a security precaution, the root user of the Amazon  Web  Services
          account  that  owns  a bucket can always use this operation, even if
          the policy explicitly denies the root user the  ability  to  perform
          this action.

       For  more  information about bucket policies, see Using Bucket Policies
       and User Policies .

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-policy
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name for which to get the bucket policy.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  command  retrieves the bucket policy for a bucket named
       my-bucket:

          aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "Policy": "{\"Version\":\"2008-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"\",\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":\"*\",\"Action\":\"s3:GetObject\",\"Resource\":\"arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*\"},{\"Sid\":\"\",\"Effect\":\"Deny\",\"Principal\":\"*\",\"Action\":\"s3:GetObject\",\"Resource\":\"arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/secret/*\"}]}"
          }

   Get and put a bucket policy
       The following example shows how you can download an  Amazon  S3  bucket
       policy,  make modifications to the file, and then use put-bucket-policy
       to apply the modified bucket policy.  To download the bucket policy  to
       a file, you can run:

          aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket mybucket --query Policy --output text > policy.json

       You  can  then  modify the policy.json file as needed.  Finally you can
       apply this modified policy back to the S3 bucket by running:

          aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket mybucket --policy file://policy.json

OUTPUT
       Policy -> (string)
          The bucket policy as a JSON document.
