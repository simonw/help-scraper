LIST-BUCKET-ANALYTICS-CONFIGURATIONS()  LIST-BUCKET-ANALYTICS-CONFIGURATIONS()



NAME
       list-bucket-analytics-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  analytics configurations for the bucket. You can have up to
       1,000 analytics configurations per bucket.

       This action supports list pagination and does not return more than  100
       configurations  at a time. You should always check the IsTruncated ele-
       ment in the response. If there are  no  more  configurations  to  list,
       IsTruncated  is set to false. If there are more configurations to list,
       IsTruncated is set to true, and there will be a value in  NextContinua-
       tionToken  .  You  use  the NextContinuationToken value to continue the
       pagination of the list by passing the value  in  continuation-token  in
       the request to GET the next page.

       To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3:Get-
       AnalyticsConfiguration action. The bucket owner has this permission  by
       default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more
       information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subre-
       source Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Re-
       sources .

       For information about Amazon S3 analytics feature, see Amazon  S3  Ana-
       lytics  Storage Class Analysis .

SYNOPSIS
            list-bucket-analytics-configurations
          --bucket <value>
          [--continuation-token <value>]
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket from which analytics configurations  are  re-
          trieved.

       --continuation-token (string)
          The  ContinuationToken that represents a placeholder from where this
          request should begin.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP 403 (Ac-
          cess Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve a list of analytics configurations for a bucket

       The following list-bucket-analytics-configurations retrieves a list  of
       analytics configurations for the specified bucket.

          aws s3api list-bucket-analytics-configurations \
              --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "AnalyticsConfigurationList": [
                  {
                      "StorageClassAnalysis": {},
                      "Id": "1"
                  }
              ],
              "IsTruncated": false
          }

OUTPUT
       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  the returned list of analytics configurations is
          complete. A value of true indicates that the list  is  not  complete
          and  the NextContinuationToken will be provided for a subsequent re-
          quest.

       ContinuationToken -> (string)
          The marker that is used as a starting point for this analytics  con-
          figuration  list  response.  This value is present if it was sent in
          the request.

       NextContinuationToken -> (string)
          NextContinuationToken is sent when isTruncated is true, which  indi-
          cates that there are more analytics configurations to list. The next
          request must include this NextContinuationToken . The token  is  ob-
          fuscated and is not a usable value.

       AnalyticsConfigurationList -> (list)
          The list of analytics configurations for a bucket.

          (structure)

                                   prevent  problems if the destination bucket
                                   ownership changes.
