PUT-BUCKET-NOTIFICATION-CONFIGURATION()PUT-BUCKET-NOTIFICATION-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       put-bucket-notification-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Enables notifications of specified events for a bucket. For more infor-
       mation about event notifications, see Configuring Event Notifications .

       Using this API, you can replace an existing notification configuration.
       The  configuration is an XML file that defines the event types that you
       want Amazon S3 to publish and the destination where you want Amazon  S3
       to publish an event notification when it detects an event of the speci-
       fied type.

       By default, your bucket has no event notifications configured. That is,
       the  notification configuration will be an empty NotificationConfigura-
       tion .
          <NotificationConfiguration>

          </NotificationConfiguration>

       This action replaces the existing notification configuration  with  the
       configuration you include in the request body.

       After  Amazon S3 receives this request, it first verifies that any Ama-
       zon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)  or  Amazon  Simple  Queue
       Service  (Amazon SQS) destination exists, and that the bucket owner has
       permission to publish to it by sending a test notification. In the case
       of  Lambda  destinations,  Amazon  S3 verifies that the Lambda function
       permissions grant Amazon S3 permission to invoke the function from  the
       Amazon  S3  bucket. For more information, see Configuring Notifications
       for Amazon S3 Events .

       You can disable notifications by adding the empty  NotificationConfigu-
       ration element.

       For  more information about the number of event notification configura-
       tions that you can create per bucket, see Amazon S3 service  quotas  in
       Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       By  default,  only  the  bucket  owner can configure notifications on a
       bucket. However, bucket owners can use a bucket policy to grant permis-
       sion  to other users to set this configuration with s3:PutBucketNotifi-
       cation permission.

       NOTE:
              The PUT notification is an atomic operation. For  example,  sup-
              pose  your  notification  configuration  includes SNS topic, SQS
              queue, and Lambda function configurations. When you send  a  PUT
              request  with  this configuration, Amazon S3 sends test messages
              to your SNS topic. If the message fails, the entire  PUT  action
              will  fail, and Amazon S3 will not add the configuration to your
              bucket.

          Responses

       If the configuration in the request body includes only one TopicConfig-
       uration  specifying only the s3:ReducedRedundancyLostObject event type,
       the response will also  include  the  x-amz-sns-test-message-id  header
       containing the message ID of the test notification sent to the topic.

          Skips validation of Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS, and Lambda destinations.
          True or false value.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The applies a notification configuration to a bucket named my-bucket:

          aws s3api put-bucket-notification-configuration --bucket my-bucket --notification-configuration file://notification.json

       The file notification.json is a JSON document  in  the  current  folder
       that specifies an SNS topic and an event type to monitor:

           {
              "TopicConfigurations": [
                  {
                      "TopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:s3-notification-topic",
                      "Events": [
                          "s3:ObjectCreated:*"
                      ]
                  }
              ]
          }

       The SNS topic must have an IAM policy attached to it that allows Amazon
       S3 to publish to it:

          {
           "Version": "2008-10-17",
           "Id": "example-ID",
           "Statement": [
            {
             "Sid": "example-statement-ID",
             "Effect": "Allow",
             "Principal": {
               "Service": "s3.amazonaws.com"
             },
             "Action": [
              "SNS:Publish"
             ],
             "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:my-bucket",
             "Condition": {
                "ArnLike": {
                "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:s3:*:*:my-bucket"
              }
             }
            }
           ]
          }

OUTPUT
       None
