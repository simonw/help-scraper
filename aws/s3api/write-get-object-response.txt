WRITE-GET-OBJECT-RESPONSE()                        WRITE-GET-OBJECT-RESPONSE()



NAME
       write-get-object-response -

DESCRIPTION
       Passes  transformed  objects to a GetObject operation when using Object
       Lambda access  points.  For  information  about  Object  Lambda  access
       points,  see  Transforming  objects with Object Lambda access points in
       the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       This operation supports metadata that can be returned by GetObject , in
       addition  to RequestRoute , RequestToken , StatusCode , ErrorCode , and
       ErrorMessage . The GetObject response metadata is supported so that the
       WriteGetObjectResponse  caller,  typically an Lambda function, can pro-
       vide the same metadata when it  internally  invokes  GetObject  .  When
       WriteGetObjectResponse  is  called by a customer-owned Lambda function,
       the metadata returned to the end user GetObject call might differ  from
       what Amazon S3 would normally return.

       You  can include any number of metadata headers. When including a meta-
       data header, it should be  prefaced  with  x-amz-meta  .  For  example,
       x-amz-meta-my-custom-header:  MyCustomValue  . The primary use case for
       this is to forward GetObject metadata.

       Amazon Web Services provides some prebuilt Lambda  functions  that  you
       can use with S3 Object Lambda to detect and redact personally identifi-
       able information (PII) and decompress S3 objects.  These  Lambda  func-
       tions  are  available in the Amazon Web Services Serverless Application
       Repository, and can be selected through the Amazon Web Services Manage-
       ment Console when you create your Object Lambda access point.

       Example  1:  PII Access Control - This Lambda function uses Amazon Com-
       prehend, a natural language  processing  (NLP)  service  using  machine
       learning  to  find insights and relationships in text. It automatically
       detects personally identifiable information (PII) such  as  names,  ad-
       dresses,  dates,  credit card numbers, and social security numbers from
       documents in your Amazon S3 bucket.

       Example 2: PII Redaction - This Lambda function uses Amazon Comprehend,
       a  natural  language processing (NLP) service using machine learning to
       find insights and relationships in text. It automatically redacts  per-
       sonally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, dates,
       credit card numbers, and social security numbers from documents in your
       Amazon S3 bucket.

       Example 3: Decompression - The Lambda function S3ObjectLambdaDecompres-
       sion, is equipped to decompress objects stored in S3 in one of six com-
       pressed file formats including bzip2, gzip, snappy, zlib, zstandard and
       ZIP.

       For information on how to view and use these functions, see Using  Ama-
       zon Web Services built Lambda functions in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --delete-marker | --no-delete-marker (boolean)
          Specifies whether an object stored in Amazon S3 is (true ) or is not
          (false ) a delete marker.

       --e-tag (string)
          An  opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version
          of a resource found at a URL.

          The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.

       --expiration (string)
          If object stored in Amazon S3  expiration  is  configured  (see  PUT

          SOAP that supports more flexible metadata than the REST API. For ex-
          ample, using SOAP, you can create metadata whose values are not  le-

       the string will be taken literally.
