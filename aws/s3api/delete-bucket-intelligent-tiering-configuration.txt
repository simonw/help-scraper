DELETE-BUCKET-INTELLIGENT-TIEDELETE-BUCKET-INTELLIGENT-TIERING-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       delete-bucket-intelligent-tiering-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  S3  Intelligent-Tiering  configuration from the specified
       bucket.

       The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize  stor-
       age costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective stor-
       age access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. S3
       Intelligent-Tiering  delivers  automatic  cost savings in three low la-
       tency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest storage  cost
       on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to ac-
       tivate additional archiving capabilities.

       The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for
       data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, indepen-
       dent of object size or retention period. If the size of  an  object  is
       less  than  128 KB, it is not monitored and not eligible for auto-tier-
       ing. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at  the
       Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

       For  more  information,  see Storage class for automatically optimizing
       frequently and infrequently accessed objects .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-bucket-intelligent-tiering-configuration
          --bucket <value>
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The  name  of  the  Amazon S3 bucket whose configuration you want to
          modify or retrieve.

       --id (string)
          The ID used to identify the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
