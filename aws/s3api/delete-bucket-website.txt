DELETE-BUCKET-WEBSITE()                                DELETE-BUCKET-WEBSITE()



NAME
       delete-bucket-website -

DESCRIPTION
       This  action  removes the website configuration for a bucket. Amazon S3
       returns a 200 OK response upon successfully deleting a website configu-
       ration  on  the specified bucket. You will get a 200 OK response if the
       website configuration you are trying to delete does not  exist  on  the
       bucket. Amazon S3 returns a 404 response if the bucket specified in the
       request does not exist.

       This DELETE action requires the S3:DeleteBucketWebsite  permission.  By
       default, only the bucket owner can delete the website configuration at-
       tached to a bucket. However, bucket owners can grant other  users  per-
       mission  to delete the website configuration by writing a bucket policy
       granting them the S3:DeleteBucketWebsite permission.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-bucket-website
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The  bucket name for which you want to remove the website configura-
          tion.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP 403 (Ac-
          cess Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
