LIST-PARTS()                                                      LIST-PARTS()



NAME
       list-parts -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  parts  that have been uploaded for a specific multipart up-
       load. This operation must include the upload ID, which  you  obtain  by
       sending     the     initiate     multipart    upload    request    (see
       CreateMultipartUpload ). This request returns a maximum  of  1,000  up-
       loaded  parts. The default number of parts returned is 1,000 parts. You
       can restrict the number of parts returned by specifying  the  max-parts
       request parameter. If your multipart upload consists of more than 1,000
       parts, the response returns an IsTruncated  field  with  the  value  of
       true,  and  a NextPartNumberMarker element. In subsequent ListParts re-
       quests you can include the part-number-marker  query  string  parameter
       and set its value to the NextPartNumberMarker field value from the pre-
       vious response.

       For more information on multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects  Using
       Multipart Upload .

       For  information  on  permissions  required to use the multipart upload
       API, see Multipart Upload and Permissions .

       The following operations are related to ListParts :

       o CreateMultipartUpload

       o UploadPart

       o CompleteMultipartUpload

       o AbortMultipartUpload

       o ListMultipartUploads

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-parts is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: Parts

SYNOPSIS
            list-parts
          --bucket <value>
          --key <value>
          --upload-id <value>
          [--request-payer <value>]
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket to which the parts are being uploaded.

          When  using  this  action  with an access point, you must direct re-
          quests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes
          the  form  AccessPointName -AccountId .s3-accesspoint.*Region* .ama-
          zonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through  the
          Amazon  Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place
          of the bucket name. For more information about  access  point  ARNs,
          see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When  using  this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes  the  form  AccessPointName  -AccountId  .*outpostID* .s3-out-
          posts.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action  using  S3  on
          Outposts  through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Out-
          posts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For  more  information
          about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3
          User Guide .

       --key (string)
          Object key for which the multipart upload was initiated.

       --upload-id (string)
          Upload ID identifying the multipart upload  whose  parts  are  being
          listed.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms  that the requester knows that they will be charged for the
          request. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their  re-
          quests.  For  information  about  downloading objects from requester
          pays buckets, see Downloading Objects in Requestor Pays  Buckets  in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP 403  (Ac-
          cess Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AbortDate -> (timestamp)
          If the bucket has a lifecycle rule  configured  with  an  action  to
          abort  incomplete  multipart uploads and the prefix in the lifecycle
          rule matches the object name in the request, then the  response  in-
          cludes  this  header  indicating when the initiated multipart upload
          will become eligible for abort operation. For more information,  see
          Aborting  Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Pol-
          icy .

          The response will also include the x-amz-abort-rule-id  header  that
          will provide the ID of the lifecycle configuration rule that defines
          this action.

       AbortRuleId -> (string)
          This header is returned along with the x-amz-abort-date  header.  It
          identifies  applicable lifecycle configuration rule that defines the
          action to abort incomplete multipart uploads.

       Bucket -> (string)
          The name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was  initiated.
          Does not return the access point ARN or access point alias if used.

       Key -> (string)
          Object key for which the multipart upload was initiated.

       UploadId -> (string)
          Upload  ID  identifying  the  multipart upload whose parts are being
          listed.

       PartNumberMarker -> (integer)
          When a list is truncated, this element specifies the  last  part  in
          the list, as well as the value to use for the part-number-marker re-
          quest parameter in a subsequent request.

       NextPartNumberMarker -> (integer)
          When a list is truncated, this element specifies the  last  part  in
          the list, as well as the value to use for the part-number-marker re-
          quest parameter in a subsequent request.

       MaxParts -> (integer)
          Maximum number of parts that were allowed in the response.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether the returned list of parts is  truncated.  A  true
          value indicates that the list was truncated. A list can be truncated
          if the number of parts exceeds the limit returned  in  the  MaxParts
          element.

       Parts -> (list)
          Container  for elements related to a particular part. A response can
          contain zero or more Part elements.

          (structure)
              Container for elements related to a part.

              PartNumber -> (integer)
                 Part number identifying the part. This is a positive  integer
                 between 1 and 10,000.

              LastModified -> (timestamp)
                 Date and time at which the part was uploaded.

              ETag -> (string)
                 Entity tag returned when the part was uploaded.

              Size -> (integer)
                 Size in bytes of the uploaded part data.

       Initiator -> (structure)
          Container  element  that  identifies who initiated the multipart up-
          load. If the initiator is an Amazon Web Services account, this  ele-
          ment provides the same information as the Owner element. If the ini-
          tiator is an IAM User, this element provides the user ARN  and  dis-
          play name.

          ID -> (string)
              If  the principal is an Amazon Web Services account, it provides
              the Canonical User ID. If the principal is an IAM User, it  pro-
              vides a user ARN value.

          DisplayName -> (string)
              Name of the Principal.

       Owner -> (structure)
          Container element that identifies the object owner, after the object
          is created. If multipart upload is initiated by an  IAM  user,  this
          element provides the parent account ID and display name.

          DisplayName -> (string)
              Container for the display name of the owner.

          ID -> (string)
              Container for the ID of the owner.

       StorageClass -> (string)
          Class  of storage (STANDARD or REDUCED_REDUNDANCY) used to store the
          uploaded object.

       RequestCharged -> (string)
          If present, indicates that the requester  was  successfully  charged
          for the request.
