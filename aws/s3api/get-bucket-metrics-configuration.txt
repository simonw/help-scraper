NAME
       get-bucket-metrics-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  metrics  configuration (specified by the metrics configuration
       ID) from the bucket. Note that this doesn't include the  daily  storage
       metrics.

       To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3:Get-
       MetricsConfiguration action. The bucket owner has  this  permission  by
       default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more
       information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subre-
       source Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Re-
       sources .

       For information about CloudWatch request metrics  for  Amazon  S3,  see
       Monitoring Metrics with Amazon CloudWatch .

       The following operations are related to GetBucketMetricsConfiguration :

       o PutBucketMetricsConfiguration

       o DeleteBucketMetricsConfiguration

       o ListBucketMetricsConfigurations

       o Monitoring Metrics with Amazon CloudWatch

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-metrics-configuration
          --bucket <value>
          --id <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The  name  of the bucket containing the metrics configuration to re-
          trieve.

       --id (string)
          The ID used to identify the metrics configuration.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP 403 (Ac-
          cess Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve the metrics configuration for a bucket with a specific ID

       The  following  get-bucket-metrics-configuration  example  displays the
       metrics configuration for the specified bucket and ID.

          aws s3api get-bucket-metrics-configuration \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --id 123

       Output:

          {
              "MetricsConfiguration": {
                  "Filter": {
                      "Prefix": "logs"
                  },
                  "Id": "123"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       MetricsConfiguration -> (structure)
          Specifies the metrics configuration.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID used to identify the metrics configuration.

          Filter -> (structure)
              Specifies a metrics configuration filter. The metrics configura-
              tion  will only include objects that meet the filter's criteria.
              A filter must be a prefix, an object tag, an access  point  ARN,
              or a conjunction (MetricsAndOperator).

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The prefix used when evaluating a metrics filter.

              Tag -> (structure)
                 The tag used when evaluating a metrics filter.

                 Key -> (string)
                     Name of the object key.

                 Value -> (string)
                     Value of the tag.

              AccessPointArn -> (string)
                 The access point ARN used when evaluating a metrics filter.

              And -> (structure)
                 A  conjunction  (logical AND) of predicates, which is used in
                 evaluating a metrics filter. The operator must have at  least
                 two  predicates,  and  an object must match all of the predi-
                 cates in order for the filter to apply.

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     The prefix used when evaluating an AND predicate.

                 Tags -> (list)
                     The list of tags used when evaluating an AND predicate.

                     (structure)
                        A container of a key value name pair.

                        Key -> (string)
                            Name of the object key.

                        Value -> (string)
                            Value of the tag.

                 AccessPointArn -> (string)
                     The access point ARN used when evaluating an  AND  predi-
                     cate.
