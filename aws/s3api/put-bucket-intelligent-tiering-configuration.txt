NAME
       put-bucket-intelligent-tiering-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

       Puts  a  S3  Intelligent-Tiering configuration to the specified bucket.
       You can have up to  1,000  S3  Intelligent-Tiering  configurations  per
       bucket.

       The  S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize stor-
       age costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective stor-
       age access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. S3
       Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic cost savings in  three  low  la-
       tency  and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest storage cost
       on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to ac-
       tivate additional archiving capabilities.

       The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for
       data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, indepen-
       dent  of  object  size or retention period. If the size of an object is
       less than 128 KB, it is not monitored and not eligible  for  auto-tier-
       ing.  Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at the
       Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

       For more information, see Storage class  for  automatically  optimizing
       frequently and infrequently accessed objects .

       Operations related to PutBucketIntelligentTieringConfiguration include:

       o DeleteBucketIntelligentTieringConfiguration

       o GetBucketIntelligentTieringConfiguration

       o ListBucketIntelligentTieringConfigurations

       NOTE:
              You  only need S3 Intelligent-Tiering enabled on a bucket if you
              want to automatically move objects stored  in  the  S3  Intelli-
              gent-Tiering storage class to the Archive Access or Deep Archive
              Access tier.

          PutBucketIntelligentTieringConfiguration has the  following  special
          errors:
              HTTP 400 Bad Request Error

          Code: InvalidArgument

          Cause: Invalid Argument
              HTTP 400 Bad Request Error

          Code: TooManyConfigurations

          Cause: You are attempting to create a new configuration but have al-
          ready reached the 1,000-configuration limit.
              HTTP 403 Forbidden Error

          Cause: You are not the owner of the specified bucket, or you do  not
          have  the s3:PutIntelligentTieringConfiguration bucket permission to
          set the configuration on the bucket.

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)

          modify or retrieve.

              Prefix -> (string)
                 An  object  key name prefix that identifies the subset of ob-
                 jects to which the rule applies.

                 WARNING:
                     Replacement must be made for object keys containing  spe-
                     cial characters (such as carriage returns) when using XML
                     requests. For more information, see  XML  related  object
                     key constraints .

              Tag -> (structure)

                 cates in order for the filter to apply.

              configuration.

              (structure)
                 The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to opti-
                 mize storage costs by automatically moving data to  the  most
                 cost-effective storage access tier, without additional opera-

                     responding tier. The minimum number of days specified for
                     Archive Access tier must be at least 90 days and Deep Ar-
                     chive Access tier must be at least 180 days. The  maximum

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI

       To update an S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration on a bucket

       The  following put-bucket-intelligent-tiering-configuration example up-
       dates an S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration, named ExampleConfig,  on
       a  bucket. The configuration will transition objects that have not been
       accessed under the prefix images to Archive Access after  90  days  and
       Deep Archive Access after 180 days.

          aws s3api put-bucket-intelligent-tiering-configuration \
              --bucket DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET \
              --id "ExampleConfig" \
              --intelligent-tiering-configuration file://intelligent-tiering-configuration.json

       Contents of intelligent-tiering-configuration.json:

          {
              "Id": "ExampleConfig",
              "Status": "Enabled",
              "Filter": {
                  "Prefix": "images"
                  },
              "Tierings": [
                  {
                      "Days": 90,
                      "AccessTier": "ARCHIVE_ACCESS"
                  },
                  {
                      "Days": 180,
                      "AccessTier": "DEEP_ARCHIVE_ACCESS"
                  }
              ]
          }

       This command produces no output.

       bucket in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
