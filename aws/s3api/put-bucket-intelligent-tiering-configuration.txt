PUT-BUCKET-INTELLIGENT-TIERING-CPUT-BUCKET-INTELLIGENT-TIERING-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       put-bucket-intelligent-tiering-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Puts  a  S3  Intelligent-Tiering configuration to the specified bucket.
       You can have up to  1,000  S3  Intelligent-Tiering  configurations  per
       bucket.

       The  S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize stor-
       age costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective stor-
       age access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. S3
       Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic cost savings in  three  low  la-
       tency  and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest storage cost
       on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to ac-
       tivate additional archiving capabilities.

       The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for
       data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, indepen-
       dent  of  object  size or retention period. If the size of an object is
       less than 128 KB, it is not monitored and not eligible  for  auto-tier-
       ing.  Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at the
       Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

       For more information, see Storage class  for  automatically  optimizing
       frequently and infrequently accessed objects .

       NOTE:
              You  only need S3 Intelligent-Tiering enabled on a bucket if you
              want to automatically move objects stored  in  the  S3  Intelli-
              gent-Tiering storage class to the Archive Access or Deep Archive
              Access tier.

          Special Errors

       o HTTP 400 Bad Request Error

         o Cause: Invalid Argument

       o HTTP 400 Bad Request Error

         o Code: TooManyConfigurations

         o Cause: You are attempting to create a new  configuration  but  have
           already reached the 1,000-configuration limit.

       o HTTP 403 Forbidden Error

         o Code: AccessDenied

         o Cause: You are not the owner of the specified bucket, or you do not

SYNOPSIS
            put-bucket-intelligent-tiering-configuration
          --bucket <value>
          --id <value>
          --intelligent-tiering-configuration <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The  name  of  the  Amazon S3 bucket whose configuration you want to
          modify or retrieve.

       --id (string)
          The ID used to identify the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration.

       --intelligent-tiering-configuration (structure)
          Container for S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID used to identify the  S3  Intelligent-Tiering  configura-
              tion.

          Filter -> (structure)
              Specifies  a  bucket filter. The configuration only includes ob-
              jects that meet the filter's criteria.

              Prefix -> (string)
                 An object key name prefix that identifies the subset  of  ob-
                 jects to which the rule applies.

                 WARNING:
                     Replacement  must be made for object keys containing spe-
                     cial characters (such as carriage returns) when using XML
                     requests.  For  more  information, see XML related object
                     key constraints .

              Tag -> (structure)
                 A container of a key value name pair.

                 Key -> (string)
                     Name of the object key.

                 Value -> (string)
                     Value of the tag.

              And -> (structure)
                 A conjunction (logical AND) of predicates, which is  used  in
                 evaluating  a metrics filter. The operator must have at least
                 two predicates, and an object must match all  of  the  predi-
                 cates in order for the filter to apply.

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     An  object  key name prefix that identifies the subset of
                     objects to which the configuration applies.

                 Tags -> (list)
                     All of these tags must exist in the object's tag  set  in
                     order for the configuration to apply.

                     (structure)
                        A container of a key value name pair.

                        Key -> (string)

              Specifies the status of the configuration.

          Tierings -> (list)
              Specifies  the  S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class tier of the
              configuration.

              (structure)
                 The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to opti-
                 mize  storage  costs by automatically moving data to the most
                 cost-effective storage access tier, without additional opera-
                 tional overhead.

                 Days -> (integer)
                     The  number  of consecutive days of no access after which
                     an object will be eligible to be transitioned to the cor-
                     responding tier. The minimum number of days specified for
                     Archive Access tier must be at least 90 days and Deep Ar-
                     chive  Access tier must be at least 180 days. The maximum
                     can be up to 2 years (730 days).

                 AccessTier -> (string)
                     S3 Intelligent-Tiering access tier. See Storage class for
                     automatically  optimizing frequently and infrequently ac-
                     cessed objects for a list of access tiers in the  S3  In-
                     telligent-Tiering storage class.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
