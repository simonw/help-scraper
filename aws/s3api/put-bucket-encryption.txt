PUT-BUCKET-ENCRYPTION()                                PUT-BUCKET-ENCRYPTION()



NAME
       put-bucket-encryption -

DESCRIPTION
       This  action  uses  the encryption subresource to configure default en-
       cryption and Amazon S3 Bucket Key for an existing bucket.

       Default encryption for a bucket can  use  server-side  encryption  with
       Amazon  S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or customer managed keys (SSE-KMS). If
       you specify default encryption using SSE-KMS, you  can  also  configure
       Amazon  S3  Bucket  Key.  For information about default encryption, see
       Amazon S3 default bucket encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide  .  For
       more information about S3 Bucket Keys, see Amazon S3 Bucket Keys in the
       Amazon S3 User Guide .

       WARNING:
          This action requires Amazon Web Services Signature  Version  4.  For
          more  information,  see Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services
          Signature Version 4) .

       To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the  s3:Pu-
       tEncryptionConfiguration  action.  The bucket owner has this permission
       by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to  others.  For
       more  information  about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket
       Subresource Operations and Managing Access Permissions to  Your  Amazon
       S3 Resources in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

SYNOPSIS
            put-bucket-encryption
          --bucket <value>
          [--content-md5 <value>]
          --server-side-encryption-configuration <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          Specifies  default encryption for a bucket using server-side encryp-
          tion with Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or customer  managed  keys
          (SSE-KMS).  For  information  about the Amazon S3 default encryption
          feature, see Amazon S3 Default Bucket Encryption in  the  Amazon  S3
          User Guide .

       --content-md5 (string)
          The  base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the server-side encryption
          configuration.

          For requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line  Inter-
          face (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated au-
          tomatically.

       --server-side-encryption-configuration (structure)
          Specifies the default server-side-encryption configuration.

          Rules -> (list)
              Container for information about a particular server-side encryp-
              tion configuration rule.

              (structure)
                 Specifies the default server-side encryption configuration.

                 ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault -> (structure)
                     Specifies  the default server-side encryption to apply to
                     new objects in  the  bucket.  If  a  PUT  Object  request
                     doesn't  specify any server-side encryption, this default
                     encryption will be applied.

                     SSEAlgorithm -> (string)
                        Server-side encryption algorithm to use  for  the  de-
                        fault encryption.

                     KMSMasterKeyID -> (string)
                        Amazon  Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) cus-
                        tomer Amazon Web Services KMS key ID to  use  for  the
                        default  encryption.  This parameter is allowed if and
                        only if SSEAlgorithm is set to aws:kms .

                        You can specify the key ID or the Amazon Resource Name
                        (ARN)  of  the  KMS key. However, if you are using en-
                        cryption with cross-account  or  Amazon  Web  Services
                        service  operations you must use a fully qualified KMS
                        key ARN. For more information,  see  Using  encryption
                        for cross-account operations .
                            For example:

                        o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

                        o Key                                             ARN:
                          arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

                        WARNING:
                            Amazon S3 only supports symmetric KMS keys and not
                            asymmetric KMS keys.  For  more  information,  see
                            Using  symmetric and asymmetric keys in the Amazon
                            Web  Services  Key  Management  Service  Developer
                            Guide .

                 BucketKeyEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key
                     with server-side encryption using KMS (SSE-KMS)  for  new
                     objects in the bucket. Existing objects are not affected.
                     Setting the BucketKeyEnabled element to true causes  Ama-
                     zon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key. By default, S3 Bucket Key
                     is not enabled.

                     For more information, see Amazon S3 Bucket  Keys  in  the
                     Amazon S3 User Guide .

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Rules": [
              {
                "ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault": {
                  "SSEAlgorithm": "AES256"|"aws:kms",
                  "KMSMasterKeyID": "string"
                },
                "BucketKeyEnabled": true|false
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP 403  (Ac-
          cess Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To configure server-side encryption for a bucket

       The following put-bucket-encryption example sets AES256  encryption  as
       the default for the specified bucket.

          aws s3api put-bucket-encryption \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --server-side-encryption-configuration '{"Rules": [{"ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault": {"SSEAlgorithm": "AES256"}}]}'

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
