LIST-MULTIPART-UPLOADS()                              LIST-MULTIPART-UPLOADS()



NAME
       list-multipart-uploads -

DESCRIPTION
       This  action lists in-progress multipart uploads. An in-progress multi-
       part upload is a multipart upload that has  been  initiated  using  the
       Initiate  Multipart  Upload  request, but has not yet been completed or
       aborted.

       This action returns at most 1,000 multipart uploads  in  the  response.
       1,000 multipart uploads is the maximum number of uploads a response can
       include, which is also the default value. You  can  further  limit  the
       number of uploads in a response by specifying the max-uploads parameter
       in the response. If additional multipart uploads satisfy the list  cri-
       teria,  the response will contain an IsTruncated element with the value
       true. To list the additional multipart uploads, use the key-marker  and
       upload-id-marker request parameters.

       In the response, the uploads are sorted by key. If your application has
       initiated more than one multipart upload using  the  same  object  key,
       then uploads in the response are first sorted by key. Additionally, up-
       loads are sorted in ascending order within each key by the upload  ini-
       tiation time.

       For  more information on multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects Using
       Multipart Upload .

       For information on permissions required to  use  the  multipart  upload
       API, see Multipart Upload and Permissions .

       list-multipart-uploads is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Uploads, CommonPrefixes

SYNOPSIS
            list-multipart-uploads
          --bucket <value>
          [--delimiter <value>]
          [--encoding-type <value>]
          [--prefix <value>]
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated.

          When using this action with an access point,  you  must  direct  re-
          quests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes
          the form AccessPointName -AccountId  .s3-accesspoint.*Region*  .ama-
          zonaws.com.  When using this action with an access point through the
          Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in  place
          of  the  bucket  name. For more information about access point ARNs,
          see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you  must  direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes the  form  AccessPointName  -AccountId  .*outpostID*  .s3-out-
          posts.*Region*  .amazonaws.com.  When  using this action using S3 on
          Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the  Out-
          posts  bucket  ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information
          about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3
          User Guide .

       --delimiter (string)
          Character you use to group keys.

          All  keys that contain the same string between the prefix, if speci-
          fied, and the first occurrence of the delimiter after the prefix are
          grouped under a single result element, CommonPrefixes . If you don't
          specify the prefix parameter, then the substring starts at  the  be-
          ginning  of  the key. The keys that are grouped under CommonPrefixes
          result element are not returned elsewhere in the response.

       --encoding-type (string)
          Requests Amazon S3 to encode the object keys  in  the  response  and
          specifies  the encoding method to use. An object key may contain any
          Unicode character; however, XML 1.0 parser cannot parse some charac-
          ters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For char-
          acters that are not supported in XML 1.0, you can add this parameter
          to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response.

          Possible values:

          o url

       --prefix (string)
          Lists  in-progress  uploads  only for those keys that begin with the
          specified prefix. You can use prefixes to  separate  a  bucket  into
          different  grouping  of keys. (You can think of using prefix to make
          groups in the same way you'd use a folder in a file system.)

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP 403 (Ac-
          cess Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       In  progress  multipart  uploads incur storage costs in Amazon S3. Com-
       plete or abort an active multipart upload to remove its parts from your
       account.

OUTPUT
       Bucket -> (string)
          The  name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated.
          Does not return the access point ARN or access point alias if used.

       KeyMarker -> (string)
          The key at or after which the listing began.

       UploadIdMarker -> (string)
          Upload ID after which listing began.

       NextKeyMarker -> (string)
          When a list is truncated, this  element  specifies  the  value  that
          should  be used for the key-marker request parameter in a subsequent
          request.

       Prefix -> (string)
          When a prefix is provided in the request, this  field  contains  the
          specified  prefix.  The  result contains only keys starting with the
          specified prefix.

       Delimiter -> (string)
          Contains the delimiter you specified in the request.  If  you  don't
          specify a delimiter in your request, this element is absent from the
          response.

       NextUploadIdMarker -> (string)
          When a list is truncated, this  element  specifies  the  value  that
          should  be used for the upload-id-marker request parameter in a sub-
          sequent request.

       MaxUploads -> (integer)
          Maximum number of multipart uploads that could have been included in
          the response.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  the  returned list of multipart uploads is trun-
          cated. A value of true indicates that the list  was  truncated.  The
          list can be truncated if the number of multipart uploads exceeds the
          limit allowed or specified by max uploads.

       Uploads -> (list)
          Container for elements related to a particular multipart  upload.  A
          response can contain zero or more Upload elements.

          (structure)
              Container for the MultipartUpload for the Amazon S3 object.

              UploadId -> (string)
                 Upload ID that identifies the multipart upload.

              Key -> (string)
                 Key  of  the object for which the multipart upload was initi-
                 ated.

              Initiated -> (timestamp)
                 Date and time at which the multipart upload was initiated.

              StorageClass -> (string)
                 The class of storage used to store the object.

              Owner -> (structure)
                 Specifies the owner of the object that is part of the  multi-
                 part upload.

                 DisplayName -> (string)
                     Container for the display name of the owner.

                 ID -> (string)
                     Container for the ID of the owner.

              Initiator -> (structure)
                 Identifies who initiated the multipart upload.

                 ID -> (string)
                     If  the  principal  is an Amazon Web Services account, it
                     provides the Canonical User ID. If the  principal  is  an
                     IAM User, it provides a user ARN value.

                 DisplayName -> (string)
                     Name of the Principal.

       CommonPrefixes -> (list)
          If  you  specify a delimiter in the request, then the result returns
          each distinct key prefix containing the delimiter  in  a  CommonPre-
          fixes  element. The distinct key prefixes are returned in the Prefix
          child element.

          (structure)
              Container for all (if there are any) keys between Prefix and the
              next  occurrence of the string specified by a delimiter. Common-
              Prefixes lists keys that act like subdirectories in  the  direc-
              tory  specified  by Prefix. For example, if the prefix is notes/
              and the delimiter is a slash (/) as  in  notes/summer/july,  the
              common prefix is notes/summer/.

              Prefix -> (string)
                 Container for the specified common prefix.

       EncodingType -> (string)
          Encoding  type  used  by  Amazon S3 to encode object keys in the re-
          sponse.

          If you specify encoding-type request parameter, Amazon  S3  includes
          this element in the response, and returns encoded key name values in
          the following response elements:
              Delimiter , KeyMarker , Prefix , NextKeyMarker , Key .
