DELETE-OBJECTS()                                              DELETE-OBJECTS()



NAME
       delete-objects -

DESCRIPTION
       This  action enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using
       a single HTTP request. If you know the object keys  that  you  want  to
       delete, then this action provides a suitable alternative to sending in-
       dividual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead.

       The request contains a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete.
       In  the  XML, you provide the object key names, and optionally, version
       IDs if you want to delete a specific version of the object from a  ver-
       sioning-enabled  bucket.  For each key, Amazon S3 performs a delete ac-
       tion and returns the result of that delete, success, or failure, in the
       response.  Note  that  if  the  object  specified in the request is not
       found, Amazon S3 returns the result as deleted.

       The action supports two modes for the response: verbose and  quiet.  By
       default,  the  action  uses verbose mode in which the response includes
       the result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet  mode  the
       response  includes only keys where the delete action encountered an er-
       ror. For a successful deletion, the action does not return any informa-
       tion about the delete in the response body.

       When  performing  this action on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that at-
       tempts to delete any versioned objects, you must include an MFA  token.
       If  you do not provide one, the entire request will fail, even if there
       are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you  provide  an
       invalid  token, whether there are versioned keys in the request or not,
       the entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about
       MFA Delete, see MFA Delete .

       Finally, the Content-MD5 header is required for all Multi-Object Delete
       requests. Amazon S3 uses the header value to ensure that  your  request
       body has not been altered in transit.

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name containing the objects to delete.

          When  using  this  action  with an access point, you must direct re-
          quests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes
          the  form  AccessPointName -AccountId .s3-accesspoint.*Region* .ama-
          zonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through  the
          Amazon  Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place
          of the bucket name. For more information about  access  point  ARNs,
          see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes  the  form `` AccessPointName -AccountId .*outpostID* .s3-out-
          posts.*Region* .amazonaws.com`` . When you use this action  with  S3
          on  Outposts  through  the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the
          Outposts access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more  in-
          formation  about  S3 on Outposts ARNs, see What is S3 on Outposts in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                     delete.

          Quiet -> (boolean)
              Element to enable quiet mode for the request. When you add  this
              element, you must set its value to true.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Objects=[{Key=string,VersionId=string},{Key=string,VersionId=string}],Quiet=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Objects": [
              {
                "Key": "string",
                "VersionId": "string"
              }
              ...
            ],
            "Quiet": true|false
          }

       --mfa (string)
          The  concatenation  of  the authentication device's serial number, a
          space, and the value that is displayed on  your  authentication  de-
          vice.  Required to permanently delete a versioned object if version-
          ing is configured with MFA delete enabled.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for  the
          request.  Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their re-
          quests. For information about  downloading  objects  from  Requester
          Pays  buckets,  see Downloading Objects in Requester Pays Buckets in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --bypass-governance-retention | --no-bypass-governance-retention (bool-
       ean)
          Specifies  whether  you  want to delete this object even if it has a
          Governance-type Object Lock in place. To use this header,  you  must
          have the s3:BypassGovernanceRetention permission.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status  code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --checksum-algorithm (string)
          Indicates  the  algorithm used to create the checksum for the object
          when using the SDK. This header  will  not  provide  any  additional
          functionality  if not using the SDK. When sending this header, there
          must be a corresponding x-amz-checksum or x-amz-trailer header sent.
          Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code 400
          Bad Request . For more information, see Checking object integrity in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          If  you  provide  an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any pro-
          vided ChecksumAlgorithm parameter.

          This checksum algorithm must be the same for all parts and it  match
          the checksum value supplied in the CreateMultipartUpload request.

          Possible values:

          o CRC32

          o CRC32C

          o SHA1

          o SHA256

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command deletes an object from a bucket named my-bucket:

          aws s3api delete-objects --bucket my-bucket --delete file://delete.json

       delete.json  is a JSON document in the current directory that specifies
       the object to delete:

          {
            "Objects": [
              {
                "Key": "test1.txt"
              }
            ],
            "Quiet": false
          }

       Output:

          {
              "Deleted": [
                  {
                      "DeleteMarkerVersionId": "mYAT5Mc6F7aeUL8SS7FAAqUPO1koHwzU",
                      "Key": "test1.txt",
                      "DeleteMarker": true
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Deleted -> (list)
          Container element for a successful delete. It identifies the  object
          that was successfully deleted.

          (structure)
              Information about the deleted object.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the deleted object.

              VersionId -> (string)
                 The version ID of the deleted object.

              DeleteMarker -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  the versioned object that was permanently
                 deleted was (true) or was not (false) a delete marker.  In  a
                 simple  DELETE,  this  header indicates whether (true) or not
                 (false) a delete marker was created.

              DeleteMarkerVersionId -> (string)
                 The version ID of the delete marker created as  a  result  of
                 the  DELETE  operation.  If you delete a specific object ver-
                 sion, the value returned by this header is the version ID  of
                 the object version deleted.

       RequestCharged -> (string)
          If  present,  indicates  that the requester was successfully charged
          for the request.

       Errors -> (list)
          Container for a failed delete action that describes the object  that
          Amazon S3 attempted to delete and the error it encountered.

          (structure)
              Container for all error elements.

              Key -> (string)
                 The error key.

              VersionId -> (string)
                 The version ID of the error.

              Code -> (string)
                 The  error code is a string that uniquely identifies an error
                 condition. It is meant to be read and understood by  programs
                 that  detect  and  handle  errors by type. The following is a
                 list of Amazon S3 error  codes.  For  more  information,  see
                 Error responses .

              Message -> (string)
                 The error message contains a generic description of the error
                 condition in English. It is intended for  a  human  audience.
                 Simple  programs display the message directly to the end user
                 if they encounter an error condition they don't know  how  or
                 don't  care  to  handle. Sophisticated programs with more ex-
                 haustive error handling and proper  internationalization  are
                 more likely to ignore the error message.
