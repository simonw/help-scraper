PUT-BUCKET-LOGGING()                                      PUT-BUCKET-LOGGING()



NAME
       put-bucket-logging -

DESCRIPTION
       Set  the logging parameters for a bucket and to specify permissions for
       who can view and modify the logging parameters. All logs are  saved  to
       buckets in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the source bucket. To
       set the logging status of a bucket, you must be the bucket owner.

       The bucket owner is automatically granted FULL_CONTROL to all logs. You
       use  the  Grantee  request element to grant access to other people. The
       Permissions request element specifies the kind of  access  the  grantee
       has to the logs.

       WARNING:
              If  the target bucket for log delivery uses the bucket owner en-
              forced setting for  S3  Object  Ownership,  you  can't  use  the
              Grantee  request  element to grant access to others. Permissions
              can only be granted using policies. For  more  information,  see
              Permissions for server access log delivery in the Amazon S3 User
              Guide .

          Grantee Values

       You can specify the person (grantee) to whom  you're  assigning  access
       rights (using request elements) in the following ways:

       o By           the           person's           ID:            <Grantee
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesE-
         mail<></DisplayName> </Grantee>   DisplayName is optional and ignored
         in the request.

       o By               Email               address:                <Grantee
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"  xsi:type="Ama-
         zonCustomerByEmail"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAd-
         dress></Grantee>   The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser  and,
         in  a  response  to  a GET Object acl request, appears as the Canoni-
         calUser.

       o By  URI:   <Grantee   xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-in-
         stance"                    xsi:type="Group"><URI><>http://acs.amazon-
         aws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>

       To enable logging, you use LoggingEnabled and its children request ele-
       ments. To disable logging, you use an empty BucketLoggingStatus request
       element:
          <BucketLoggingStatus  xmlns="http://doc.s3.amazonaws.com/2006-03-01"
          />

       Logging in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       For more information about creating a bucket, see  CreateBucket  .  For
       more  information  about  returning the logging status of a bucket, see

SYNOPSIS
            put-bucket-logging
          --bucket <value>
          --bucket-logging-status <value>
          [--content-md5 <value>]
          [--checksum-algorithm <value>]
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket for which to set the logging parameters.

       --bucket-logging-status (structure)
          Container for logging status information.

          LoggingEnabled -> (structure)
              Describes where logs are stored and the prefix  that  Amazon  S3
              assigns  to  all log object keys for a bucket. For more informa-
              tion, see PUT Bucket logging in the Amazon S3 API Reference .

              TargetBucket -> (string)
                 Specifies the bucket where you want Amazon S3 to store server
                 access  logs.  You can have your logs delivered to any bucket
                 that you own, including the same bucket that is being logged.
                 You can also configure multiple buckets to deliver their logs
                 to the same target bucket. In this case, you should choose  a
                 different TargetPrefix for each source bucket so that the de-
                 livered log files can be distinguished by key.

              TargetGrants -> (list)
                 Container for granting information.

                 Buckets that use the bucket owner enforced setting for Object
                 Ownership  don't support target grants. For more information,
                 see Permissions for server access log delivery in the  Amazon
                 S3 User Guide .

                 (structure)
                     Container for granting information.

                     Buckets  that  use  the bucket owner enforced setting for
                     Object Ownership don't support target  grants.  For  more
                     information,  see  Permissions server access log delivery
                     in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                     Grantee -> (structure)

                            Screen name of the grantee.

                        EmailAddress -> (string)
                            Email address of the grantee.

                            NOTE:
                               Using email addresses to specify a  grantee  is
                               only supported in the following Amazon Web Ser-
                               vices Regions:

                               For a list of all the Amazon S3  supported  Re-
                               gions  and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints
                               in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

                        ID -> (string)

                        Type -> (string)
                            Type of grantee

                        URI -> (string)
                            URI of the grantee group.

                     Permission -> (string)
                        Logging permissions assigned to the  grantee  for  the
                        bucket.

              TargetPrefix -> (string)
                 A prefix for all log object keys. If you store log files from
                 multiple Amazon S3 buckets in a single bucket, you can use  a
                 prefix to distinguish which log files came from which bucket.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "LoggingEnabled": {
              "TargetBucket": "string",
              "TargetGrants": [
                {
                  "Grantee": {
                    "DisplayName": "string",
                    "EmailAddress": "string",
                    "ID": "string",
                    "Type": "CanonicalUser"|"AmazonCustomerByEmail"|"Group",
                    "URI": "string"
                  },
                  "Permission": "FULL_CONTROL"|"READ"|"WRITE"
                }
                ...
              ],
              "TargetPrefix": "string"
            }
          }

       --content-md5 (string)
          The MD5 hash of the PutBucketLogging request body.

          For  requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line Inter-
          face (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated au-
          tomatically.

       --checksum-algorithm (string)
          Indicates  the  algorithm used to create the checksum for the object
          when using the SDK. This header  will  not  provide  any  additional
          functionality  if not using the SDK. When sending this header, there
          must be a corresponding x-amz-checksum or x-amz-trailer header sent.
          Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code 400
          Bad Request . For more information, see Checking object integrity in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          If  you  provide  an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any pro-
          vided ChecksumAlgorithm parameter.

          Possible values:

          o CRC32

          o CRC32C

          o SHA1

          o SHA256

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To set bucket policy logging

       The  following  put-bucket-logging  example sets the logging policy for
       MyBucket. First, grant the logging service principal permission in your
       bucket policy using the put-bucket-policy command.

          aws s3api put-bucket-policy \
              --bucket MyBucket \
              --policy file://policy.json

       Contents of policy.json:

          {
              "Version": "2012-10-17",
              "Statement": [
                  {
                      "Sid": "S3ServerAccessLogsPolicy",
                      "Effect": "Allow",
                      "Principal": {"Service": "logging.s3.amazonaws.com"},
                      "Action": "s3:PutObject",
                      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::MyBucket/Logs/*",
                      "Condition": {
                          "ArnLike": {"aws:SourceARN": "arn:aws:s3:::SOURCE-BUCKET-NAME"},
                          "StringEquals": {"aws:SourceAccount": "SOURCE-AWS-ACCOUNT-ID"}
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

       To apply the logging policy, use put-bucket-logging.

          aws s3api put-bucket-logging \
              --bucket MyBucket \
              --bucket-logging-status file://logging.json

       Contents of logging.json:

          {
               "LoggingEnabled": {
                   "TargetBucket": "MyBucket",
                   "TargetPrefix": "Logs/"
               }
           }

       NOTE:
          The put-bucket-policy command is required to grant s3:PutObject per-
          missions to the logging service principal.

       For more information, see Amazon S3 Server Access Logging in the Amazon
       S3 User Guide.

       Example  2:  To set a bucket policy for logging access to only a single
       user

       The following put-bucket-logging example sets the  logging  policy  for
       MyBucket.  The AWS user bob@example.com will have full control over the
       log files, and no one else has any access. First, grant  S3  permission
       with put-bucket-acl.

          aws s3api put-bucket-acl \
              --bucket MyBucket \
              --grant-write URI=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery \
              --grant-read-acp URI=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery

       Then apply the logging policy using put-bucket-logging.

          aws s3api put-bucket-logging \
              --bucket MyBucket \
              --bucket-logging-status file://logging.json

       Contents of logging.json:

          {
              "LoggingEnabled": {
                  "TargetBucket": "MyBucket",
                  "TargetPrefix": "MyBucketLogs/",
                  "TargetGrants": [
                      {
                          "Grantee": {
                              "Type": "AmazonCustomerByEmail",
                              "EmailAddress": "bob@example.com"
                          },
                          "Permission": "FULL_CONTROL"
                      }
                  ]
              }
          }

       NOTE:
          the  put-bucket-acl  command  is required to grant S3's log delivery
          system the necessary permissions (write and read-acp permissions).

       For more information, see Amazon S3 Server Access Logging in the Amazon
       S3 Developer Guide.
