GET-BUCKET-CORS()                                            GET-BUCKET-CORS()



NAME
       get-bucket-cors -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the cors configuration information set for the bucket.

       To  use this operation, you must have permission to perform the s3:Get-
       BucketCORS action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and
       can grant it to others.

       For  more  information  about  cors, see Enabling Cross-Origin Resource
       Sharing .

       The following operations are related to GetBucketCors :

       o PutBucketCors

       o DeleteBucketCors

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-cors
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name for which to get the cors configuration.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP 403 (Ac-
          cess Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command retrieves the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing  con-
       figuration for a bucket named my-bucket:

          aws s3api get-bucket-cors --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

OUTPUT
       CORSRules -> (list)
          A  set  of origins and methods (cross-origin access that you want to
          allow). You can add up to 100 rules to the configuration.

          (structure)
              Specifies a cross-origin access rule for an Amazon S3 bucket.

              ID -> (string)
                 Unique identifier for the rule. The value  cannot  be  longer
                 than 255 characters.

              AllowedHeaders -> (list)
                 Headers   that   are   specified  in  the  Access-Control-Re-
                 quest-Headers header. These headers are  allowed  in  a  pre-
                 flight  OPTIONS request. In response to any preflight OPTIONS
                 request, Amazon S3 returns any requested headers that are al-
                 lowed.

                 (string)

              AllowedMethods -> (list)
                 An  HTTP  method  that you allow the origin to execute. Valid
                 values are GET , PUT , HEAD , POST , and DELETE .

                 (string)

              AllowedOrigins -> (list)
                 One or more origins you want customers to be able  to  access
                 the bucket from.

                 (string)

              ExposeHeaders -> (list)
                 One  or  more headers in the response that you want customers
                 to be able to access from their  applications  (for  example,
                 from a JavaScript XMLHttpRequest object).

                 (string)

              MaxAgeSeconds -> (integer)
                 The  time  in  seconds that your browser is to cache the pre-
                 flight response for the specified resource.
