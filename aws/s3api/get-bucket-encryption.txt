GET-BUCKET-ENCRYPTION()                                GET-BUCKET-ENCRYPTION()



NAME
       get-bucket-encryption -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  default encryption configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket.
       If the bucket does not have a default  encryption  configuration,  Get-
       BucketEncryption returns ServerSideEncryptionConfigurationNotFoundError
       .

       For information about the Amazon S3  default  encryption  feature,  see
       Amazon S3 Default Bucket Encryption .

       To  use  this operation, you must have permission to perform the s3:Ge-
       tEncryptionConfiguration action. The bucket owner has  this  permission
       by  default.  The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For
       more information about permissions, see Permissions Related  to  Bucket
       Subresource  Operations  and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon
       S3 Resources .

       The following operations are related to GetBucketEncryption :

       o PutBucketEncryption

       o DeleteBucketEncryption

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-encryption
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket from which the server-side encryption config-
          uration is retrieved.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status  code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve the server-side encryption configuration for a bucket

       The following get-bucket-encryption example retrieves  the  server-side
       encryption configuration for the bucket my-bucket.

          aws s3api get-bucket-encryption \
              --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration": {
                  "Rules": [
                      {
                          "ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault": {
                              "SSEAlgorithm": "AES256"
                          }
                      }
                  ]
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
          Specifies the default server-side-encryption configuration.

          Rules -> (list)
              Container for information about a particular server-side encryp-
              tion configuration rule.

              (structure)
                 Specifies the default server-side encryption configuration.

                 ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault -> (structure)
                     Specifies the default server-side encryption to apply  to
                     new  objects  in  the  bucket.  If  a  PUT Object request
                     doesn't specify any server-side encryption, this  default
                     encryption will be applied.

                     SSEAlgorithm -> (string)
                        Server-side  encryption  algorithm  to use for the de-
                        fault encryption.

                     KMSMasterKeyID -> (string)
                        Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS)  cus-
                        tomer  Amazon  Web  Services KMS key ID to use for the
                        default encryption. This parameter is allowed  if  and
                        only if SSEAlgorithm is set to aws:kms .

                        You can specify the key ID or the Amazon Resource Name
                        (ARN) of the KMS key. However, if you  are  using  en-
                        cryption  with  cross-account  or  Amazon Web Services
                        service operations you must use a fully qualified  KMS
                        key  ARN.  For  more information, see Using encryption
                        for cross-account operations .
                            For example:

                        o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

                        o Key                                             ARN:
                          arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

                        WARNING:
                            Amazon S3 only supports symmetric KMS keys and not
                            asymmetric  KMS  keys.  For  more information, see
                            Using symmetric and asymmetric keys in the  Amazon
                            Web  Services  Key  Management  Service  Developer
                            Guide .

                 BucketKeyEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3  Bucket  Key
                     with  server-side  encryption using KMS (SSE-KMS) for new
                     objects in the bucket. Existing objects are not affected.
                     Setting  the BucketKeyEnabled element to true causes Ama-
                     zon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key. By default, S3 Bucket Key
                     is not enabled.

                     Amazon S3 User Guide .
