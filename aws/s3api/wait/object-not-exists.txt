NAME
       object-not-exists -

DESCRIPTION
       Wait  until  404 response is received when polling with head-object. It
       will poll every 5 seconds until a successful state  has  been  reached.
       This will exit with a return code of 255 after 20 failed checks.

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket containing the object.

          When  using  this  action  with an access point, you must direct re-
          quests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes
          the  form  AccessPointName -AccountId .s3-accesspoint.*Region* .ama-
          zonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through  the
          Amazon  Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place
          of the bucket name. For more information about  access  point  ARNs,
          see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When  using  this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes  the  form  AccessPointName  -AccountId  .*outpostID* .s3-out-
          posts.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action  using  S3  on
          Outposts  through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Out-
          posts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For  more  information
          about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3
          User Guide .

       --if-match (string)
          Return the object only if its entity tag (ETag) is the same  as  the
          one specified, otherwise return a 412 (precondition failed).

       --if-modified-since (timestamp)
          Return  the  object only if it has been modified since the specified
          time, otherwise return a 304 (not modified).

       --if-none-match (string)
          Return the object only if its entity tag (ETag)  is  different  from
          the one specified, otherwise return a 304 (not modified).

       --if-unmodified-since (timestamp)
          Return  the object only if it has not been modified since the speci-
          fied time, otherwise return a 412 (precondition failed).

       --key (string)
          The object key.

       --range (string)
          Because HeadObject returns only the metadata for an object, this pa-
          rameter has no effect.

       --version-id (string)
          VersionId used to reference a specific version of the object.

       --sse-customer-algorithm (string)
          Specifies  the  algorithm  to use to when encrypting the object (for
          example, AES256).

       --sse-customer-key (string)
          Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to  use
          in  encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then
          it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the  encryption  key.  The
          key  must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
          x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm header.

       --sse-customer-key-md5 (string)
          Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according  to
          RFC  1321.  Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check
          to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for  the
          request.  Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their re-
          quests. For information about  downloading  objects  from  requester
          pays  buckets,  see Downloading Objects in Requestor Pays Buckets in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --part-number (integer)
          Part number of the object being read. This is a positive integer be-
          tween 1 and 10,000. Effectively performs a 'ranged' HEAD request for
          the part specified. Useful querying about the size of the  part  and
          the number of parts in this object.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP 403  (Ac-
          cess Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To wait (pause running) until an object no longer exists

       The  following wait object-not-exists example pauses and continues only
       after it can confirm that the specified object (--key) in the specified
       bucket doesn't exist.

          aws s3api wait object-not-exists \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --key doc1.rtf

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
