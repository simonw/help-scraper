PUT-OBJECT-RETENTION()                                  PUT-OBJECT-RETENTION()



NAME
       put-object-retention -

DESCRIPTION
       Places  an Object Retention configuration on an object. For more infor-
       mation, see Locking Objects . Users or accounts require  the  s3:PutOb-
       jectRetention permission in order to place an Object Retention configu-
       ration on objects. Bypassing a Governance Retention  configuration  re-
       quires the s3:BypassGovernanceRetention permission.

       This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
          Permissions

       When  the  Object  Lock  retention  mode is set to compliance, you need
       s3:PutObjectRetention and s3:BypassGovernanceRetention permissions. For
       other  requests to PutObjectRetention , only s3:PutObjectRetention per-
       missions are required.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          [--request-payer <value>]
          [--version-id <value>]
          [--bypass-governance-retention | --no-bypass-governance-retention]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The bucket name that contains the object you want to apply this  Ob-
          ject Retention configuration to.

          When  using  this  action  with an access point, you must direct re-
          quests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes
          the  form  AccessPointName -AccountId .s3-accesspoint.*Region* .ama-
          zonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through  the
          Amazon  Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place
          of the bucket name. For more information about  access  point  ARNs,
          see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --key (string)
          The  key  name for the object that you want to apply this Object Re-
          tention configuration to.

       --retention (structure)
          The container element for the Object Retention configuration.

          Mode -> (string)
              Indicates the Retention mode for the specified object.

          RetainUntilDate -> (timestamp)
              The date on which this Object Lock Retention will expire.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Mode=string,RetainUntilDate=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Mode": "GOVERNANCE"|"COMPLIANCE",
            "RetainUntilDate": timestamp
          }

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for  the
          request.  Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their re-
          quests. For information about  downloading  objects  from  requester
          pays  buckets,  see Downloading Objects in Requestor Pays Buckets in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --version-id (string)
          The version ID for the object that you want to apply this Object Re-
          tention configuration to.

       --bypass-governance-retention | --no-bypass-governance-retention (bool-
       ean)
          Indicates whether this action should bypass Governance-mode restric-
          tions.

       --content-md5 (string)
          The MD5 hash for the request body.

          For  requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line Inter-
          face (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated au-
          tomatically.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The  account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned
          by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP 403  (Ac-
          cess Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       The following put-object-retention example  sets  an  object  retention

              --retention '{ "Mode": "GOVERNANCE", "RetainUntilDate": "2025-01-01T00:00:00" }'

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       RequestCharged -> (string)
          If  present,  indicates  that the requester was successfully charged
          for the request.
