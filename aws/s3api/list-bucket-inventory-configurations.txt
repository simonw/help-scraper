LIST-BUCKET-INVENTORY-CONFIGURATIONS()  LIST-BUCKET-INVENTORY-CONFIGURATIONS()



NAME
       list-bucket-inventory-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of inventory configurations for the bucket. You can have
       up to 1,000 analytics configurations per bucket.

       This action supports list pagination and does not return more than  100
       configurations  at  a time. Always check the IsTruncated element in the
       response. If there are no more configurations to list,  IsTruncated  is
       set  to false. If there are more configurations to list, IsTruncated is
       set to true, and there is a value in NextContinuationToken  .  You  use
       the  NextContinuationToken value to continue the pagination of the list
       by passing the value in continuation-token in the request  to  GET  the
       next page.

       To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3:Get-
       InventoryConfiguration action. The bucket owner has this permission  by
       default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more
       information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subre-
       source Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Re-
       sources .

       Inventory

SYNOPSIS
            list-bucket-inventory-configurations
          --bucket <value>
          [--continuation-token <value>]
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket containing the  inventory  configurations  to
          retrieve.

       --continuation-token (string)
          The  marker used to continue an inventory configuration listing that
          has been truncated. Use the NextContinuationToken from a  previously
          truncated  list  response  to continue the listing. The continuation
          token is an opaque value that Amazon S3 understands.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP 403 (Ac-
          cess Denied) error.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The following list-bucket-inventory-configurations  example  lists  the
       inventory configurations for the specified bucket.
