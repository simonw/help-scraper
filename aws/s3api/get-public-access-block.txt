GET-PUBLIC-ACCESS-BLOCK()                            GET-PUBLIC-ACCESS-BLOCK()



NAME
       get-public-access-block -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the PublicAccessBlock configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket.
       To use this operation, you must have the  s3:GetBucketPublicAccessBlock
       permission.  For  more  information  about  Amazon  S3 permissions, see
       Specifying Permissions in a Policy .

       WARNING:
          When Amazon S3 evaluates the PublicAccessBlock configuration  for  a
          bucket  or  an object, it checks the PublicAccessBlock configuration
          for both the bucket (or the bucket that contains the object) and the
          bucket  owner's  account. If the PublicAccessBlock settings are dif-
          ferent between the bucket and the account, Amazon S3 uses  the  most
          restrictive  combination  of the bucket-level and account-level set-
          tings.

       For more information about when Amazon S3 considers a bucket or an  ob-
       ject public, see The Meaning of "Public" .

SYNOPSIS
            get-public-access-block
          --bucket <value>
          [--expected-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The  name of the Amazon S3 bucket whose PublicAccessBlock configura-
          tion you want to retrieve.

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To set or modify the block public access configuration for a bucket

       The following get-public-access-block example displays the block public
       access configuration for the specified bucket.

          aws s3api get-public-access-block \
              --bucket my-bucket

       Output:

          {
              "PublicAccessBlockConfiguration": {
                  "IgnorePublicAcls": true,
                  "BlockPublicPolicy": true,
                  "BlockPublicAcls": true,
                  "RestrictPublicBuckets": true
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       PublicAccessBlockConfiguration -> (structure)
          The  PublicAccessBlock  configuration  currently  in effect for this
          Amazon S3 bucket.

          BlockPublicAcls -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public  access  control
              lists (ACLs) for this bucket and objects in this bucket. Setting
              this element to TRUE causes the following behavior:

              o PUT Bucket ACL and PUT Object ACL calls fail if the  specified
                ACL is public.

              o PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

              o PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing policies or ACLs.

          IgnorePublicAcls -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for this
              bucket and objects in this bucket. Setting this element to  TRUE
              causes  Amazon  S3  to ignore all public ACLs on this bucket and
              objects in this bucket.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect the persistence of any  ex-
              isting ACLs and doesn't prevent new public ACLs from being set.

          BlockPublicPolicy -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket policies
              for this bucket. Setting this element to TRUE causes  Amazon  S3
              to  reject  calls  to  PUT Bucket policy if the specified bucket
              policy allows public access.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing bucket policies.

          RestrictPublicBuckets -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should restrict public bucket  poli-
              cies for this bucket. Setting this element to TRUE restricts ac-
              cess to this bucket to only Amazon Web  Service  principals  and
              authorized  users within this account if the bucket has a public
              policy.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect  previously  stored  bucket
              policies, except that public and cross-account access within any
              public bucket policy, including non-public  delegation  to  spe-
              cific accounts, is blocked.
