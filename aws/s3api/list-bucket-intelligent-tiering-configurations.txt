       list-bucket-intelligent-tiering-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  S3  Intelligent-Tiering  configuration  from  the specified
       bucket.

       The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize  stor-
       age costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective stor-
       age access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. S3
       Intelligent-Tiering  delivers  automatic  cost savings in three low la-
       tency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest storage  cost
       on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to ac-
       tivate additional archiving capabilities.

       The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for
       data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, indepen-
       dent of object size or retention period. If the size of  an  object  is
       less  than  128 KB, it is not monitored and not eligible for auto-tier-
       ing. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at  the
       Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

       For  more  information,  see Storage class for automatically optimizing
       frequently and infrequently accessed objects .

SYNOPSIS
            list-bucket-intelligent-tiering-configurations
          --bucket <value>
          [--continuation-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The  name  of  the  Amazon S3 bucket whose configuration you want to
          modify or retrieve.

       --continuation-token (string)
          The ContinuationToken that represents a placeholder from where  this
          request should begin.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  the returned list of analytics configurations is
          complete. A value of true indicates that the list  is  not  complete
          and  the NextContinuationToken will be provided for a subsequent re-
          quest.

       ContinuationToken -> (string)
          The ContinuationToken that represents a placeholder from where  this
          request should begin.

       NextContinuationToken -> (string)
          The  marker  used  to continue this inventory configuration listing.
          Use the NextContinuationToken from this  response  to  continue  the
          listing in a subsequent request. The continuation token is an opaque
          value that Amazon S3 understands.

       IntelligentTieringConfigurationList -> (list)
          The list of S3 Intelligent-Tiering configurations for a bucket.

          (structure)
              Specifies the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration for an Amazon
              S3 bucket.

              For  information about the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class,
              see Storage class for automatically  optimizing  frequently  and
              infrequently accessed objects .

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID used to identify the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configura-
                 tion.

              Filter -> (structure)
                 Specifies a bucket filter. The  configuration  only  includes
                 objects that meet the filter's criteria.

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     An  object  key name prefix that identifies the subset of
                     objects to which the rule applies.

                     WARNING:
                        Replacement must be made for  object  keys  containing
                        special characters (such as carriage returns) when us-
                        ing XML requests. For more information,  see  XML  re-
                        lated object key constraints .

                 Tag -> (structure)
                     A container of a key value name pair.

                     Key -> (string)
                        Name of the object key.

                     Value -> (string)

                 And -> (structure)
                     A  conjunction (logical AND) of predicates, which is used
                     in evaluating a metrics filter. The operator must have at
                     least two predicates, and an object must match all of the
                     predicates in order for the filter to apply.

                     Prefix -> (string)
                        An object key name prefix that identifies  the  subset
                        of objects to which the configuration applies.

                     Tags -> (list)
                        All  of  these tags must exist in the object's tag set
                        in order for the configuration to apply.

                        (structure)
                            A container of a key value name pair.

                 Specifies the status of the configuration.

              Tierings -> (list)
                 Specifies the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage  class  tier  of

                 (structure)
                     The  S3  Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to
                     optimize storage costs by automatically  moving  data  to
                     the  most cost-effective storage access tier, without ad-
                     ditional operational overhead.

                        The number of consecutive  days  of  no  access  after
                        which an object will be eligible to be transitioned to
                        the corresponding tier. The  minimum  number  of  days
                        specified  for Archive Access tier must be at least 90
                        days and Deep Archive Access tier must be at least 180
                        days. The maximum can be up to 2 years (730 days).

                        quently accessed objects for a list of access tiers in
                        the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.
