COPY-OBJECT()                                                    COPY-OBJECT()



NAME
       copy-object -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.

       NOTE:
          You  can  store  individual  objects of up to 5 TB in Amazon S3. You
          create a copy of your object up to 5 GB in size in a  single  atomic
          action using this API. However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB,
          you must use the multipart upload Upload Part  -  Copy  (UploadPart-
          Copy) API. For more information, see Copy Object Using the REST Mul-
          tipart Upload API .

       All copy requests must be authenticated. Additionally,  you  must  have
       read  access  to  the source object and write access to the destination
       bucket. For more information, see REST Authentication . Both the Region
       that  you  want to copy the object from and the Region that you want to
       copy the object to must be enabled for your account.

       A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives  the  copy
       request  or  while  Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs
       before the copy action starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3  error.
       If  the  error  occurs during the copy operation, the error response is
       embedded in the 200 OK response. This means that a 200 OK response  can
       contain  either a success or an error. If you call the S3 API directly,
       make sure to design your application to parse the contents of  the  re-
       sponse  and  handle  it  appropriately.  If you use Amazon Web Services
       SDKs, SDKs handle this condition. The SDKs detect  the  embedded  error
       and apply error handling per your configuration settings (including au-
       tomatically retrying the request as appropriate). If the condition per-
       sists,  the  SDKs  throws an exception (or, for the SDKs that don't use
       exceptions, they return the error).

       If the copy is successful, you  receive  a  response  with  information
       about the copied object.

       NOTE:
          If  the  request  is  an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk en-
          coded. If it were not, it would not contain the content-length,  and
          you would need to read the entire body.

       The  copy  request charge is based on the storage class and Region that
       you specify for the destination object. For  pricing  information,  see
       Amazon S3 pricing .

       WARNING:
          Amazon  S3  transfer  acceleration  does  not  support  cross-Region
          copies. If you request a cross-Region copy using a transfer acceler-
          ation  endpoint,  you get a 400 Bad Request error. For more informa-
          tion, see Transfer Acceleration .

          Metadata

       When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (the default)  or
       specify  new  metadata.  However,  the access control list (ACL) is not
       preserved and is set to private for the user  making  the  request.  To
       override  the  default ACL setting, specify a new ACL when generating a
       copy request. For more information, see Using ACLs .

       To specify whether you want the object metadata copied from the  source
       object  or  replaced with metadata provided in the request, you can op-
       tionally add the x-amz-metadata-directive header. When you  grant  per-
       missions,  you can use the s3:x-amz-metadata-directive condition key to
       enforce certain metadata behavior when objects are uploaded.  For  more
       information,  see  Specifying  Conditions  in a Policy in the Amazon S3
       User Guide . For a complete list of Amazon S3-specific condition  keys,
       see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon S3 .

       NOTE:
              x-amz-website-redirect-location  is  unique  to  each object and
              must be specified in the request headers to copy the value.

          x-amz-copy-source-if Headers

       To only copy an object under certain conditions, such  as  whether  the
       Etag matches or whether the object was modified before or after a spec-
       ified date, use the following request parameters:

       o x-amz-copy-source-if-match

       o x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match

       o x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since

       o x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since

       If both the x-amz-copy-source-if-match and x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodi-
       fied-since  headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows,
       Amazon S3 returns 200 OK and copies the data:

       o x-amz-copy-source-if-match condition evaluates to true

       o x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since condition evaluates to false

       If       both       the       x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match       and
       x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since  headers are present in the request
       and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns the 412 Precondition  Failed
       response code:

       o x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match condition evaluates to false

       o x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since condition evaluates to true

       NOTE:
          All  headers  with  the x-amz- prefix, including x-amz-copy-source ,
          must be signed.

          Server-side encryption

       Amazon S3 automatically encrypts all new objects that are copied to  an
       S3  bucket. When copying an object, if you don't specify encryption in-
       formation in your copy request, the encryption setting  of  the  target
       object  is  set to the default encryption configuration of the destina-
       tion bucket. By default, all buckets have a base  level  of  encryption
       configuration  that  uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed
       keys (SSE-S3). If the destination bucket has a default encryption  con-
       figuration that uses server-side encryption with Key Management Service
       (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web
       Services  KMS  keys  (DSSE-KMS),  or  server-side  encryption with cus-
       tomer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C), Amazon S3 uses the  correspond-
       ing  KMS  key,  or a customer-provided key to encrypt the target object
       copy.

       When you perform a CopyObject operation, if you want to use a different
       type of encryption setting for the target object, you can use other ap-
       propriate encryption-related headers to encrypt the target object  with
       a  KMS  key, an Amazon S3 managed key, or a customer-provided key. With
       server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes  your
       data to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access
       it. If the encryption setting in your request is different from the de-
       fault  encryption  configuration of the destination bucket, the encryp-
       tion setting in your request takes precedence. If the source object for
       the  copy is stored in Amazon S3 using SSE-C, you must provide the nec-
       essary encryption information in your request so that Amazon S3 can de-
       crypt  the  object  for copying. For more information about server-side
       encryption, see Using Server-Side Encryption .

       If a target object uses SSE-KMS, you can enable an S3  Bucket  Key  for
       the object. For more information, see Amazon S3 Bucket Keys in the Ama-
       zon S3 User Guide .
          Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers

       When copying an  object,  you  can  optionally  use  headers  to  grant
       ACL-based  permissions.  By  default, all objects are private. Only the
       owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can  grant
       permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined
       groups that are defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then  added
       to the ACL on the object. For more information, see Access Control List
       (ACL) Overview and Managing ACLs Using the REST API .

       If the bucket that you're copying objects to uses the bucket owner  en-
       forced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer
       affect permissions. Buckets that use this setting only accept  PUT  re-
       quests  that  don't  specify an ACL or PUT requests that specify bucket
       owner full control ACLs, such as the  bucket-owner-full-control  canned
       ACL or an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in the XML format.

       For  more  information,  see  Controlling ownership of objects and dis-
       abling ACLs in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       NOTE:
          If your bucket uses the bucket owner  enforced  setting  for  Object
          Ownership,  all objects written to the bucket by any account will be
          owned by the bucket owner.

          Checksums

       When copying an object, if it has a checksum,  that  checksum  will  be
       copied to the new object by default. When you copy the object over, you
       can optionally specify a different checksum algorithm to use  with  the
       x-amz-checksum-algorithm header.
          Storage Class Options

       You can use the CopyObject action to change the storage class of an ob-
       ject that is already stored in Amazon S3 by using the StorageClass  pa-
       rameter.  For  more  information,  see Storage Classes in the Amazon S3
       User Guide .

       If the source object's storage class is GLACIER,  you  must  restore  a
       copy  of  this  object before you can use it as a source object for the
       copy operation. For more information, see RestoreObject . For more  in-
       formation, see Copying Objects .
          Versioning

       By  default, x-amz-copy-source header identifies the current version of
       an object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3
       behaves  as if the object was deleted. To copy a different version, use
       the versionId subresource.

       If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon  S3  generates  a
       unique  version ID for the object being copied. This version ID is dif-
       ferent from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns  the
       version ID of the copied object in the x-amz-version-id response header
       in the response.

       If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the
       version ID that Amazon S3 generates is always null.

       The following operations are related to CopyObject :

       o PutObject

OPTIONS
       --acl (string)
          The canned ACL to apply to the object.

          This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          Possible values:

          o private

          o public-read

          o public-read-write

          o authenticated-read

          o aws-exec-read

          o bucket-owner-read

          o bucket-owner-full-control

       --bucket (string)
          The name of the destination bucket.

          When  using  this  action  with an access point, you must direct re-
          quests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes
          the  form  AccessPointName -AccountId .s3-accesspoint.*Region* .ama-
          zonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through  the
          Amazon  Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place
          of the bucket name. For more information about  access  point  ARNs,
          see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
          requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
          takes  the  form `` AccessPointName -AccountId .*outpostID* .s3-out-
          posts.*Region* .amazonaws.com`` . When you use this action  with  S3
          on  Outposts  through  the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the
          Outposts access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more  in-
          formation  about  S3 on Outposts ARNs, see What is S3 on Outposts in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --cache-control (string)
          Specifies caching behavior along the request/reply chain.

       --checksum-algorithm (string)
          Indicates the algorithm you want Amazon S3  to  use  to  create  the
          checksum  for  the object. For more information, see Checking object
          integrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o CRC32

          o CRC32C

          o SHA1

          o SHA256

       --content-disposition (string)
          Specifies presentational information for the object.

       --content-encoding (string)
          Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and
          thus  what  decoding  mechanisms  must  be applied to obtain the me-
          dia-type referenced by the Content-Type header field.

       --content-language (string)
          The language the content is in.

       --content-type (string)
          A standard MIME type describing the format of the object data.

       --copy-source (string)
          Specifies the source object for the copy operation. You specify  the
          value in one of two formats, depending on whether you want to access
          the source object through an access point :

          o For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name
            of  the  source bucket and the key of the source object, separated
            by a slash (/). For example,  to  copy  the  object  reports/janu-
            ary.pdf   from  the  bucket  awsexamplebucket  ,  use  awsexample-
            bucket/reports/january.pdf . The value must be URL-encoded.

          o For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon Re-
            source  Name  (ARN)  of  the object as accessed through the access
            point,  in  the  format   arn:aws:s3:<Region>:<account-id>:access-
            point/<access-point-name>/object/<key>  . For example, to copy the
            object reports/january.pdf through  access  point  my-access-point
            owned  by  account  123456789012 in Region us-west-2 , use the URL
            encoding  of  arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-ac-
            cess-point/object/reports/january.pdf  . The value must be URL en-
            coded.

          NOTE:
                 Amazon S3 supports copy operations using access  points  only
                 when  the source and destination buckets are in the same Ama-
                 zon Web Services Region.

              Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon  S3  on  Out-
              posts,  specify  the ARN of the object as accessed in the format
              arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<out-
              post-id>/object/<key>  .  For  example,  to  copy the object re-
              ports/january.pdf through outpost my-outpost  owned  by  account
              123456789012  in  Region  us-west-2  ,  use  the URL encoding of
              arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-out-
              post/object/reports/january.pdf . The value must be URL-encoded.

          To  copy  a  specific  version of an object, append ?versionId=<ver-
          sion-id> to the value (for  example,  awsexamplebucket/reports/janu-
          ary.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893   ).   If  you
          don't specify a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest  version  of
          the source object.

       --copy-source-if-match (string)
          Copies  the  object  if  its entity tag (ETag) matches the specified
          tag.

       --copy-source-if-modified-since (timestamp)
          Copies the object if it has been modified since the specified time.

       --copy-source-if-none-match (string)
          Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag)  is  different  than  the
          specified ETag.

       --copy-source-if-unmodified-since (timestamp)
          Copies  the  object  if  it hasn't been modified since the specified
          time.

       --expires (timestamp)
          The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.

       --grant-full-control (string)
          Gives the grantee READ, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP permissions  on  the
          object.

          This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       --grant-read (string)
          Allows grantee to read the object data and its metadata.

          This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       --grant-read-acp (string)
          Allows grantee to read the object ACL.

          This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       --grant-write-acp (string)
          Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable object.

          This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       --key (string)
          The key of the destination object.

       --metadata (map)
          A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --metadata-directive (string)
          Specifies  whether  the metadata is copied from the source object or
          replaced with metadata provided in the request.

          Possible values:

          o COPY

          o REPLACE

       --tagging-directive (string)
          Specifies whether the object tag-set are copied from the source  ob-
          ject or replaced with tag-set provided in the request.

          Possible values:

          o COPY

          o REPLACE

       --server-side-encryption (string)
          The  server-side  encryption algorithm used when storing this object
          in Amazon S3 (for example, AES256 , aws:kms , aws:kms:dsse ).

          Possible values:

          o AES256

          o aws:kms

          o aws:kms:dsse

       --storage-class (string)
          By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly
          created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability
          and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can spec-
          ify  a  different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the

       --website-redirect-location (string)
          If  the  bucket  is  configured as a website, redirects requests for
          this object to another object in the same bucket or to  an  external
          URL.  Amazon  S3 stores the value of this header in the object meta-
          data. This value is unique to each object and is not copied when us-
          ing  the  x-amz-metadata-directive  header.  Instead, you may opt to
          provide this header in combination with the directive.

       --sse-customer-algorithm (string)
          Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting  the  object  (for
          example, AES256).

       --sse-customer-key (string)
          Specifies  the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use
          in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and  then
          it  is  discarded;  Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The
          key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in  the
          x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm header.

       --sse-customer-key-md5 (string)
          Specifies  the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to
          RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message  integrity  check
          to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

       --ssekms-key-id (string)
          Specifies  the  KMS key ID to use for object encryption. All GET and
          PUT requests for an object protected by KMS will fail if they're not
          made  via  SSL or using SigV4. For information about configuring any
          of the officially supported Amazon Web Services SDKs and Amazon  Web
          Services  CLI,  see  Specifying the Signature Version in Request Au-
          thentication in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --ssekms-encryption-context (string)
          Specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS Encryption Context to use  for
          object  encryption.  The  value  of  this header is a base64-encoded
          UTF-8 string holding JSON  with  the  encryption  context  key-value
          pairs.

       --bucket-key-enabled | --no-bucket-key-enabled (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object
          encryption with server-side encryption using Key Management  Service
          (KMS)  keys  (SSE-KMS). Setting this header to true causes Amazon S3
          to use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with SSE-KMS.

          Specifying this header with a COPY action doesnt affect bucket-level
          settings for S3 Bucket Key.

       --copy-source-sse-customer-algorithm (string)
          Specifies  the  algorithm  to  use when decrypting the source object
          (for example, AES256).

       --copy-source-sse-customer-key (string)
          Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to  use
          to  decrypt  the  source object. The encryption key provided in this
          header must be one that was used when the source object was created.

       --copy-source-sse-customer-key-md5 (string)
          Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according  to
          RFC  1321.  Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check
          to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

       --request-payer (string)
          Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for  the
          request.  Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their re-
          quests. For information about  downloading  objects  from  Requester
          Pays  buckets,  see Downloading Objects in Requester Pays Buckets in
          the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o requester

       --tagging (string)
          The tag-set for the object destination object  this  value  must  be
          used  in conjunction with the TaggingDirective . The tag-set must be
          encoded as URL Query parameters.

       --object-lock-mode (string)
          The Object Lock mode that you want to apply to the copied object.

          Possible values:

          o GOVERNANCE

          o COMPLIANCE

       --object-lock-retain-until-date (timestamp)
          The date and time when you want the copied object's Object  Lock  to
          expire.

       --object-lock-legal-hold-status (string)
          Specifies  whether  you want to apply a legal hold to the copied ob-
          ject.

          Possible values:

          o ON

          o OFF

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected destination bucket owner. If the des-
          tination  bucket  is owned by a different account, the request fails
          with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --expected-source-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected source bucket owner.  If  the  source
          bucket  is  owned by a different account, the request fails with the
          HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
