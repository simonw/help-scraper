SELECT-OBJECT-CONTENT()                                SELECT-OBJECT-CONTENT()



NAME
       select-object-content -

DESCRIPTION
       This action filters the contents of an Amazon S3 object based on a sim-
       ple structured query language (SQL) statement. In  the  request,  along
       with  the  SQL  expression,  you must also specify a data serialization
       format (JSON, CSV, or Apache Parquet) of the  object.  Amazon  S3  uses
       this format to parse object data into records, and returns only records
       that match the specified SQL expression. You must also specify the data
       serialization format for the response.

       This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       For more information about Amazon S3 Select, see Selecting Content from
       Objects and SELECT Command in the Amazon S3 User Guide .
          Permissions

       You must have s3:GetObject permission for this operation. Amazon S3 Se-
       lect does not support anonymous access. For more information about per-
       missions, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy in the Amazon S3  User
       Guide .
          Object Data Formats

       You  can  use Amazon S3 Select to query objects that have the following
       format properties:

       o CSV, JSON, and Parquet - Objects must be in  CSV,  JSON,  or  Parquet
         format.

       o UTF-8 - UTF-8 is the only encoding type Amazon S3 Select supports.

       o GZIP  or  BZIP2  - CSV and JSON files can be compressed using GZIP or
         BZIP2. GZIP and BZIP2 are the only compression formats that Amazon S3
         Select  supports  for  CSV  and JSON files. Amazon S3 Select supports
         columnar compression for Parquet using GZIP or Snappy. Amazon S3  Se-
         lect does not support whole-object compression for Parquet objects.

       o Server-side  encryption  - Amazon S3 Select supports querying objects
         that are protected with server-side encryption. For objects that  are
         encrypted  with  customer-provided  encryption keys (SSE-C), you must
         use HTTPS, and you must use the headers that are  documented  in  the
         GetObject . For more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryp-
         tion (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) in the Amazon S3  User
         Guide  .  For  objects that are encrypted with Amazon S3 managed keys
         (SSE-S3) and Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS), server-side  en-
         cryption  is handled transparently, so you don't need to specify any-
         thing. For more information about server-side  encryption,  including
         SSE-S3  and SSE-KMS, see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption
         in the Amazon S3 User Guide .
          Working with the Response Body

       Given the response size is unknown, Amazon S3 Select  streams  the  re-
       sponse  as a series of messages and includes a Transfer-Encoding header
       with chunked as its value in the response. For  more  information,  see
       Appendix: SelectObjectContent Response .
          GetObject Support

       The SelectObjectContent action does not support the following GetObject
       functionality. For more information, see GetObject .

       o Range : Although you can specify a scan range for an Amazon S3 Select
         request  (see  SelectObjectContentRequest  - ScanRange in the request
         parameters), you cannot specify the range of bytes of  an  object  to
         return.

       o GLACIER,  DEEP_ARCHIVE  and  REDUCED_REDUNDANCY  storage classes: You
         cannot specify the GLACIER, DEEP_ARCHIVE, or REDUCED_REDUNDANCY stor-
         age  classes. For more information, about storage classes see Storage
         Classes in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                 o NONE : First line is not a header.

                 o IGNORE  :  First  line  is  a header, but you can't use the
                   header values to indicate the column in an expression.  You
                   can  use column position (such as _1, _2, ) to indicate the
                   column (SELECT s._1 FROM OBJECT s ).

                 o Use : First line is a header, and you can  use  the  header
                   value  to identify a column in an expression (SELECT "name"
                   FROM OBJECT ).

              Comments -> (string)
                 A single character used to indicate that a row should be  ig-
                 nored when the character is present at the start of that row.
                 You can specify any character to indicate a comment line. The
                 default character is # .

                 Default: #

              QuoteEscapeCharacter -> (string)
                 A single character used for escaping the quotation mark char-
                 acter inside an already escaped value. For example, the value
                 """ a , b """ is parsed as " a , b " .

              RecordDelimiter -> (string)
                 A single character used to separate individual records in the
                 input. Instead of the default value, you can specify an arbi-
                 trary delimiter.

              FieldDelimiter -> (string)
                 A  single  character  used to separate individual fields in a

              QuoteCharacter -> (string)
                 A single character used for escaping when the field delimiter
                 is  part  of  the  value. For example, if the value is a, b ,
                 Amazon S3 wraps this field value in quotation marks, as  fol-
                 lows: " a , b " .

                 Type: String

                 Default: "

                 Ancestors: CSV

              AllowQuotedRecordDelimiter -> (boolean)
                 Specifies that CSV field values may contain quoted record de-
                 limiters and such records should be allowed. Default value is
                 FALSE. Setting this value to TRUE may lower performance.

          CompressionType -> (string)
              Specifies object's compression format. Valid values: NONE, GZIP,
              BZIP2. Default Value: NONE.

                   needed.

              QuoteEscapeCharacter -> (string)
                 The  single  character  used for escaping the quote character
                 inside an already escaped value.

              RecordDelimiter -> (string)
                 A single character used to separate individual records in the
                 output.  Instead of the default value, you can specify an ar-
                 bitrary delimiter.

              FieldDelimiter -> (string)
                 The value used to separate individual fields in a record. You
                 can specify an arbitrary delimiter.

              QuoteCharacter -> (string)
                 A single character used for escaping when the field delimiter
                 is part of the value. For example, if the value  is  a,  b  ,
                 Amazon  S3 wraps this field value in quotation marks, as fol-
                 lows: " a , b " .

          JSON -> (structure)
              Specifies JSON as request's output serialization format.

                 The value used to separate individual records in the  output.
                 If  no value is specified, Amazon S3 uses a newline character
                 ('n').

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CSV={QuoteFields=string,QuoteEscapeCharacter=string,RecordDelimiter=string,FieldDelimiter=string,QuoteCharacter=string},JSON={RecordDelimiter=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CSV": {
              "QuoteFields": "ALWAYS"|"ASNEEDED",
              "QuoteEscapeCharacter": "string",
              "RecordDelimiter": "string",
              "FieldDelimiter": "string",
              "QuoteCharacter": "string"
            },
            "JSON": {
              "RecordDelimiter": "string"
            }
          }

       --scan-range (structure)
          Specifies the byte range of the object to get the  records  from.  A
          record  is  processed when its first byte is contained by the range.
          This parameter is optional, but  when  specified,  it  must  not  be
          empty.  See RFC 2616, Section 14.35.1 about how to specify the start
          and end of the range.
              ScanRange may be used in the following ways:

          o <scanrange><start>50</start><end>100</end></scanrange>  -  process
            only the records starting between the bytes 50 and 100 (inclusive,
            counting from zero)

          o <scanrange><start>50</start></scanrange>  -   process   only   the
            records starting after the byte 50

          o <scanrange><end>50</end></scanrange>  -  process  only the records
            within the last 50 bytes of the file.

          Start -> (long)
              Specifies the start of the byte range.  This  parameter  is  op-
              tional.  Valid  values: non-negative integers. The default value
              is 0. If only start is supplied, it means scan from  that  point
              to    the    end    of    the    file.   For   example,   <scan-
              range><start>50</start></scanrange> means scan from byte 50  un-
              til the end of the file.

          End -> (long)
              Specifies the end of the byte range. This parameter is optional.
              Valid values: non-negative integers. The default  value  is  one
              less  than the size of the object being queried. If only the End
              parameter is supplied, it is interpreted to mean scan the last N
              bytes  of the file. For example, <scanrange><end>50</end></scan-
              range> means scan the last 50 bytes.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Start=long,End=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Start": long,
            "End": long
          }

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
          403 Forbidden (access denied).

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To filter the contents of an Amazon S3 object based on an SQL statement

       The   following   select-object-content   example  filters  the  object
       my-data-file.csv with the specified SQL statement and sends output to a
       file.

          aws s3api select-object-content \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --key my-data-file.csv \
              --expression "select * from s3object limit 100" \
              --expression-type 'SQL' \
              --input-serialization '{"CSV": {}, "CompressionType": "NONE"}' \
              --output-serialization '{"CSV": {}}' "output.csv"

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       This command generates no output.  The selected object content is writ-
       ten to the specified outfile.
