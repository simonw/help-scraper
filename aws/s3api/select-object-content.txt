SELECT-OBJECT-CONTENT()                                SELECT-OBJECT-CONTENT()



NAME
       select-object-content -

DESCRIPTION
       This action filters the contents of an Amazon S3 object based on a sim-
       ple structured query language (SQL) statement. In  the  request,  along
       with  the  SQL  expression,  you must also specify a data serialization
       format (JSON, CSV, or Apache Parquet) of the  object.  Amazon  S3  uses
       this format to parse object data into records, and returns only records
       that match the specified SQL expression. You must also specify the data
       serialization format for the response.

       This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       For more information about Amazon S3 Select, see Selecting Content from
       Objects and SELECT Command in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       For more information about using SQL with Amazon  S3  Select,  see  SQL
       Reference  for  Amazon S3 Select and S3 Glacier Select in the Amazon S3
       User Guide .
          Permissions

       You must have s3:GetObject permission for this operation. Amazon S3 Se-
       lect does not support anonymous access. For more information about per-
       missions, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy in the Amazon S3  User
       Guide .
          Object Data Formats

       You  can  use Amazon S3 Select to query objects that have the following
       format properties:

       o CSV, JSON, and Parquet - Objects must be in  CSV,  JSON,  or  Parquet
         format.

       o UTF-8 - UTF-8 is the only encoding type Amazon S3 Select supports.

       o GZIP  or  BZIP2  - CSV and JSON files can be compressed using GZIP or
         BZIP2. GZIP and BZIP2 are the only compression formats that Amazon S3
         Select  supports  for  CSV  and JSON files. Amazon S3 Select supports
         columnar compression for Parquet using GZIP or Snappy. Amazon S3  Se-
         lect does not support whole-object compression for Parquet objects.

       o Server-side  encryption  - Amazon S3 Select supports querying objects
         that are protected with server-side encryption. For objects that  are
         encrypted  with  customer-provided  encryption keys (SSE-C), you must
         use HTTPS, and you must use the headers that are  documented  in  the
         GetObject . For more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryp-
         tion (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) in the Amazon S3  User
         Guide . For objects that are encrypted with Amazon S3 managed encryp-
         tion keys (SSE-S3)  and  Amazon  Web  Services  KMS  keys  (SSE-KMS),
         server-side encryption is handled transparently, so you don't need to
         specify anything. For more information about server-side  encryption,
         including  SSE-S3  and SSE-KMS, see Protecting Data Using Server-Side
         Encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide .
          Working with the Response Body

       Given the response size is unknown, Amazon S3 Select  streams  the  re-
       sponse  as a series of messages and includes a Transfer-Encoding header
       with chunked as its value in the response. For  more  information,  see
       Appendix: SelectObjectContent Response .
          GetObject Support

       The SelectObjectContent action does not support the following GetObject
       functionality. For more information, see GetObject .

       o Range : Although you can specify a scan range for an Amazon S3 Select
         request  (see  SelectObjectContentRequest  - ScanRange in the request
         parameters), you cannot specify the range of bytes of  an  object  to
         return.

       o GLACIER,  DEEP_ARCHIVE  and  REDUCED_REDUNDANCY  storage classes: You
         cannot specify the GLACIER, DEEP_ARCHIVE, or REDUCED_REDUNDANCY stor-
         age  classes. For more information, about storage classes see Storage
         Classes in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

          The expression that is used to query the object.

       --expression-type (string)
          The type of the provided expression (for example, SQL).

          Possible values:

          o SQL

       --request-progress (structure)
          Specifies  if  periodic  request  progress information should be en-
          abled.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether periodic QueryProgress frames should be  sent.
              Valid values: TRUE, FALSE. Default value: FALSE.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Enabled=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Enabled": true|false
          }

       --input-serialization (structure)
          Describes  the  format  of  the  data  in  the  object that is being
          queried.

          CSV -> (structure)
              Describes the serialization of a CSV-encoded object.

              FileHeaderInfo -> (string)
                 Describes the first line of input. Valid values are:

                 o NONE : First line is not a header.

                 o IGNORE : First line is a header,  but  you  can't  use  the
                   header  values to indicate the column in an expression. You
                   can use column position (such as _1, _2, ) to indicate  the
                   column (SELECT s._1 FROM OBJECT s ).

                 o Use  :  First  line is a header, and you can use the header
                   value to identify a column in an expression (SELECT  "name"
                   FROM OBJECT ).

              Comments -> (string)
                 A  single character used to indicate that a row should be ig-
                 nored when the character is present at the start of that row.
                 You can specify any character to indicate a comment line.

              QuoteEscapeCharacter -> (string)
                 A single character used for escaping the quotation mark char-
                 acter inside an already escaped value. For example, the value
                 """ a , b """ is parsed as " a , b ".

              RecordDelimiter -> (string)
                 A single character used to separate individual records in the
                 input. Instead of the default value, you can specify an arbi-
                 trary delimiter.

              FieldDelimiter -> (string)
                 A  single  character  used to separate individual fields in a
                 record. You can specify an arbitrary delimiter.

              QuoteCharacter -> (string)
                 A single character used for escaping when the field delimiter
                 is  part  of  the  value. For example, if the value is a, b ,
                 Amazon S3 wraps this field value in quotation marks, as  fol-
                 lows: " a , b " .

                 Type: String

                 Default: "

                 Ancestors: CSV

              AllowQuotedRecordDelimiter -> (boolean)
                 Specifies that CSV field values may contain quoted record de-
                 limiters and such records should be allowed. Default value is
                 FALSE. Setting this value to TRUE may lower performance.

          CompressionType -> (string)
              Specifies object's compression format. Valid values: NONE, GZIP,
              BZIP2. Default Value: NONE.

          JSON -> (structure)
              Specifies JSON as object's input serialization format.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of JSON. Valid values: Document, Lines.

            },
            "Parquet": {

            }
          }

       --output-serialization (structure)
          Describes the format of the data that you want Amazon S3  to  return
          in response.

                   needed.

              QuoteEscapeCharacter -> (string)
                 The  single  character  used for escaping the quote character
                 inside an already escaped value.

              RecordDelimiter -> (string)
                 A single character used to separate individual records in the
                 output.  Instead of the default value, you can specify an ar-
                 bitrary delimiter.

              FieldDelimiter -> (string)
                 The value used to separate individual fields in a record. You
                 can specify an arbitrary delimiter.

              QuoteCharacter -> (string)
                 A single character used for escaping when the field delimiter
                 is part of the value. For example, if the value  is  a,  b  ,
                 Amazon  S3 wraps this field value in quotation marks, as fol-
                 lows: " a , b " .

          JSON -> (structure)
              Specifies JSON as request's output serialization format.

              RecordDelimiter -> (string)
                 The value used to separate individual records in the  output.
                 If  no value is specified, Amazon S3 uses a newline character
                 ('n').

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CSV={QuoteFields=string,QuoteEscapeCharacter=string,RecordDelimiter=string,FieldDelimiter=string,QuoteCharacter=string},JSON={RecordDelimiter=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CSV": {
              "QuoteFields": "ALWAYS"|"ASNEEDED",
              "QuoteEscapeCharacter": "string",
              "RecordDelimiter": "string",
              "FieldDelimiter": "string",
              "QuoteCharacter": "string"
            },
            "JSON": {
              "RecordDelimiter": "string"
            }
          }

       --scan-range (structure)
          Specifies the byte range of the object to get the  records  from.  A
          record  is  processed when its first byte is contained by the range.
          This parameter is optional, but  when  specified,  it  must  not  be
          empty.  See RFC 2616, Section 14.35.1 about how to specify the start
          and end of the range.
              ScanRange may be used in the following ways:

          o <scanrange><start>50</start><end>100</end></scanrange>  -  process
            only the records starting between the bytes 50 and 100 (inclusive,
            counting from zero)

          o <scanrange><start>50</start></scanrange>  -   process   only   the
            records starting after the byte 50

          o <scanrange><end>50</end></scanrange>  -  process  only the records
            within the last 50 bytes of the file.

          Start -> (long)
              Specifies the start of the byte range.  This  parameter  is  op-
              tional.  Valid  values: non-negative integers. The default value
              is 0. If only start is supplied, it means scan from  that  point
              to     the    end    of    the    file.For    example;    <scan-
              range><start>50</start></scanrange> means scan from byte 50  un-
              til the end of the file.

          End -> (long)
              Specifies the end of the byte range. This parameter is optional.
              Valid values: non-negative integers. The default  value  is  one
              less  than the size of the object being queried. If only the End
              parameter is supplied, it is interpreted to mean scan the last N
              bytes  of the file. For example, <scanrange><end>50</end></scan-
              range> means scan the last 50 bytes.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Start=long,End=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Start": long,
            "End": long
          }

       --expected-bucket-owner (string)
          The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is  owned
          by  a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP 403 (Ac-
          cess Denied) error.

       outfile (string) Filename where the records will be saved

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
