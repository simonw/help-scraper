PUT-OBJECT()                                                      PUT-OBJECT()



NAME
       put-object -

DESCRIPTION
       Uploads an object to the specified path. Object sizes are limited to 25
       MB for standard upload availability and  10  MB  for  streaming  upload
       availability.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-object
          --body <value>
          --path <value>
          [--content-type <value>]
          [--cache-control <value>]
          [--storage-class <value>]
          [--upload-availability <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --body (blob)
          The bytes to be stored.

       --path (string)
          The path (including the file name) where the object is stored in the
          container. Format: <folder name>/<folder name>/<file name>

          For example, to upload the file mlaw.avi to  the  folder  path  pre-
          mium\canada   in   the  container  movies  ,  enter  the  path  pre-
          mium/canada/mlaw.avi .

          Do not include the container name in this path.

          If the path includes any folders that don't exist yet,  the  service
          creates  them. For example, suppose you have an existing premium/usa
          subfolder. If you specify premium/canada ,  the  service  creates  a
          canada  subfolder  in the premium folder. You then have two subfold-
          ers, usa and canada , in the premium folder.

          There is no correlation between the path to the source and the  path
          (folders) in the container in AWS Elemental MediaStore.

          For  more  information  about  folders  and how they exist in a con-
          tainer, see the AWS Elemental MediaStore User Guide .

          The file name is the name that is assigned to the file that you  up-
          load. The file can have the same name inside and outside of AWS Ele-
          mental MediaStore, or it can have the same name. The file  name  can
          include or omit an extension.

       --content-type (string)
          The content type of the object.

       --cache-control (string)
          An  optional  CacheControl  header that allows the caller to control
          the object's cache behavior. Headers can be passed in  as  specified
          in                   the                   HTTP                   at
          https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9 .

          Headers with a custom user-defined value are also accepted.

       --storage-class (string)
          Indicates the storage class of a Put request. Defaults to  high-per-
          formance  temporal  storage  class,  and  objects are persisted into
          durable storage shortly after being received.

          Possible values:

          o TEMPORAL

       --upload-availability (string)
          Indicates the availability of an object while it is still uploading.
          If the value is set to streaming , the object is available for down-
          loading after some initial buffering but before the  object  is  up-
          loaded  completely.  If the value is set to standard , the object is
          available for downloading only when it is uploaded  completely.  The
          default value for this header is standard .

          To  use  this  header,  you must also set the HTTP Transfer-Encoding
          header to chunked .

          Possible values:

          o STANDARD

          o STREAMING

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The following put-object example upload an object to the specified con-
       tainer.

              --path ReadMe.md \

              --content-type binary/octet-stream

       Output:

          {

              "ETag": "2aa333bbcc8d8d22d777e999c88d4aa9eeeeee4dd89ff7f555555555555da6d3"
          }

       Example 2: To upload an object to a folder within a container

       The  following  put-object  example  upload  an object to the specified
       folder within a container.

          aws mediastore-data put-object \
              --endpoint https://aaabbbcccdddee.data.mediastore.us-west-2.amazonaws.com \
              --body ReadMe.md \
              --path /september-events/ReadMe.md \

              --content-type binary/octet-stream
