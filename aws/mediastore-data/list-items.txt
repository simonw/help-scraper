LIST-ITEMS()                                                      LIST-ITEMS()



NAME
       list-items -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  a  list  of metadata entries about folders and objects in the
       specified folder.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-items is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: Items

SYNOPSIS
            list-items
          [--path <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --path (string)
          The  path  in  the  container  from which to retrieve items. Format:
          <folder name>/<folder name>/<file name>

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Items -> (list)
          The  metadata  entries  for the folders and objects at the requested
          path.

          (structure)
              A metadata entry for a folder or object.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the item.

              Type -> (string)
                 The item type (folder or object).

              ETag -> (string)
                 The ETag that represents a unique instance of the item.

              LastModified -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the item was last modified.

              ContentType -> (string)
                 The content type of the item.

              ContentLength -> (long)
                 The length of the item in bytes.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token that can be used in a request to view the next set of  re-
          sults.  For  example,  you  submit  a ListItems request that matches
          2,000 items with MaxResults set at  500.  The  service  returns  the
          first batch of results (up to 500) and a NextToken value that can be
          used to fetch the next batch of results.
