NAME
       list-queued-messages -

DESCRIPTION
       The operation to list queued messages.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-queued-messages
          --id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--wireless-device-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          Id  of  a  given wireless device which the downlink packets are tar-
          geted

       --next-token (string)
          To retrieve the next set of results, the nextToken value from a pre-
          vious response; otherwise null to receive the first set of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in this operation.

       --wireless-device-type (string)
          The wireless device type, it is either Sidewalk or LoRaWAN.

          Possible values:

          o Sidewalk

          o LoRaWAN

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          To retrieve the next set of results, the nextToken value from a pre-

              MessageId -> (string)

              TransmitMode -> (integer)
                 The transmit mode to use to send data to the wireless device.
                 Can be: 0 for UM (unacknowledge mode) or 1 for  AM  (acknowl-
                 edge mode).

              ReceivedAt -> (string)
                 The timestamp that Iot Wireless received the message.

              LoRaWAN -> (structure)

                 FPort -> (integer)
