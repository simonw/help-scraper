NAME
       get-wireless-device-statistics -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets operating information about a wireless device.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-wireless-device-statistics
          --wireless-device-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --wireless-device-id (string)
          The ID of the wireless device for which to get the data.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get operating information about a wireless device

       The following get-wireless-device-statistics example gets operating in-
       formation about a wireless device.

          aws iotwireless get-wireless-device-statistics \
              --wireless-device-id "1ffd32c8-8130-4194-96df-622f072a315f"

       Output:

          {
              "WirelessDeviceId": "1ffd32c8-8130-4194-96df-622f072a315f"
          }
