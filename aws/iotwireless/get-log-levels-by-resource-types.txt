NAME
       get-log-levels-by-resource-types -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  current  default  log  levels or log levels by resource types.
       Based on resource types, log levels can be for wireless device log  op-
       tions or wireless gateway log options.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-log-levels-by-resource-types
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DefaultLogLevel -> (string)
          The log level for a log message. The log levels can be disabled,  or
          set  to ERROR to display less verbose logs containing only error in-
          formation, or to INFO for more detailed logs.

       WirelessGatewayLogOptions -> (list)
          The list of wireless gateway log options.

          (structure)
              The log options for wireless gateways and can be used to set log
              levels for a specific type of wireless gateway.

              Type -> (string)
                 The wireless gateway type.

              LogLevel -> (string)
                 The  log  level for a log message. The log levels can be dis-
                 abled, or set to ERROR to display less verbose logs  contain-
                 ing  only  error  information,  or  to INFO for more detailed
                 logs.

              Events -> (list)
                 The list of wireless gateway event log options.

                 (structure)
                     The log options for a wireless gateway event and  can  be
                     used  to  set  log levels for a specific wireless gateway
                     event.

                     For a LoRaWAN gateway, possible events for a log  message
                     are CUPS_Request and Certificate .

                     Event -> (string)
                        The  event  for  a  log message, if the log message is
                        tied to a wireless gateway.

                     LogLevel -> (string)
                        The log level for a log message. The log levels can be
                        disabled, or set to ERROR to display less verbose logs
                        containing only error information, or to INFO for more
                        detailed logs.

          The list of wireless device log options.

          (structure)
              The  log options for wireless devices and can be used to set log
              levels for a specific type of wireless device.

              Type -> (string)
                 The wireless device type.

              LogLevel -> (string)
                 The log level for a log message. The log levels can  be  dis-
                 abled,  or set to ERROR to display less verbose logs contain-
                 ing only error information, or  to  INFO  for  more  detailed
                 logs.

              Events -> (list)
                 The list of wireless device event log options.

                 (structure)
                     The  log  options  for a wireless device event and can be
                     used to set log levels for  a  specific  wireless  device
                     event.

                     For  a LoRaWAN device, possible events for a log messsage
                     are: Join , Rejoin , Downlink_Data ,  and  Uplink_Data  .
                     For  a Sidewalk device, possible events for a log message
                     are Registration , Downlink_Data , and Uplink_Data .

                     Event -> (string)
                        The event for a log message, if  the  log  message  is
                        tied to a wireless device.

                     LogLevel -> (string)
                        The log level for a log message. The log levels can be
                        disabled, or set to ERROR to display less verbose logs
