DEFINE-INDEX-FIELD()                                      DEFINE-INDEX-FIELD()



NAME
       define-index-field -

DESCRIPTION
       Configures an `` IndexField`` for the search domain. Used to create new
       fields and modify existing ones. You must specify the name of  the  do-
       main  you  are  configuring and an index field configuration. The index
       field configuration specifies a unique name, the index field type,  and
       the  options  you  want to configure for the field. The options you can
       specify depend on the `` IndexFieldType`` . If the  field  exists,  the
       new  configuration  replaces  the  old  one.  For more information, see
       Configuring Index Fields in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            define-index-field
          --domain-name <value>
          --name <value>
          --type <value>
          [--default-value <value>]
          [--facet-enabled <value>]
          [--search-enabled <value>]
          [--return-enabled <value>]
          [--sort-enabled <value>]
          [--highlight-enabled <value>]
          [--analysis-scheme <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          A string that represents the name of  a  domain.  Domain  names  are
          unique  across the domains owned by an account within an AWS region.
          Domain names start with a letter or number and can contain the  fol-
          lowing characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

       --name (string)
          A  string  that  represents  the name of an index field. CloudSearch
          supports regular index fields as well as dynamic fields.  A  dynamic
          field's  name defines a pattern that begins or ends with a wildcard.
          Any document fields that don't map to a regular index field  but  do
          match  a  dynamic  field's  pattern  are configured with the dynamic
          field's indexing options.

          Regular field names begin with a letter and can contain the  follow-
          ing  characters:  a-z  (lowercase), 0-9, and _ (underscore). Dynamic
          field names must begin or end with a wildcard (*). The wildcard  can
          also  be  the only character in a dynamic field name. Multiple wild-
          cards, and wildcards embedded within a string are not supported.

          The name score is reserved and cannot be used as a  field  name.  To
          reference a document's ID, you can use the name _id .

       --type (string)
          The type of field. The valid options for a field depend on the field
          type. For more information about  the  supported  field  types,  see
          Configuring Index Fields in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide .

       --default-value  (string)  A  value  to  use for the field if the field
       isn't specified for a document. This can be important if you are  using
       the field in an expression and that field is not present in every docu-
       ment.

       --facet-enabled (boolean)
          Whether facet information can be returned for the field.

       --search-enabled (boolean)
          Whether the contents of the field are searchable.

       --return-enabled (boolean)
          Whether the contents of the field can be returned in the search  re-
          sults.

       --sort-enabled (boolean)
          Whether the field can be used to sort the search results.

       --highlight-enabled (boolean)
          Whether highlights can be returned for the field.

       --analysis-scheme (string)
          The name of an analysis scheme for a text field.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       IndexField -> (structure)
          The value of an IndexField and its current status.

          Options -> (structure)
              Configuration  information  for  a field in the index, including
              its name, type, and options. The supported options depend on the
              `` IndexFieldType`` .

              IndexFieldName -> (string)
                 A  string  that represents the name of an index field. Cloud-
                 Search supports regular  index  fields  as  well  as  dynamic
                 fields.  A dynamic field's name defines a pattern that begins
                 or ends with a wildcard. Any document fields that  don't  map
                 to  a regular index field but do match a dynamic field's pat-
                 tern are configured with the  dynamic  field's  indexing  op-
                 tions.

                 Regular  field  names begin with a letter and can contain the
                 following characters: a-z (lowercase),  0-9,  and  _  (under-
                 score). Dynamic field names must begin or end with a wildcard
                 (*). The wildcard can also be the only character in a dynamic
                 field name. Multiple wildcards, and wildcards embedded within
                 a string are not supported.

                 The name score is reserved and cannot  be  used  as  a  field
                 name.  To reference a document's ID, you can use the name _id
                 .

              IndexFieldType -> (string)
                 The type of field. The valid options for a  field  depend  on

                     A value to use for the field if the field isn't specified
                     for a document.

                 SourceField -> (string)
                     A string that represents the  name  of  an  index  field.
                     CloudSearch  supports regular index fields as well as dy-
                     namic fields. A dynamic field's name  defines  a  pattern
                     that  begins or ends with a wildcard. Any document fields
                     that don't map to a regular index field but  do  match  a
                     dynamic  field's  pattern are configured with the dynamic
                     field's indexing options.

                     Regular field names begin with a letter and  can  contain
                     the  following  characters:  a-z  (lowercase), 0-9, and _
                     (underscore). Dynamic field names must begin or end  with

                     ter in a dynamic  field  name.  Multiple  wildcards,  and
                     wildcards embedded within a string are not supported.

                     The  name score is reserved and cannot be used as a field
                     name. To reference a document's ID, you can use the  name
                     _id .

                 FacetEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Whether facet information can be returned for the field.

                 Options for text field. Present if  IndexFieldType  specifies
                 the  field  is  of type text . A text field is always search-
                 able. All options are enabled by default.

                 DefaultValue -> (string)
                     A value to use for the field if the field isn't specified
                     for a document.

                 SourceField -> (string)
                     A  string  that  represents  the  name of an index field.
