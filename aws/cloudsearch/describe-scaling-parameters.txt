DESCRIBE-SCALING-PARAMETERS()                    DESCRIBE-SCALING-PARAMETERS()



NAME
       describe-scaling-parameters -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the scaling parameters configured for a domain. A domain's scaling
       parameters specify the desired search  instance  type  and  replication
       count.  For  more  information,  see Configuring Scaling Options in the
       Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-scaling-parameters
          --domain-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          A string that represents the name of  a  domain.  Domain  names  are
          unique  across the domains owned by an account within an AWS region.
          Domain names start with a letter or number and can contain the  fol-
          lowing characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ScalingParameters -> (structure)
          The status and configuration of a search  domain's  scaling  parame-
          ters.

          Options -> (structure)
              The desired instance type and desired number of replicas of each
              index partition.

              DesiredInstanceType -> (string)
                 The instance type that you want to preconfigure for your  do-
                 main. For example, search.m1.small .

              DesiredReplicationCount -> (integer)
                 The  number of replicas you want to preconfigure for each in-
                 dex partition.

              DesiredPartitionCount -> (integer)
                 The number of partitions you want to  preconfigure  for  your
                 domain.  Only valid when you select m2.2xlarge as the desired
                 instance type.

          Status -> (structure)
              The status of domain configuration option.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp for when this option was created.

              UpdateDate -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp for when this option was last updated.

              UpdateVersion -> (integer)
                 A unique integer that indicates when this option was last up-
                 dated.

              State -> (string)
                 The  state of processing a change to an option. Possible val-
                 ues:

                 o RequiresIndexDocuments : the option's latest value will not
                   be  deployed  until  IndexDocuments has been called and in-
                   dexing is complete.

                 o Processing : the option's latest value is in the process of
                   being activated.

                 o Active : the option's latest value is completely deployed.

                 o FailedToValidate  : the option value is not compatible with
                   the domain's data and cannot be used to index the data. You
                   must either modify the option value or update or remove the
                   incompatible documents.

              PendingDeletion -> (boolean)
                 Indicates that the option will be deleted once processing  is
                 complete.
