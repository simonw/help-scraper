       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-expression
          --domain-name <value>
          --expression-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          A  string  that  represents  the  name of a domain. Domain names are
          unique across the domains owned by an account within an AWS  region.
          Domain  names start with a letter or number and can contain the fol-
          lowing characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

       --expression-name (string)
          The name of the `` Expression`` to delete.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Expression -> (structure)
          The status of the expression being deleted.

          Options -> (structure)
              The  expression that is evaluated for sorting while processing a
              search request.

              ExpressionName -> (string)
                 Names must begin with a letter and can contain the  following
                 characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and _ (underscore).

              ExpressionValue -> (string)
                 The  expression  to  evaluate  for sorting while processing a
                 search request. The Expression syntax is based on  JavaScript
                 expressions.  For  more  information, see Configuring Expres-
                 sions in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide .

          Status -> (structure)
              The status of domain configuration option.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp for when this option was created.

              UpdateDate -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp for when this option was last updated.

              UpdateVersion -> (integer)
                 A unique integer that indicates when this option was last up-
                 dated.

              State -> (string)
                 The  state of processing a change to an option. Possible val-
                 ues:

                 o RequiresIndexDocuments : the option's latest value will not
                   be  deployed  until  IndexDocuments has been called and in-
                   dexing is complete.

                 o Processing : the option's latest value is in the process of
                   being activated.

                 o Active : the option's latest value is completely deployed.

                 o FailedToValidate  : the option value is not compatible with
                   the domain's data and cannot be used to index the data. You
                   must either modify the option value or update or remove the
                   incompatible documents.

              PendingDeletion -> (boolean)
                 Indicates that the option will be deleted once processing  is
                 complete.
