DELETE-DOMAIN()                                                DELETE-DOMAIN()



NAME
       delete-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       Permanently  deletes a search domain and all of its data. Once a domain
       has been deleted, it cannot be recovered.  For  more  information,  see
       Deleting a Search Domain in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-domain
          --domain-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The name of the domain you want to permanently delete.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DomainStatus -> (structure)
          The current status of the search domain.

          DomainId -> (string)
              An internally generated unique identifier for a domain.

          DomainName -> (string)
              A  string that represents the name of a domain. Domain names are
              unique across the domains owned by an account within an AWS  re-
              gion. Domain names start with a letter or number and can contain
              the following characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

          ARN -> (string)
              The Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the  search  domain.  See
              Identifiers  for  IAM  Entities in Using AWS Identity and Access
              Management for more information.

          Created -> (boolean)
              True if the search domain is created. It can take  several  min-
              utes  to initialize a domain when  CreateDomain is called. Newly
              created search domains are returned from  DescribeDomains with a
              false value for Created until domain creation is complete.

          Deleted -> (boolean)
              True  if  the  search  domain  has been deleted. The system must
              clean up resources dedicated to the search domain when   Delete-
              Domain is called. Newly deleted search domains are returned from
              DescribeDomains with a true value for IsDeleted for several min-
              utes until resource cleanup is complete.

          DocService -> (structure)
              The service endpoint for updating documents in a search domain.

              Endpoint -> (string)
                 The  endpoint to which service requests can be submitted. For
                 example,                            search-imdb-movies-oopcn-
                 jfn6ugofer3zx5iadxxca.eu-west-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com  or
                 doc-imdb-movies-oopcnjfn6ugofer3zx5iadxxca.eu-west-1.cloud-
                 search.amazonaws.com .

          SearchService -> (structure)
              The service endpoint for requesting search results from a search
              domain.

              Endpoint -> (string)
                 The endpoint to which service requests can be submitted.  For
                 example,                            search-imdb-movies-oopcn-
                 jfn6ugofer3zx5iadxxca.eu-west-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com  or
                 doc-imdb-movies-oopcnjfn6ugofer3zx5iadxxca.eu-west-1.cloud-
                 search.amazonaws.com .

          RequiresIndexDocuments -> (boolean)
              True if  IndexDocuments needs to be called to activate the  cur-
              rent domain configuration.

          Processing -> (boolean)
              True  if processing is being done to activate the current domain
              configuration.

          SearchInstanceType -> (string)
              The instance type that is being used to process search requests.

          SearchPartitionCount -> (integer)
              The number of  partitions  across  which  the  search  index  is
              spread.

          SearchInstanceCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of  search  instances that are available to process
              search requests.

          Limits -> (structure)
              MaximumReplicationCount -> (integer)

              MaximumPartitionCount -> (integer)
