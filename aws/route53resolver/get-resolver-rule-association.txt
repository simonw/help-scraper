GET-RESOLVER-RULE-ASSOCIATION()                GET-RESOLVER-RULE-ASSOCIATION()



NAME
       get-resolver-rule-association -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about an association between a specified Resolver rule
       and  a  VPC.  You  associate  a  Resolver  rule   and   a   VPC   using
       AssociateResolverRule .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-resolver-rule-association
          --resolver-rule-association-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resolver-rule-association-id (string)
          The  ID of the Resolver rule association that you want to get infor-
          mation about.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about the association between a Resolver rule and  a
       VPC

       The  following  get-resolver-rule-association  example displays details
       about the association between a specified Resolver rule and a VPC.  You
       associate a resolver rule and a VPC using associate-resolver-rule.

          aws route53resolver get-resolver-rule-association \
              --resolver-rule-association-id rslvr-rrassoc-d61cbb2c8bexample

       Output:

          {
              "ResolverRuleAssociation": {
                  "Id": "rslvr-rrassoc-d61cbb2c8bexample",
                  "ResolverRuleId": "rslvr-rr-42b60677c0example",
                  "Name": "my-resolver-rule-association",
                  "VPCId": "vpc-304bexam",
                  "Status": "COMPLETE",
                  "StatusMessage": ""
              }
          }

              AssociateResolverRule request.

          ResolverRuleId -> (string)
              The ID of the Resolver rule that you  associated  with  the  VPC
              that is specified by VPCId .

          Name -> (string)
              The name of an association between a Resolver rule and a VPC.

          VPCId -> (string)
              The ID of the VPC that you associated the Resolver rule with.

          Status -> (string)
              A  code that specifies the current status of the association be-
              tween a Resolver rule and a VPC.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              A detailed description of the status of the association  between
              a Resolver rule and a VPC.
