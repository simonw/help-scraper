NAME
       create-firewall-domain-list -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  empty  firewall domain list for use in DNS Firewall rules.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-firewall-domain-list
          [--creator-request-id <value>]
          --name <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --creator-request-id (string)
          A unique string that identifies the request and that allows  you  to
          retry  failed  requests  without  the  risk of running the operation
          twice. CreatorRequestId can be any unique  string,  for  example,  a
          date/time stamp.

       --name (string)
          A name that lets you identify the domain list to manage and use it.

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  the tag keys and values that you want to associate with
          the domain list.

          (structure)
              One tag that you want to add to the specified  resource.  A  tag
              consists of a Key (a name for the tag) and a Value .

              Key -> (string)
                 The  name  for the tag. For example, if you want to associate
                 Resolver resources with the account IDs of your customers for
                 billing purposes, the value of Key might be account-id .

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value  for  the tag. For example, if Key is account-id ,
                 then Value might be the  ID  of  the  customer  account  that
                 you're creating the resource for.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall domain list

       The following create-firewall-domain-list example creates  a  Route  53
       Resolver DNS Firewall domain list, named test, in your AWS account.

          aws route53resolver create-firewall-domain-list \
              --creator-request-id my-request-id \
              --name test

       Output:

          {
              "FirewallDomainList": {
                  "Id": "rslvr-fdl-d61cbb2cbexample",
                  "Arn": "arn:aws:route53resolver:us-west-2:123456789012:firewall-domain-list/rslvr-fdl-d61cbb2cbexample",
                  "Name": "test",
                  "DomainCount": 0,
                  "Status": "COMPLETE",
                  "StatusMessage": "Created Firewall Domain List",
                  "CreatorRequestId": "my-request-id",
                  "CreationTime": "2021-05-25T15:55:51.115365Z",
                  "ModificationTime": "2021-05-25T15:55:51.115365Z"
              }
          }

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A unique string defined by you to identify the request. This al-
