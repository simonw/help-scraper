UPDATE-FIREWALL-RULE-GROUP-ASSOCIATIONUPDATE-FIREWALL-RULE-GROUP-ASSOCIATION()



NAME
       update-firewall-rule-group-association -

DESCRIPTION
       Changes the association of a  FirewallRuleGroup with a VPC. The associ-
       ation enables DNS filtering for the VPC.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-firewall-rule-group-association
          --firewall-rule-group-association-id <value>
          [--priority <value>]
          [--mutation-protection <value>]
          [--name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --firewall-rule-group-association-id (string)
          The identifier of the  FirewallRuleGroupAssociation .

       --priority (integer)
          The setting that determines the processing order of the  rule  group
          among the rule groups that you associate with the specified VPC. DNS
          Firewall filters VPC traffic starting from the rule group  with  the
          lowest numeric priority setting.

          You  must specify a unique priority for each rule group that you as-
          sociate with a single VPC. To make it easier to insert  rule  groups
          later,  leave  space between the numbers, for example, use 100, 200,
          and so on. You can change the priority setting for a rule group  as-
          sociation after you create it.

       --mutation-protection (string)
          If  enabled,  this  setting disallows modification or removal of the
          association, to help prevent against accidentally altering DNS fire-
          wall protections.

          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

          o DISABLED

       --name (string)
          The name of the rule group association.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a firewall rule group association

       The  following update-firewall-rule-group-association example updates a
       firewall rule group association.

          aws route53resolver update-firewall-rule-group-association \
              --firewall-rule-group-association-id rslvr-frgassoc-57e8873d7example \
              --priority 103

       Output:

          {
              "FirewallRuleGroupAssociation": {
                  "Id": "rslvr-frgassoc-57e8873d7example",
                  "Arn": "arn:aws:route53resolver:us-west-2:123456789012:firewall-rule-group-association/rslvr-frgassoc-57e8873d7example",
                  "FirewallRuleGroupId": "rslvr-frg-47f93271fexample",
                  "VpcId": "vpc-31e92222",
                  "Name": "test-association",
                  "Priority": 103,
                  "MutationProtection": "DISABLED",
                  "Status": "UPDATING",
                  "StatusMessage": "Updating the Firewall Rule Group Association Attributes",
                  "CreatorRequestId": "2ca1a304-32b3-4f5f-bc4c-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "CreationTime": "2021-05-25T21:47:48.755768Z",
                  "ModificationTime": "2021-05-25T21:50:09.272569Z"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       FirewallRuleGroupAssociation -> (structure)
          The association that you just updated.

          Id -> (string)
              The identifier for the association.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall rule group  asso-
              ciation.

          FirewallRuleGroupId -> (string)
              The unique identifier of the firewall rule group.

          VpcId -> (string)
              The  unique  identifier  of  the VPC that is associated with the
              rule group.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the association.

          Priority -> (integer)
              The setting that determines the processing  order  of  the  rule
              group  among  the  rule groups that are associated with a single
              VPC. DNS Firewall filters VPC traffic starting from  rule  group
              with the lowest numeric priority setting.

          MutationProtection -> (string)
              If  enabled,  this  setting disallows modification or removal of
              the association, to help prevent against  accidentally  altering
              DNS firewall protections.

          ManagedOwnerName -> (string)
              The  owner  of  the association, used only for associations that
              are not managed by you. If you use Firewall  Manager  to  manage
              your  DNS  Firewalls,  then this reports Firewall Manager as the
              managed owner.

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of the association.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              Additional information about the  status  of  the  response,  if
              available.

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A unique string defined by you to identify the request. This al-
              lows you to retry failed requests without the  risk  of  running
              the operation twice. This can be any unique string, for example,
              a timestamp.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The date and time that the association was created, in Unix time
              format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          ModificationTime -> (string)
              The  date  and  time  that the association was last modified, in
              Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
