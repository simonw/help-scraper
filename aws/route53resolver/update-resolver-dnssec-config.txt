NAME
       update-resolver-dnssec-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates an existing DNSSEC validation configuration. If there is no ex-
       isting DNSSEC validation configuration, one is created.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-resolver-dnssec-config
          --resource-id <value>
          --validation <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-id (string)
          The ID of the virtual private cloud (VPC) that you're  updating  the
          DNSSEC validation status for.

       --validation (string)
          The  new value that you are specifying for DNSSEC validation for the
          VPC. The value can be ENABLE or DISABLE . Be aware that it can  take
          time for a validation status change to be completed.

          Possible values:

          o ENABLE

          o DISABLE

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ResolverDNSSECConfig -> (structure)
          A  complex type that contains settings for the specified DNSSEC con-
          figuration.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID for a configuration for DNSSEC validation.

          OwnerId -> (string)
              The owner account ID of the virtual private cloud  (VPC)  for  a
              configuration for DNSSEC validation.

          ResourceId -> (string)
              The  ID of the virtual private cloud (VPC) that you're configur-
              ing the DNSSEC validation status for.

          ValidationStatus -> (string)
              The validation status for a DNSSEC configuration. The status can
              be one of the following:

              o ENABLING:  DNSSEC  validation is being enabled but is not com-
                plete.

              o ENABLED: DNSSEC validation is enabled.

              o DISABLING: DNSSEC validation is being disabled but is not com-
                plete.

              o DISABLED DNSSEC validation is disabled.
