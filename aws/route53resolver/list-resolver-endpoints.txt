LIST-RESOLVER-ENDPOINTS()                            LIST-RESOLVER-ENDPOINTS()



NAME
       list-resolver-endpoints -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  the  Resolver endpoints that were created using the current
       Amazon Web Services account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-resolver-endpoints is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: ResolverEndpoints

SYNOPSIS
            list-resolver-endpoints
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An  optional specification to return a subset of Resolver endpoints,
          such as all inbound Resolver endpoints.

          NOTE:
              If you submit a second or subsequent  ListResolverEndpoints  re-
              quest and specify the NextToken parameter, you must use the same
              values for Filters , if any, as in the previous request.

          (structure)
              For   Resolver   list   operations   (ListResolverEndpoints    ,
              ListResolverRules      ,      ListResolverRuleAssociations     ,
              ListResolverQueryLogConfigs                                    ,
              ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations           ),          and
              ListResolverDnssecConfigs ), an optional specification to return
              a subset of objects.

              To filter objects, such as Resolver endpoints or Resolver rules,
              you specify Name and Values . For example, to list only  inbound
              Resolver  endpoints,  specify Direction for Name and specify IN-
              BOUND for Values .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the parameter that you want to use to filter  ob-
                 jects.

                 The  valid  values  for Name depend on the action that you're
                 including   the   filter    in,    ListResolverEndpoints    ,
                 ListResolverRules     ,     ListResolverRuleAssociations    ,
                 ListResolverQueryLogConfigs               ,                or
                 ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations .

                 NOTE:
                        In  early  versions  of Resolver, values for Name were
                        listed as uppercase, with underscore  (_)  delimiters.
                        For example, CreatorRequestId was originally listed as
                        CREATOR_REQUEST_ID . Uppercase  values  for  Name  are
                        still supported.

                     ListResolverEndpoints

                 Valid values for Name include the following:

                 o CreatorRequestId  :  The  value that you specified when you
                   created the Resolver endpoint.

                 o Direction : Whether you want to return inbound or  outbound
                   Resolver  endpoints.  If  you  specify DIRECTION for Name ,
                   specify INBOUND or OUTBOUND for Values .

                 o HostVPCId : The ID of the VPC that inbound DNS queries pass
                   through  on the way from your network to your VPCs in a re-
                   gion, or the VPC that outbound queries pass through on  the
                   way    from    your    VPCs   to   your   network.   In   a
                   CreateResolverEndpoint request, SubnetId indirectly identi-
                   fies  the VPC. In a GetResolverEndpoint request, the VPC ID
                   for a Resolver endpoint is returned in the  HostVPCId  ele-
                   ment.

                 o IpAddressCount  :  The number of IP addresses that you have
                   associated with the Resolver endpoint.

                 o Name : The name of the Resolver endpoint.

                 o SecurityGroupIds : The IDs of the VPC security groups  that
                   you specified when you created the Resolver endpoint.

                 o Status  : The status of the Resolver endpoint. If you spec-
                   ify Status for Name , specify one of the  following  status
                   codes  for  Values  :  CREATING  , OPERATIONAL , UPDATING ,
                   AUTO_RECOVERING , ACTION_NEEDED , or DELETING  .  For  more
                   information, see Status in ResolverEndpoint .
                     ListResolverRules

                 Valid values for Name include the following:

                 o CreatorRequestId  :  The  value that you specified when you
                   created the Resolver rule.

                 o DomainName : The domain name for which Resolver is forward-
                   ing  DNS  queries  to  your  network. In the value that you
                   specify for Values , include a trailing dot (.)  after  the
                   domain  name.  For  example,  if  the  domain name is exam-
                   ple.com, specify the following value. Note  the  "."  after
                   com :  example.com.

                 o Name : The name of the Resolver rule.

                 o ResolverEndpointId  :  The ID of the Resolver endpoint that
                   the Resolver rule is associated with.

                 NOTE:
                     You can filter on the Resolver endpoint  only  for  rules
                     that have a value of FORWARD for RuleType .

                 o Status  :  The  status of the Resolver rule. If you specify
                   Status for Name , specify one of the following status codes
                   for Values : COMPLETE , DELETING , UPDATING , or FAILED .

                 o Type  :  The type of the Resolver rule. If you specify TYPE
                   for Name , specify FORWARD or SYSTEM for Values .

                   . For more information, see Status .

              Values -> (list)
                 When you're using a List operation and you want the operation
                 to  return a subset of objects, such as Resolver endpoints or
                 Resolver rules, the value of the parameter that you  want  to
                 use  to filter objects. For example, to list only inbound Re-
                 solver endpoints, specify Direction for Name and specify  IN-
                 BOUND for Values .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If more than MaxResults IP addresses match the  specified  criteria,
          you  can submit another ListResolverEndpoint request to get the next
          group of results. In the next request, specify the value of  NextTo-
          ken from the previous response.

       MaxResults -> (integer)
          The value that you specified for MaxResults in the request.

       ResolverEndpoints -> (list)
          The Resolver endpoints that were created by using the current Amazon
          Web Services account, and that match the specified filters, if any.

              In    the    response    to    a    CreateResolverEndpoint     ,
              DeleteResolverEndpoint       ,       GetResolverEndpoint       ,
              ListResolverEndpoints ,  or  UpdateResolverEndpoint  request,  a
              complex  type  that contains settings for an existing inbound or
              outbound Resolver endpoint.

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID of the Resolver endpoint.

              CreatorRequestId -> (string)
                 A unique string that identifies the request that created  the
                 Resolver  endpoint.  The  CreatorRequestId  allows failed re-
                 quests to be retried without the risk of running  the  opera-
                 tion twice.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the Resolver endpoint.

              Name -> (string)

                 this VPC. The security group must include one or more inbound
                 rules (for inbound endpoints) or outbound rules (for outbound
                 endpoints). Inbound and outbound rules must allow TCP and UDP
                 access. For inbound access, open port 53.  For  outbound  ac-
                 cess, open the port that you're using for DNS queries on your
                 network.

              Direction -> (string)
                 Indicates whether the Resolver  endpoint  allows  inbound  or
                 outbound DNS queries:

                 o INBOUND : allows DNS queries to your VPC from your network

                 o OUTBOUND : allows DNS queries from your VPC to your network

              IpAddressCount -> (integer)
                 The number of IP addresses that the Resolver endpoint can use
                 for DNS queries.

              HostVPCId -> (string)
                 The ID of the VPC that you want to create the  Resolver  end-
                 point in.

              Status -> (string)
                 A code that specifies the current status of the Resolver end-
                 point. Valid values include the following:

                 o CREATING : Resolver is creating and configuring one or more
                   Amazon VPC network interfaces for this endpoint.

                 o OPERATIONAL  :  The  Amazon VPC network interfaces for this
                   endpoint are correctly configured and able to pass  inbound
                   or outbound DNS queries between your network and Resolver.

                 o UPDATING : Resolver is associating or disassociating one or
                   more network interfaces with this endpoint.

                 o AUTO_RECOVERING : Resolver is trying to recover one or more
                   of  the  network  interfaces  that are associated with this
                   endpoint. During the recovery process, the  endpoint  func-
                   tions  with  limited  capacity  because of the limit on the
                   number of DNS queries per IP address  (per  network  inter-
                   face).  For  the  current limit, see Limits on Route 53 Re-
                   solver .

                 o ACTION_NEEDED : This endpoint is  unhealthy,  and  Resolver
                   can't  automatically recover it. To resolve the problem, we
                   recommend that you check each IP address that  you  associ-
                   ated  with  the  endpoint.  For  each IP address that isn't
                   available, add another IP address and then  delete  the  IP
                   address  that isn't available. (An endpoint must always in-
                   clude at least two IP addresses.) A status of ACTION_NEEDED
                   can have a variety of causes. Here are two common causes:

                   o One or more of the network interfaces that are associated
                     with the endpoint were deleted using Amazon VPC.

                   o The network interface couldn't be created for some reason
                     that's outside the control of Resolver.

                 o DELETING : Resolver is deleting this endpoint and the asso-
                   ciated network interfaces.

              StatusMessage -> (string)
                 A detailed description of the status  of  the  Resolver  end-
                 point.

              CreationTime -> (string)
                 The date and time that the endpoint was created, in Unix time
                 format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

              ModificationTime -> (string)
                 The date and time that the endpoint  was  last  modified,  in
                 Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
