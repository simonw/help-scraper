NAME
       disassociate-firewall-rule-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Disassociates  a  FirewallRuleGroup from a VPC, to remove DNS filtering
       from the VPC.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-firewall-rule-group
          --firewall-rule-group-association-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --firewall-rule-group-association-id (string)
          The identifier of the  FirewallRuleGroupAssociation .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To disassociate a firewall rule group from a VPC

       The following disassociate-firewall-rule-group example disassociates  a
       DNS Firewall rule group from an Amazon VPC.

          aws route53resolver disassociate-firewall-rule-group \
              --firewall-rule-group-association-id rslvr-frgassoc-57e8873d7example

       Output:

          {
              "FirewallRuleGroupAssociation": {
                  "Id": "rslvr-frgassoc-57e8873d7example",
                  "Arn": "arn:aws:route53resolver:us-west-2:123456789012:firewall-rule-group-association/rslvr-frgassoc-57e8873d7example",
                  "FirewallRuleGroupId": "rslvr-frg-47f93271fexample",
                  "VpcId": "vpc-31e92222",
                  "Name": "test-association",
                  "Priority": 103,
                  "MutationProtection": "DISABLED",
                  "Status": "DELETING",
                  "StatusMessage": "Deleting the Firewall Rule Group Association",
                  "CreatorRequestId": "2ca1a304-32b3-4f5f-bc4c-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "CreationTime": "2021-05-25T21:47:48.755768Z",

              }
          }

OUTPUT
       FirewallRuleGroupAssociation -> (structure)
          The firewall rule group association that you just removed.

          Id -> (string)
              The identifier for the association.

          Arn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall rule group asso-
              ciation.

          FirewallRuleGroupId -> (string)
              The unique identifier of the firewall rule group.

          VpcId -> (string)
              The unique identifier of the VPC that  is  associated  with  the
              rule group.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the association.

          Priority -> (integer)
              The  setting  that  determines  the processing order of the rule
              group among the rule groups that are associated  with  a  single
              VPC.  DNS  Firewall filters VPC traffic starting from rule group
              with the lowest numeric priority setting.

          MutationProtection -> (string)
              If enabled, this setting disallows modification  or  removal  of
              the  association,  to help prevent against accidentally altering
              DNS firewall protections.

          ManagedOwnerName -> (string)
              The owner of the association, used only  for  associations  that
              are  not  managed  by you. If you use Firewall Manager to manage
              your DNS Firewalls, then this reports Firewall  Manager  as  the
              managed owner.

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of the association.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              Additional  information  about  the  status  of the response, if
              available.

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A unique string defined by you to identify the request. This al-
              lows  you  to  retry failed requests without the risk of running
              the operation twice. This can be any unique string, for example,
              a timestamp.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The date and time that the association was created, in Unix time
              format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          ModificationTime -> (string)
              The date and time that the association  was  last  modified,  in
              Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
