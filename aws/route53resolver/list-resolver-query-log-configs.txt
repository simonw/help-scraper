NAME
       list-resolver-query-log-configs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  information  about  the  specified query logging configurations.
       Each configuration defines where you want Resolver to  save  DNS  query
       logs and specifies the VPCs that you want to log queries for.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-resolver-query-log-configs  is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: ResolverQueryLogConfigs

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An optional specification to return a subset of query  logging  con-
          figurations.

          NOTE:
              If you submit a second or subsequent ListResolverQueryLogConfigs
              request and specify the NextToken parameter, you  must  use  the
              same values for Filters , if any, as in the previous request.

          (structure)
              For    Resolver   list   operations   (ListResolverEndpoints   ,
              ListResolverRules     ,      ListResolverRuleAssociations      ,
              ListResolverQueryLogConfigs                                    ,
              ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations          ),           and
              ListResolverDnssecConfigs ), an optional specification to return
              a subset of objects.

              To filter objects, such as Resolver endpoints or Resolver rules,
              you  specify Name and Values . For example, to list only inbound
              Resolver endpoints, specify Direction for Name and  specify  IN-
              BOUND for Values .

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name of the parameter that you want to use to filter ob-
                 jects.

                 The valid values for Name depend on the  action  that  you're
                 including    the    filter    in,   ListResolverEndpoints   ,
                 ListResolverRules    ,     ListResolverRuleAssociations     ,
                 ListResolverQueryLogConfigs                ,               or
                 ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations .

                 NOTE:
                        In early versions of Resolver, values  for  Name  were
                        listed  as  uppercase, with underscore (_) delimiters.
                        For example, CreatorRequestId was originally listed as
                        CREATOR_REQUEST_ID  .  Uppercase  values  for Name are
                        still supported.

                     ListResolverEndpoints

                 Valid values for Name include the following:

                 o CreatorRequestId : The value that you  specified  when  you
                   created the Resolver endpoint.

                 o Direction  : Whether you want to return inbound or outbound
                   Resolver endpoints. If you specify  DIRECTION  for  Name  ,
                   specify INBOUND or OUTBOUND for Values .

                 o HostVPCId : The ID of the VPC that inbound DNS queries pass
                   through on the way from your network to your VPCs in a  re-
                   gion,  or the VPC that outbound queries pass through on the
                   way   from   your   VPCs   to   your    network.    In    a
                   CreateResolverEndpoint request, SubnetId indirectly identi-
                   fies the VPC. In a GetResolverEndpoint request, the VPC  ID
                   for  a  Resolver endpoint is returned in the HostVPCId ele-
                   ment.

                 o IpAddressCount : The number of IP addresses that  you  have
                   associated with the Resolver endpoint.

                 o Name : The name of the Resolver endpoint.

                 o SecurityGroupIds  : The IDs of the VPC security groups that
                   you specified when you created the Resolver endpoint.

                 o Status : The status of the Resolver endpoint. If you  spec-
                   ify  Status  for Name , specify one of the following status
                   codes for Values : CREATING  ,  OPERATIONAL  ,  UPDATING  ,
                   AUTO_RECOVERING  ,  ACTION_NEEDED  , or DELETING . For more
                   information, see Status in ResolverEndpoint .
                     ListResolverRules

                 Valid values for Name include the following:

                 o CreatorRequestId : The value that you  specified  when  you
                   created the Resolver rule.

                 o DomainName : The domain name for which Resolver is forward-
                   ing DNS queries to your network.  In  the  value  that  you
                   specify  for  Values , include a trailing dot (.) after the
                   domain name. For example,  if  the  domain  name  is  exam-
                   ple.com,  specify  the  following value. Note the "." after
                   com :  example.com.

                 o ResolverEndpointId : The ID of the Resolver  endpoint  that
                   the Resolver rule is associated with.

                 NOTE:
                     You  can  filter  on the Resolver endpoint only for rules
                     that have a value of FORWARD for RuleType .

                 o Status : The status of the Resolver rule.  If  you  specify
                   Status for Name , specify one of the following status codes
                   for Values : COMPLETE , DELETING , UPDATING , or FAILED .

              Values -> (list)
                 When you're using a List operation and you want the operation
                 to return a subset of objects, such as Resolver endpoints  or
                 Resolver  rules,  the value of the parameter that you want to
                 use to filter objects. For example, to list only inbound  Re-
                 solver  endpoints, specify Direction for Name and specify IN-
                 BOUND for Values .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --sort-by (string)
          The element that you want Resolver to sort query logging  configura-
          tions by.

          NOTE:
              If you submit a second or subsequent ListResolverQueryLogConfigs
              request and specify the NextToken parameter, you  must  use  the
              same value for SortBy , if any, as in the previous request.

          Valid values include the following elements:

          o Arn : The ARN of the query logging configuration

            zon Web Services accounts or shared with the  current  account  by
            another Amazon Web Services account. Sharing is configured through
            Resource Access Manager (RAM).

          o Status : The current status of the configuration. Valid values in-
            clude the following:

            o CREATING : Resolver is creating the query logging configuration.

            o CREATED  : The query logging configuration was successfully cre-
              ated. Resolver is logging queries that originate in  the  speci-
              fied VPC.

            o DELETING  :  Resolver  is deleting this query logging configura-
              tion.

            o FAILED : Resolver either couldn't create or couldn't delete  the
              query logging configuration. Here are two common causes:

              o The  specified  destination (for example, an Amazon S3 bucket)
                was deleted.

              o Permissions don't allow sending logs to the destination.

       --sort-order (string)
          If you specified a value for SortBy , the order that you want  query
          logging configurations to be listed in, ASCENDING or DESCENDING .

          NOTE:
              If you submit a second or subsequent ListResolverQueryLogConfigs
              request and specify the NextToken parameter, you  must  use  the
              same value for SortOrder , if any, as in the previous request.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If there are more than MaxResults query logging configurations,  you
          can  submit  another  ListResolverQueryLogConfigs request to get the
          next group of configurations. In the next request, specify the value
          of NextToken from the previous response.

       TotalCount -> (integer)
          The  total  number of query logging configurations that were created
          by the current account in the specified Region. This count can  dif-
          fer  from  the  number  of query logging configurations that are re-
          turned in a ListResolverQueryLogConfigs response, depending  on  the
          values that you specify in the request.

       TotalFilteredCount -> (integer)
          The  total  number of query logging configurations that were created
          by the current account in the specified Region and  that  match  the
          filters  that  were specified in the ListResolverQueryLogConfigs re-
          quest. For the total number of  query  logging  configurations  that
          were created by the current account in the specified Region, see To-
          talCount .

       ResolverQueryLogConfigs -> (list)
          A list that contains one  ResolverQueryLogConfig  element  for  each
          query  logging configuration that matches the values that you speci-
          fied for Filter .

          (structure)
              In   the   response   to   a   CreateResolverQueryLogConfig    ,
              DeleteResolverQueryLogConfig  ,  GetResolverQueryLogConfig  , or
              ListResolverQueryLogConfigs request, a complex  type  that  con-
              tains settings for one query logging configuration.

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID for the query logging configuration.

              OwnerId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Web Services account ID for the account that cre-
                 ated the query logging configuration.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of  the  specified  query  logging  configuration.
                 Valid values include the following:

                 o CREATING  : Resolver is creating the query logging configu-
                   ration.

                 o CREATED : The query logging configuration was  successfully
                   created.  Resolver is logging queries that originate in the
                   specified VPC.

                 o DELETING : Resolver is deleting this query logging configu-
                   ration.

                 o FAILED  :  Resolver can't deliver logs to the location that
                   is specified in the query logging configuration.  Here  are
                   two common causes:

                   o The  specified  destination  (for  example,  an Amazon S3
                     bucket) was deleted.

                   o Permissions don't allow sending logs to the destination.

              ShareStatus -> (string)
                 An indication of whether the query logging  configuration  is
                 shared with other Amazon Web Services accounts, or was shared
                 with the current account by another Amazon Web  Services  ac-
                 count.  Sharing is configured through Resource Access Manager
                 (RAM).

              AssociationCount -> (integer)
                 The number of VPCs that are associated with the query logging
                 configuration.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The ARN for the query logging configuration.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the query logging configuration.

              DestinationArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN of the resource that you want Resolver to send query
                 logs: an Amazon S3 bucket, a CloudWatch Logs log group, or  a
                 Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream.

              CreatorRequestId -> (string)
                 A  unique string that identifies the request that created the
                 query  logging  configuration.  The  CreatorRequestId  allows
                 failed requests to be retried without the risk of running the
                 operation twice.

              CreationTime -> (string)
                 The date and time that the query  logging  configuration  was
                 created,  in  Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time
                 (UTC).
