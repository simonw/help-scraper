LIST-FIREWALL-RULE-GROUPS()                        LIST-FIREWALL-RULE-GROUPS()



NAME
       list-firewall-rule-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  minimal high-level information for the rule groups that
       you have defined.

       A single call might return only a partial list of the rule groups.  For
       information, see MaxResults .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-firewall-rule-groups  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: FirewallRuleGroups

SYNOPSIS
            list-firewall-rule-groups
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a list of your Firewall rule groups

       The following list-firewall-rule-groups example lists your DNS Firewall
       rule groups.

          aws route53resolver list-firewall-rule-groups

       Output:

          {
              "FirewallRuleGroups": [
                  {
                      "Id": "rslvr-frg-47f93271fexample",
                      "Arn": "arn:aws:route53resolver:us-west-2:123456789012:firewall-rule-group/rslvr-frg-47f93271fexample",
                      "Name": "test",
                      "OwnerId": "123456789012",
                      "CreatorRequestId": "my-request-id",
                      "ShareStatus": "NOT_SHARED"
                  }
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Managing rule groups and rules in  DNS  Fire-
       wall in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If  objects are still available for retrieval, Resolver returns this
          token in the response. To retrieve the next batch of  objects,  pro-
          vide this token in your next request.

       FirewallRuleGroups -> (list)
          A list of your firewall rule groups.

          This  might  be  a partial list of the rule groups that you have de-
          fined. For information, see MaxResults .

          (structure)
              Minimal high-level information for a firewall  rule  group.  The
              action   ListFirewallRuleGroups  returns  an  array of these ob-
              jects.

              To retrieve full information for a  firewall  rule  group,  call
              GetFirewallRuleGroup and  ListFirewallRules .

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID of the rule group.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the rule group.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the rule group.

              OwnerId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Web Services account ID for the account that cre-
                 ated the rule group. When a rule group is  shared  with  your
                 account,  this  is the account that has shared the rule group
                 with you.

              CreatorRequestId -> (string)
                 A unique string defined by you to identify the request.  This
                 allows  you to retry failed requests without the risk of run-
                 ning the operation twice. This can be any unique string,  for
                 example, a timestamp.

              ShareStatus -> (string)
                 Whether  the  rule group is shared with other Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices accounts, or was shared with the current account by an-
                 other  Amazon  Web  Services  account.  Sharing is configured
                 through Resource Access Manager (RAM).
