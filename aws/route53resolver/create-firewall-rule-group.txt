CREATE-FIREWALL-RULE-GROUP()                      CREATE-FIREWALL-RULE-GROUP()



NAME
       create-firewall-rule-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  empty  DNS  Firewall  rule group for filtering DNS network
       traffic in a VPC. You can add rules to the new rule  group  by  calling
       CreateFirewallRule .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-firewall-rule-group
          [--creator-request-id <value>]
          --name <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --creator-request-id (string)
          A  unique string defined by you to identify the request. This allows
          you to retry failed requests without the risk of running the  opera-
          tion twice. This can be any unique string, for example, a timestamp.

       --name (string)
          A name that lets you identify the rule group, to manage and use it.

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  the tag keys and values that you want to associate with
          the rule group.

          (structure)
              One tag that you want to add to the specified  resource.  A  tag
              consists of a Key (a name for the tag) and a Value .

              Key -> (string)
                 The  name  for the tag. For example, if you want to associate
                 Resolver resources with the account IDs of your customers for
                 billing purposes, the value of Key might be account-id .

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value  for  the tag. For example, if Key is account-id ,
                 then Value might be the  ID  of  the  customer  account  that
                 you're creating the resource for.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a Firewall rule group

       The following create-firewall-rule-group example creates a DNS Firewall
       rule group.

          aws route53resolver create-firewall-rule-group \
              --creator-request-id my-request-id \
              --name test

       Output:

          {
              "FirewallRuleGroup": {
                  "Id": "rslvr-frg-47f93271fexample",
                  "Arn": "arn:aws:route53resolver:us-west-2:123456789012:firewall-rule-group/rslvr-frg-47f93271fexample",
                  "Name": "test",
                  "RuleCount": 0,
                  "Status": "COMPLETE",
                  "StatusMessage": "Created Firewall Rule Group",
                  "OwnerId": "123456789012",
                  "CreatorRequestId": "my-request-id",
                  "ShareStatus": "NOT_SHARED",
                  "CreationTime": "2021-05-25T18:59:26.490017Z",
                  "ModificationTime": "2021-05-25T18:59:26.490017Z"
              }
          }
