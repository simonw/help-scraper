LIST-FIREWALL-DOMAIN-LISTS()                      LIST-FIREWALL-DOMAIN-LISTS()



NAME
       list-firewall-domain-lists -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  firewall  domain  lists that you have defined. For each
       firewall domain list, you can retrieve the domains that are defined for
       a list by calling  ListFirewallDomains .

       A  single  call to this list operation might return only a partial list
       of the domain lists. For information, see MaxResults .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-firewall-domain-lists is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: FirewallDomainLists

SYNOPSIS
            list-firewall-domain-lists
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If objects are still available for retrieval, Resolver returns  this
          token  in  the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, pro-
          vide this token in your next request.

       FirewallDomainLists -> (list)
          A list of the domain lists that you have defined.

          This might be a partial list of the domain  lists  that  you've  de-
          fined. For information, see MaxResults .

          (structure)
              Minimal  high-level  information for a firewall domain list. The
              action  ListFirewallDomainLists returns an array  of  these  ob-
              jects.

              To  retrieve  full  information for a firewall domain list, call
              GetFirewallDomainList and  ListFirewallDomains .

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID of the domain list.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  firewall  domain  list
                 metadata.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the domain list.

              CreatorRequestId -> (string)
                 A  unique string defined by you to identify the request. This
                 allows you to retry failed requests without the risk of  run-
                 ning  the operation twice. This can be any unique string, for
                 example, a timestamp.

              ManagedOwnerName -> (string)
                 The owner of the list, used only for lists that are not  man-
                 aged by you. For example, the managed domain list AWSManaged-
                 DomainsMalwareDomainList has the managed owner name Route  53
                 Resolver DNS Firewall .
