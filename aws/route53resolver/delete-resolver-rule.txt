DELETE-RESOLVER-RULE()                                  DELETE-RESOLVER-RULE()



NAME
       delete-resolver-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  Resolver  rule.  Before you can delete a Resolver rule, you
       must disassociate it from all the VPCs that you associated the Resolver
       rule with. For more information, see DisassociateResolverRule .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-resolver-rule
          --resolver-rule-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resolver-rule-id (string)
          The ID of the Resolver rule that you want to delete.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete a Resolver rule

       The following delete-resolver-rule example deletes the specified rule.

       Note If a rule is associated with any VPCs, you must first disassociate
       the rule from the VPCs before you can delete it.

          aws route53resolver delete-resolver-rule \
              --resolver-rule-id rslvr-rr-5b3809426bexample

OUTPUT
       ResolverRule -> (structure)
          Information about the DeleteResolverRule request, including the sta-
          tus of the request.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID that Resolver assigned to the Resolver rule when you cre-
              ated it.

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A unique string that you specified when you created the Resolver
              rule.  CreatorRequestId identifies the request and allows failed
              requests to be retried without the risk of running the operation
              twice.

          Arn -> (string)
              The  ARN  (Amazon Resource Name) for the Resolver rule specified
              by Id .

          DomainName -> (string)
              DNS queries for this domain name are forwarded  to  the  IP  ad-
              dresses  that  are  specified  in TargetIps . If a query matches
              multiple Resolver rules (example.com and  www.example.com),  the
              query  is  routed using the Resolver rule that contains the most
              specific domain name (www.example.com).

          Status -> (string)
              A code that specifies the current status of the Resolver rule.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              A detailed description of the status of a Resolver rule.

          RuleType -> (string)
              When you want to forward DNS queries for specified  domain  name
              to resolvers on your network, specify FORWARD .

              When you have a forwarding rule to forward DNS queries for a do-
              main to your network and you want Resolver  to  process  queries
              for a subdomain of that domain, specify SYSTEM .

              For example, to forward DNS queries for example.com to resolvers
              on your network, you create a rule and specify FORWARD for Rule-
              Type  .  To  then  have  Resolver process queries for apex.exam-
              ple.com, you create a rule and specify SYSTEM for RuleType .

              Currently, only Resolver can create rules that have a  value  of
              RECURSIVE for RuleType .

          Name -> (string)
              The  name  for  the  Resolver rule, which you specified when you
              created the Resolver rule.

          TargetIps -> (list)
              An array that contains the IP addresses and ports that  an  out-
              bound endpoint forwards DNS queries to. Typically, these are the
              IP addresses of DNS resolvers on your network. Specify IPv4  ad-
              dresses. IPv6 is not supported.

              (structure)
                 In a CreateResolverRule request, an array of the IPs that you
                 want to forward DNS queries to.

                 Ip -> (string)
                     One IP address that you want to forward DNS  queries  to.
                     You can specify only IPv4 addresses.

                 Port -> (integer)
                     The port at Ip that you want to forward DNS queries to.

          ResolverEndpointId -> (string)
              The ID of the endpoint that the rule is associated with.

          OwnerId -> (string)
              When  a rule is shared with another Amazon Web Services account,
              the account ID of the account that the rule is shared with.

          ShareStatus -> (string)
              Whether the rule is shared and, if so, whether the  current  ac-
              count  is  sharing the rule with another account, or another ac-
              count is sharing the rule with the current account.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The date and time that the Resolver rule was  created,  in  Unix
              time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          ModificationTime -> (string)
              The  date  and  time that the Resolver rule was last updated, in
              Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
