NAME
       update-resolver-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  settings  for a specified Resolver rule. ResolverRuleId is re-
       quired, and all other parameters are optional. If you don't  specify  a
       parameter, it retains its current value.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-resolver-rule
          --resolver-rule-id <value>
          --config <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resolver-rule-id (string)
          The ID of the Resolver rule that you want to update.

       --config (structure)
          The new settings for the Resolver rule.

          Name -> (string)
              The  new  name  for the Resolver rule. The name that you specify
              appears in the Resolver dashboard in the Route 53 console.

          TargetIps -> (list)
              For DNS queries that originate in your VPC, the new IP addresses
              that you want to route outbound DNS queries to.

              (structure)
                 In a CreateResolverRule request, an array of the IPs that you
                 want to forward DNS queries to.

                 Ip -> (string)
                     One IP address that you want to forward DNS  queries  to.
                     You can specify only IPv4 addresses.

                 Port -> (integer)
                     The port at Ip that you want to forward DNS queries to.

          ResolverEndpointId -> (string)
              The  ID  of  the new outbound Resolver endpoint that you want to
              use to route DNS queries to the IP addresses that you specify in
              TargetIps .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,TargetIps=[{Ip=string,Port=integer},{Ip=string,Port=integer}],ResolverEndpointId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "string",
            "TargetIps": [
              {
                "Ip": "string",
                "Port": integer
              }
              ...
            ],
            "ResolverEndpointId": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To update settings Resolver endpoint

       The  following  update-resolver-rule  example  updates  the name of the
       rule, the IP addresses on your on-premises network that DNS queries are
       forwarded  to, and the ID of the outbound Resolver endpoint that you're
       using to forward queries to your network.

       Note Existing values for TargetIps are overwritten, so you must specify
       all the IP addresses that you want the rule to have after the update.

          aws route53resolver update-resolver-rule \
              --resolver-rule-id rslvr-rr-1247fa64f3example \
              --config Name="my-2nd-rule",TargetIps=[{Ip=192.0.2.45,Port=53},{Ip=192.0.2.46,Port=53}],ResolverEndpointId=rslvr-out-7b89ed0d25example

       Output:

          {
              "ResolverRule": {
                  "Id": "rslvr-rr-1247fa64f3example",
                  "CreatorRequestId": "2020-01-02-18:47",
                  "Arn": "arn:aws:route53resolver:us-west-2:111122223333:resolver-rule/rslvr-rr-1247fa64f3example",
                  "DomainName": "www.example.com.",
                  "Status": "COMPLETE",
                  "StatusMessage": "[Trace id: 1-5dcc90b9-8a8ee860aba1ebd89example] Successfully updated Resolver Rule.",

                  "Name": "my-2nd-rule",
                  "TargetIps": [
                      {
                          "Ip": "192.0.2.45",
                          "Port": 53
                      },
                      {
                          "Ip": "192.0.2.46",
                          "Port": 53
                      }

                  "ShareStatus": "NOT_SHARED"
              }
          }

       Example 2: To update settings Resolver endpoint using a file for ``con-
       fig`` settings

       You can alternatively include the config settings in a  JSON  file  and
       then specify that file when you call update-resolver-rule.

          aws route53resolver update-resolver-rule \
              --resolver-rule-id rslvr-rr-1247fa64f3example \
              --config file://c:\temp\update-resolver-rule.json

       Contents of update-resolver-rule.json.

          {
              "Name": "my-2nd-rule",
              "TargetIps": [
                  {
                      "Ip": "192.0.2.45",
                      "Port": 53
                  },
                  {
                      "Ip": "192.0.2.46",
                      "Port": 53
                  }
              ],
              "ResolverEndpointId": "rslvr-out-7b89ed0d25example"
          }

       Edit Rules in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       ResolverRule -> (structure)
          The response to an UpdateResolverRule request.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID that Resolver assigned to the Resolver rule when you cre-
              ated it.

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A unique string that you specified when you created the Resolver
              rule. CreatorRequestId identifies the request and allows  failed
              requests to be retried without the risk of running the operation
              twice.

          Arn -> (string)
              The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the Resolver  rule  specified
              by Id .

          DomainName -> (string)
              DNS  queries  for  this  domain name are forwarded to the IP ad-
              dresses that are specified in TargetIps .  If  a  query  matches
              multiple  Resolver  rules (example.com and www.example.com), the
              query is routed using the Resolver rule that contains  the  most
              specific domain name (www.example.com).

          Status -> (string)
              A code that specifies the current status of the Resolver rule.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              A detailed description of the status of a Resolver rule.

          RuleType -> (string)
              When  you  want to forward DNS queries for specified domain name
              to resolvers on your network, specify FORWARD .

              When you have a forwarding rule to forward DNS queries for a do-
              main  to  your  network and you want Resolver to process queries
              for a subdomain of that domain, specify SYSTEM .

              For example, to forward DNS queries for example.com to resolvers
              on your network, you create a rule and specify FORWARD for Rule-
              Type . To then have  Resolver  process  queries  for  apex.exam-
              ple.com, you create a rule and specify SYSTEM for RuleType .

              Currently,  only  Resolver can create rules that have a value of
              RECURSIVE for RuleType .

          Name -> (string)
              The name for the Resolver rule, which  you  specified  when  you
              created the Resolver rule.

          TargetIps -> (list)
              An  array  that contains the IP addresses and ports that an out-
              bound endpoint forwards DNS queries to. Typically, these are the
              IP  addresses of DNS resolvers on your network. Specify IPv4 ad-
              dresses. IPv6 is not supported.

              (structure)
                 In a CreateResolverRule request, an array of the IPs that you
                 want to forward DNS queries to.

                 Ip -> (string)
                     One  IP  address that you want to forward DNS queries to.
                     You can specify only IPv4 addresses.

                 Port -> (integer)
                     The port at Ip that you want to forward DNS queries to.

          ResolverEndpointId -> (string)
              The ID of the endpoint that the rule is associated with.

          OwnerId -> (string)
              When a rule is shared with another Amazon Web Services  account,
              the account ID of the account that the rule is shared with.

          ShareStatus -> (string)
              Whether  the  rule is shared and, if so, whether the current ac-
              count is sharing the rule with another account, or  another  ac-
              count is sharing the rule with the current account.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The  date  and  time that the Resolver rule was created, in Unix
              time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          ModificationTime -> (string)
              The date and time that the Resolver rule was  last  updated,  in
              Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
