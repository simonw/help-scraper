          The ID of the Resolver rule that you want to update.

       --config (structure)
          The new settings for the Resolver rule.

          Name -> (string)
              The  new  name  for the Resolver rule. The name that you specify
              appears in the Resolver dashboard in the Route 53 console.

          TargetIps -> (list)
              For DNS queries that originate in your VPC, the new IP addresses
              that you want to route outbound DNS queries to.

              (structure)
                 In a CreateResolverRule request, an array of the IPs that you
                 want to forward DNS queries to.

                 Ip -> (string)
                     One IPv4 address that you want to forward DNS queries to.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,TargetIps=[{Ip=string,Port=integer,Ipv6=string,Protocol=string,ServerNameIndication=string},{Ip=string,Port=integer,Ipv6=string,Protocol=string,ServerNameIndication=string}],ResolverEndpointId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "string",
            "TargetIps": [
              {
                "Ip": "string",
                "Port": integer,
                "Ipv6": "string",
                "Protocol": "DoH"|"Do53"|"DoH-FIPS",
                "ServerNameIndication": "string"
              }
              ...
            ],
            "ResolverEndpointId": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To update settings Resolver endpoint

       The  following  update-resolver-rule  example  updates  the name of the
       rule, the IP addresses on your on-premises network that DNS queries are
       forwarded  to, and the ID of the outbound Resolver endpoint that you're
       using to forward queries to your network.

       Note Existing values for TargetIps are overwritten, so you must specify
       all the IP addresses that you want the rule to have after the update.

          aws route53resolver update-resolver-rule \
              --resolver-rule-id rslvr-rr-1247fa64f3example \
              --config Name="my-2nd-rule",TargetIps=[{Ip=192.0.2.45,Port=53},{Ip=192.0.2.46,Port=53}],ResolverEndpointId=rslvr-out-7b89ed0d25example

       Output:

          {
              "ResolverRule": {
                  "Id": "rslvr-rr-1247fa64f3example",
                  "CreatorRequestId": "2020-01-02-18:47",
                  "Arn": "arn:aws:route53resolver:us-west-2:111122223333:resolver-rule/rslvr-rr-1247fa64f3example",
                  "DomainName": "www.example.com.",
                  "Status": "COMPLETE",
                  "StatusMessage": "[Trace id: 1-5dcc90b9-8a8ee860aba1ebd89example] Successfully updated Resolver Rule.",
                  "RuleType": "FORWARD",
                  "Name": "my-2nd-rule",
                  "TargetIps": [
                      {
                          "Ip": "192.0.2.45",
                          "Port": 53
                      },
                      {
                          "Ip": "192.0.2.46",
                          "Port": 53
                      }
                  ],
                  "ResolverEndpointId": "rslvr-out-7b89ed0d25example",
                  "OwnerId": "111122223333",
                  "ShareStatus": "NOT_SHARED"
              }
          }

       Example 2: To update settings Resolver endpoint using a file for ``con-
       fig`` settings

       You can alternatively include the config settings in a  JSON  file  and
       then specify that file when you call update-resolver-rule.

          aws route53resolver update-resolver-rule \
              --resolver-rule-id rslvr-rr-1247fa64f3example \
              --config file://c:\temp\update-resolver-rule.json

       Contents of update-resolver-rule.json.

          {
              "Name": "my-2nd-rule",
              "TargetIps": [
                  {
                      "Ip": "192.0.2.45",
                      "Port": 53
                  },
                  {
                      "Ip": "192.0.2.46",
                      "Port": 53
                  }
              ],
              "ResolverEndpointId": "rslvr-out-7b89ed0d25example"
          }

       Edit Rules in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       ResolverRule -> (structure)
          The response to an UpdateResolverRule request.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID that Resolver assigned to the Resolver rule when you cre-
              ated it.

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A unique string that you specified when you created the Resolver
              rule. CreatorRequestId identifies the request and allows  failed
              requests to be retried without the risk of running the operation
              twice.

          Arn -> (string)
              The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the Resolver  rule  specified
              by Id .

          DomainName -> (string)
              DNS  queries  for  this  domain name are forwarded to the IP ad-
              dresses that are specified in TargetIps .  If  a  query  matches
              multiple  Resolver  rules (example.com and www.example.com), the
              query is routed using the Resolver rule that contains  the  most
              specific domain name (www.example.com).

          Status -> (string)
              A code that specifies the current status of the Resolver rule.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              A detailed description of the status of a Resolver rule.

          RuleType -> (string)
              When  you  want to forward DNS queries for specified domain name
              to resolvers on your network, specify FORWARD .

              When you have a forwarding rule to forward DNS queries for a do-
              main  to  your  network and you want Resolver to process queries
              for a subdomain of that domain, specify SYSTEM .

              For example, to forward DNS queries for example.com to resolvers
              on your network, you create a rule and specify FORWARD for Rule-
              Type . To then have  Resolver  process  queries  for  apex.exam-
              ple.com, you create a rule and specify SYSTEM for RuleType .

              Currently,  only  Resolver can create rules that have a value of
              RECURSIVE for RuleType .

          Name -> (string)
              The name for the Resolver rule, which  you  specified  when  you
              created the Resolver rule.

          TargetIps -> (list)
              An  array  that contains the IP addresses and ports that an out-
              bound endpoint forwards DNS queries to. Typically, these are the
              IP addresses of DNS resolvers on your network.

              (structure)
                 In a CreateResolverRule request, an array of the IPs that you
                 want to forward DNS queries to.

                 Ip -> (string)
                     One IPv4 address that you want to forward DNS queries to.

                 Port -> (integer)
                     The port at Ip that you want to forward DNS queries to.

                 Ipv6 -> (string)
                     One IPv6 address that you want to forward DNS queries to.

                 Protocol -> (string)
                     The protocols for the target address.  The  protocol  you
                     choose  needs to be supported by the outbound endpoint of
                     the Resolver rule.

                 ServerNameIndication -> (string)
                     The Server Name Indication of the  DoH  server  that  you
                     want to forward queries to. This is only used if the Pro-
                     tocol of the TargetAddress is DoH .

          ResolverEndpointId -> (string)
              The ID of the endpoint that the rule is associated with.

          OwnerId -> (string)
              When a rule is shared with another Amazon Web Services  account,
              the account ID of the account that the rule is shared with.

          ShareStatus -> (string)
              Whether  the  rule is shared and, if so, whether the current ac-
              count is sharing the rule with another account, or  another  ac-
              count is sharing the rule with the current account.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The  date  and  time that the Resolver rule was created, in Unix
              time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          ModificationTime -> (string)
              The date and time that the Resolver rule was  last  updated,  in
              Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
