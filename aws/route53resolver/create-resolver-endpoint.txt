CREATE-RESOLVER-ENDPOINT()                          CREATE-RESOLVER-ENDPOINT()



NAME
       create-resolver-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a Resolver endpoint. There are two types of Resolver endpoints,
       inbound and outbound:

       o An inbound Resolver endpoint forwards DNS queries to the DNS  service
         for a VPC from your network.

       o An  outbound Resolver endpoint forwards DNS queries from the DNS ser-
         vice for a VPC to your network.

OPTIONS
       --creator-request-id (string)
          A unique string that identifies the request and that  allows  failed
          requests  to  be  retried  without the risk of running the operation
          twice. CreatorRequestId can be any unique  string,  for  example,  a
          date/time stamp.

       --name (string)
          A friendly name that lets you easily find a configuration in the Re-
          solver dashboard in the Route 53 console.

       --security-group-ids (list)
          The ID of one or more security groups that you want to use  to  con-
          trol  access  to  this VPC. The security group that you specify must
          include one or more inbound rules (for inbound  Resolver  endpoints)
          or  outbound  rules  (for  outbound Resolver endpoints). Inbound and
          outbound rules must allow TCP and UDP access.  For  inbound  access,
          open  port  53. For outbound access, open the port that you're using
          for DNS queries on your network.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --direction (string)
          Specify the applicable value:

          o INBOUND : Resolver forwards DNS queries to the DNS service  for  a
            VPC from your network

          o OUTBOUND  : Resolver forwards DNS queries from the DNS service for
            a VPC to your network

          Possible values:

          o INBOUND

          o OUTBOUND

       --ip-addresses (list)
          The subnets and IP addresses in your VPC that DNS queries  originate
          from  (for  outbound  endpoints)  or that you forward DNS queries to
          (for inbound endpoints). The subnet ID uniquely identifies a VPC.

          (structure)
              In a CreateResolverEndpoint request, the  IP  address  that  DNS
              queries originate from (for outbound endpoints) or that you for-
              ward DNS queries to (for  inbound  endpoints).  IpAddressRequest
              also includes the ID of the subnet that contains the IP address.

              SubnetId -> (string)
                 The ID of the subnet that contains the IP address.

              Ip -> (string)
                 The IPv4 address that you want to use for DNS queries.

              Ipv6 -> (string)
                 The IPv6 address that you want to use for DNS queries.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SubnetId=string,Ip=string,Ipv6=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "SubnetId": "string",
              "Ip": "string",
              "Ipv6": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  the tag keys and values that you want to associate with
          the endpoint.

          (structure)
              One tag that you want to add to the specified  resource.  A  tag
              consists of a Key (a name for the tag) and a Value .

              Key -> (string)
                 The  name  for the tag. For example, if you want to associate
                 Resolver resources with the account IDs of your customers for
                 billing purposes, the value of Key might be account-id .

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value  for  the tag. For example, if Key is account-id ,
                 then Value might be the  ID  of  the  customer  account  that
                 you're creating the resource for.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --resolver-endpoint-type (string)
          For  the  endpoint  type  you  can  choose  either  IPv4,  IPv6.  or
          dual-stack. A dual-stack endpoint means that  it  will  resolve  via
          both  IPv4  and  IPv6.  This  endpoint type is applied to all IP ad-
          dresses.

          Possible values:

          o IPV6

          o IPV4

          o DUALSTACK

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create an inbound Resolver endpoint

       The following create-resolver-endpoint example creates an  inbound  Re-
       solver  endpoint.  You  can use the same command to create both inbound
       and outbound endpoints.

          aws route53resolver create-resolver-endpoint
                 --name        my-inbound-endpoint        --creator-request-id
                 2020-01-01-18:47  --security-group-ids "sg-f62bexam" --direc-
                 tion       INBOUND        --ip-addresses        SubnetId=sub-
                 net-ba47exam,Ip=192.0.2.255                     SubnetId=sub-
                 net-12d8exam,Ip=192.0.2.254

       Output:

          {
              "ResolverEndpoint": {
                  "Id": "rslvr-in-f9ab8a03f1example",

                  "SecurityGroupIds": [
                      "sg-f62bexam"
                  ],
                  "Direction": "INBOUND",
                  "IpAddressCount": 2,
                  "HostVPCId": "vpc-304examp",

              }
          }

       To create an outbound Resolver endpoint

       The following create-resolver-endpoint example creates an outbound  re-
       solver  endpoint  using  the values in the JSON-formatted document cre-
       ate-outbound-resolver-endpoint.json.

          aws route53resolver create-resolver-endpoint \
              --cli-input-json file://c:\temp\create-outbound-resolver-endpoint.json

       Contents of create-outbound-resolver-endpoint.json:

          {
             "CreatorRequestId": "2020-01-01-18:47",
             "Direction": "OUTBOUND",
             "IpAddresses": [
                {
                   "Ip": "192.0.2.255",
                   "SubnetId": "subnet-ba47exam"
                },
                {
                   "Ip": "192.0.2.254",
                   "SubnetId": "subnet-12d8exam"
                }
             ],
             "Name": "my-outbound-endpoint",
             "SecurityGroupIds": [ "sg-05cd7b25d6example" ],
             "Tags": [

                   "Key": "my-key-name",
                   "Value": "my-key-value"
                }
             ]
          }

OUTPUT
       ResolverEndpoint -> (structure)
          Information  about the CreateResolverEndpoint request, including the
          status of the request.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID of the Resolver endpoint.

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A unique string that identifies the request that created the Re-
              solver  endpoint. The CreatorRequestId allows failed requests to
              be retried without the risk of running the operation twice.

          Arn -> (string)
              The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the Resolver endpoint.

          Name -> (string)
              The name that you assigned to the  Resolver  endpoint  when  you
              submitted a CreateResolverEndpoint request.

          SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              The  ID  of  one  or more security groups that control access to
              this VPC. The security group must include one  or  more  inbound
              rules  (for  inbound  endpoints) or outbound rules (for outbound
              endpoints). Inbound and outbound rules must allow  TCP  and  UDP
              access.  For  inbound access, open port 53. For outbound access,
              open the port that you're using for DNS queries on your network.

              (string)

          Direction -> (string)
              Indicates whether the Resolver endpoint allows inbound  or  out-
              bound DNS queries:

              o INBOUND : allows DNS queries to your VPC from your network

              o OUTBOUND : allows DNS queries from your VPC to your network

          IpAddressCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of  IP addresses that the Resolver endpoint can use
              for DNS queries.

          HostVPCId -> (string)
              The ID of the VPC that you want to create the Resolver  endpoint
              in.

          Status -> (string)
              A  code  that  specifies the current status of the Resolver end-
              point. Valid values include the following:

              o CREATING : Resolver is creating and configuring  one  or  more
                Amazon VPC network interfaces for this endpoint.

              o OPERATIONAL  : The Amazon VPC network interfaces for this end-
                point are correctly configured and able  to  pass  inbound  or
                outbound DNS queries between your network and Resolver.

              o UPDATING  :  Resolver  is associating or disassociating one or
                more network interfaces with this endpoint.

              o AUTO_RECOVERING : Resolver is trying to recover one or more of
                the network interfaces that are associated with this endpoint.
                During the recovery process, the endpoint functions with  lim-
                ited  capacity  because  of  the  limit  on  the number of DNS
                queries per IP address (per network interface). For  the  cur-
                rent limit, see Limits on Route 53 Resolver .

              o ACTION_NEEDED : This endpoint is unhealthy, and Resolver can't
                automatically recover it. To resolve the problem, we recommend
                that  you  check  each IP address that you associated with the
                endpoint. For each IP address that isn't  available,  add  an-
                other  IP  address  and  then delete the IP address that isn't
                available. (An endpoint must always include at  least  two  IP
                addresses.)  A  status  of ACTION_NEEDED can have a variety of
                causes. Here are two common causes:

                o One or more of the network interfaces  that  are  associated
                  with the endpoint were deleted using Amazon VPC.

                o The  network  interface  couldn't be created for some reason
                  that's outside the control of Resolver.

              o DELETING : Resolver is deleting this endpoint and the  associ-
                ated network interfaces.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              A detailed description of the status of the Resolver endpoint.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The  date  and  time that the endpoint was created, in Unix time
              format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          ModificationTime -> (string)
              The date and time that the endpoint was last modified,  in  Unix
              time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          ResolverEndpointType -> (string)
              The Resolver endpoint IP address type.
