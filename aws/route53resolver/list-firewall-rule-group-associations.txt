LIST-FIREWALL-RULE-GROUP-ASSOCIATIONS()LIST-FIREWALL-RULE-GROUP-ASSOCIATIONS()



NAME
       list-firewall-rule-group-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  firewall rule group associations that you have defined.
       Each association enables DNS filtering for a VPC with one rule group.

       A single call might return only a partial list of the associations. For
       information, see MaxResults .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-firewall-rule-group-associations  is a paginated operation. Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate ar-
       gument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on  a  pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: FirewallRuleGroupAssociations

SYNOPSIS
            list-firewall-rule-group-associations
          [--firewall-rule-group-id <value>]
          [--vpc-id <value>]
          [--priority <value>]
          [--status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --firewall-rule-group-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the firewall rule group that  you  want  to
          retrieve the associations for. Leave this blank to retrieve associa-
          tions for any rule group.

       --vpc-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the VPC that you want to retrieve the asso-
          ciations for. Leave this blank to retrieve associations for any VPC.

       --priority (integer)
          The  setting  that determines the processing order of the rule group
          among the rule groups that are associated with  a  single  VPC.  DNS
          Firewall  filters  VPC traffic starting from the rule group with the
          lowest numeric priority setting.

       --status (string)
          The association Status setting that you want DNS Firewall to  filter
          on  for  the  list. If you don't specify this, then DNS Firewall re-
          turns all associations, regardless of status.

          Possible values:

          o COMPLETE

          o DELETING

          o UPDATING

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If objects are still available for retrieval, Resolver returns  this
          token  in  the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, pro-
          vide this token in your next request.

       FirewallRuleGroupAssociations -> (list)
          A list of your firewall rule group associations.

          This might be a partial list of the associations that you  have  de-
          fined. For information, see MaxResults .

          (structure)
              An  association  between  a firewall rule group and a VPC, which
              enables DNS filtering for the VPC.

              Id -> (string)
                 The identifier for the association.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall rule group as-
                 sociation.

              FirewallRuleGroupId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the firewall rule group.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The  unique identifier of the VPC that is associated with the
                 rule group.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the association.

              Priority -> (integer)
                 The setting that determines the processing order of the  rule
                 group among the rule groups that are associated with a single
                 VPC. DNS Firewall filters  VPC  traffic  starting  from  rule
                 group with the lowest numeric priority setting.

              MutationProtection -> (string)
                 If enabled, this setting disallows modification or removal of
                 the association, to help prevent against accidentally  alter-
                 ing DNS firewall protections.

              ManagedOwnerName -> (string)
                 The owner of the association, used only for associations that
                 are not managed by you. If you use Firewall Manager to manage
                 your DNS Firewalls, then this reports Firewall Manager as the
                 managed owner.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status of the association.

              StatusMessage -> (string)
                 Additional information about the status of the  response,  if
                 available.

              CreatorRequestId -> (string)
                 A  unique string defined by you to identify the request. This
                 allows you to retry failed requests without the risk of  run-
                 ning  the operation twice. This can be any unique string, for
                 example, a timestamp.

              CreationTime -> (string)
                 The date and time that the association was created,  in  Unix
                 time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

              ModificationTime -> (string)
                 The  date and time that the association was last modified, in
                 Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
