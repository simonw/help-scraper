NAME
       list-resolver-endpoint-ip-addresses -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the IP addresses for a specified Resolver endpoint.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-resolver-endpoint-ip-addresses  is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: IpAddresses

SYNOPSIS
            list-resolver-endpoint-ip-addresses
          --resolver-endpoint-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resolver-endpoint-id (string)
          The ID of the Resolver endpoint that you want to  get  IP  addresses
          for.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list IP addresses for a specified inbound or outbound endpoint

       The following list-resolver-endpoint-ip-addresses example lists  infor-
       mation about the IP addresses that are associated with the inbound end-
       point rslvr-in-f9ab8a03f1example. You can also  use  list-resolver-end-
       point-ip-addresses  for outbound endpoints by specifying the applicable
       endpoint ID.

          aws route53resolver list-resolver-endpoint-ip-addresses \
              --resolver-endpoint-id rslvr-in-f9ab8a03f1example

       Output:

          {
              "MaxResults": 10,
              "IpAddresses": [
                  {
                      "IpId": "rni-1de60cdbfeexample",

          queries to (for inbound endpoints).

          (structure)
              In the response to a  GetResolverEndpoint  request,  information
