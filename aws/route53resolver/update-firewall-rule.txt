DESCRIPTION
       Updates the specified firewall rule.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-firewall-rule
          --firewall-rule-group-id <value>
          --firewall-domain-list-id <value>
          [--priority <value>]
          [--action <value>]
          [--block-response <value>]
          [--block-override-domain <value>]
          [--block-override-dns-type <value>]
          [--block-override-ttl <value>]
          [--name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --firewall-rule-group-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the firewall rule group for the rule.

       --firewall-domain-list-id (string)
          The ID of the domain list to use in the rule.

       --priority (integer)
          The  setting that determines the processing order of the rule in the
          rule group. DNS Firewall processes the rules in a rule group by  or-
          der of priority, starting from the lowest setting.

          You must specify a unique priority for each rule in a rule group. To
          make it easier to insert rules later, leave space between  the  num-
          bers,  for example, use 100, 200, and so on. You can change the pri-
          ority setting for the rules in a rule group at any time.

       --action (string)
          The action that DNS Firewall should take on  a  DNS  query  when  it
          matches one of the domains in the rule's domain list:

          o ALLOW - Permit the request to go through.

          o ALERT  - Permit the request to go through but send an alert to the
            logs.

          o BLOCK - Disallow the request. This option requires additional  de-
            tails in the rule's BlockResponse .

          Possible values:

          o ALLOW

          o BLOCK

          o ALERT

       --block-response (string)
          The  way  that  you want DNS Firewall to block the request. Used for
          the rule action setting BLOCK .

          o NODATA - Respond indicating that the query was successful, but  no
            response is available for it.

          o NXDOMAIN  -  Respond indicating that the domain name that's in the
            query doesn't exist.

          o OVERRIDE - Provide a custom override in the response. This  option
            requires custom handling details in the rule's BlockOverride* set-
            tings.

          Possible values:

          o NODATA

          o NXDOMAIN

          o OVERRIDE

       --block-override-domain (string)
          The custom DNS record to send back in response to  the  query.  Used
          for the rule action BLOCK with a BlockResponse setting of OVERRIDE .

       --block-override-dns-type (string)
          The  DNS  record's  type.  This  determines the format of the record
          value that you provided in BlockOverrideDomain . Used for  the  rule
          action BLOCK with a BlockResponse setting of OVERRIDE .

          Possible values:

          o CNAME

       --block-override-ttl (integer)
          The  recommended amount of time, in seconds, for the DNS resolver or
          web browser to cache the provided override record. Used for the rule
          action BLOCK with a BlockResponse setting of OVERRIDE .

       --name (string)
          The name of the rule.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a firewall rule

       The following update-firewall-rule example updates a firewall rule with
       the parameters you specify.

          aws route53resolver update-firewall-rule \
              --firewall-rule-group-id rslvr-frg-47f93271fexample \
              --firewall-domain-list-id rslvr-fdl-9e956e9ffexample \
              --priority 102

       Output:

          {
              "FirewallRule": {
                  "FirewallRuleGroupId": "rslvr-frg-47f93271fexample",
                  "FirewallDomainListId": "rslvr-fdl-9e956e9ffexample",
                  "Name": "allow-rule",
                  "Priority": 102,
                  "Action": "ALLOW",
                  "CreatorRequestId": "d81e3fb7-020b-415e-939f-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "CreationTime": "2021-05-25T21:44:00.346093Z",
                  "ModificationTime": "2021-05-25T21:45:59.611600Z"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       FirewallRule -> (structure)
          The firewall rule that you just updated.

          FirewallRuleGroupId -> (string)
              The unique identifier of the firewall rule group of the rule.

          FirewallDomainListId -> (string)
              The ID of the domain list that's used in the rule.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the rule.

          Priority -> (integer)
              The priority of the rule in the rule group. This value  must  be
              unique  within  the rule group. DNS Firewall processes the rules
              in a rule group by order of priority, starting from  the  lowest
              setting.

          Action -> (string)
              The  action that DNS Firewall should take on a DNS query when it
              matches one of the domains in the rule's domain list:

              o ALLOW - Permit the request to go through.

              o ALERT - Permit the request to go through but send an alert  to
                the logs.

              o BLOCK - Disallow the request. If this is specified, additional
                handling details are provided in the rule's BlockResponse set-
                ting.

          BlockResponse -> (string)
              The  way  that  you want DNS Firewall to block the request. Used
              for the rule action setting BLOCK .

              o NODATA - Respond indicating that the query was successful, but
                no response is available for it.

              o NXDOMAIN  -  Respond indicating that the domain name that's in
                the query doesn't exist.

              o OVERRIDE - Provide a custom override in the response. This op-
                tion requires custom handling details in the rule's BlockOver-
                ride* settings.

          BlockOverrideDomain -> (string)
              The custom DNS record to send back in  response  to  the  query.
              Used  for  the rule action BLOCK with a BlockResponse setting of
              OVERRIDE .

          BlockOverrideDnsType -> (string)
              The DNS record's type. This determines the format of the  record
              value  that  you  provided in BlockOverrideDomain . Used for the
              rule action BLOCK with a BlockResponse setting of OVERRIDE .

          BlockOverrideTtl -> (integer)
              The recommended amount of time, in seconds, for the DNS resolver
              or  web  browser to cache the provided override record. Used for

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A unique string defined by you to identify the request. This al-
              lows  you to retry failed requests without the risk of executing
              the operation twice. This can be any unique string, for example,
              a timestamp.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The date and time that the rule was created, in Unix time format
              and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          ModificationTime -> (string)
