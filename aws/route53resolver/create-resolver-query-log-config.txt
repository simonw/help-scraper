CREATE-RESOLVER-QUERY-LOG-CONFIG()          CREATE-RESOLVER-QUERY-LOG-CONFIG()



NAME
       create-resolver-query-log-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a Resolver query logging configuration, which defines where you
       want Resolver to save DNS query logs that originate in your  VPCs.  Re-
       solver can log queries only for VPCs that are in the same Region as the
       query logging configuration.

       To specify which VPCs you want to log queries for, you use AssociateRe-
       solverQueryLogConfig      .      For      more     information,     see
       AssociateResolverQueryLogConfig .

       You can optionally use Resource Access Manager (RAM) to share  a  query
       logging  configuration  with  other  Amazon  Web Services accounts. The
       other accounts can then associate  VPCs  with  the  configuration.  The
       query  logs  that  Resolver creates for a configuration include all DNS
       queries that originate in all VPCs that are associated with the config-
       uration.

SYNOPSIS
            create-resolver-query-log-config
          --name <value>
          --destination-arn <value>
          [--creator-request-id <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name that you want to give the query logging configuration.

       --destination-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of the resource that you want Resolver to send query logs.
          You can send query logs to an  S3  bucket,  a  CloudWatch  Logs  log
          group, or a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream. Examples of valid
          values include the following:

          o S3 bucket :   arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket   You can optionally  ap-
            pend  a  file prefix to the end of the ARN.  arn:aws:s3:::example-
            bucket/development/

          o CloudWatch          Logs           log           group           :
            arn:aws:logs:us-west-1:123456789012:log-group:/mystack-test-
            group-12ABC1AB12A1:*

          o Kinesis   Data   Firehose   delivery   stream   :    arn:aws:kine-
            sis:us-east-2:0123456789:stream/my_stream_name

       --creator-request-id (string)
          A  unique  string that identifies the request and that allows failed
          requests to be retried without the risk  of  running  the  operation
          twice.  CreatorRequestId  can  be  any unique string, for example, a
          date/time stamp.

       --tags (list)
          A list of the tag keys and values that you want  to  associate  with
          the query logging configuration.

          (structure)
              One  tag  that  you want to add to the specified resource. A tag
              consists of a Key (a name for the tag) and a Value .

              Key -> (string)
                 The name for the tag. For example, if you want  to  associate
                 Resolver resources with the account IDs of your customers for
                 billing purposes, the value of Key might be account-id .

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for the tag. For example, if Key  is  account-id  ,
                 then  Value  might  be  the  ID  of the customer account that
                 you're creating the resource for.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ResolverQueryLogConfig -> (structure)
          Information about the CreateResolverQueryLogConfig request,  includ-
          ing the status of the request.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID for the query logging configuration.

          OwnerId -> (string)
              The  Amazon Web Services account ID for the account that created
              the query logging configuration.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the specified query logging  configuration.  Valid
              values include the following:

              o CREATING  :  Resolver is creating the query logging configura-
                tion.

              o CREATED : The query  logging  configuration  was  successfully
                created.  Resolver  is  logging  queries that originate in the
                specified VPC.

              o DELETING : Resolver is deleting this query logging  configura-
                tion.

              o FAILED  :  Resolver can't deliver logs to the location that is
                specified in the query logging  configuration.  Here  are  two
                common causes:

                o The specified destination (for example, an Amazon S3 bucket)
                  was deleted.

                o Permissions don't allow sending logs to the destination.

          ShareStatus -> (string)
              An indication of whether  the  query  logging  configuration  is
              shared  with  other  Amazon Web Services accounts, or was shared
              with the current account by another Amazon Web Services account.
              Sharing is configured through Resource Access Manager (RAM).

          AssociationCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of  VPCs that are associated with the query logging
              configuration.

          Arn -> (string)
              The ARN for the query logging configuration.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the query logging configuration.

          DestinationArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the resource that you want  Resolver  to  send  query
              logs: an Amazon S3 bucket, a CloudWatch Logs log group, or a Ki-
              nesis Data Firehose delivery stream.

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A unique string that identifies the  request  that  created  the
              query  logging configuration. The CreatorRequestId allows failed
              requests to be retried without the risk of running the operation
              twice.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The  date and time that the query logging configuration was cre-
              ated, in Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
