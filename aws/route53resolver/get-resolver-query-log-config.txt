GET-RESOLVER-QUERY-LOG-CONFIG()                GET-RESOLVER-QUERY-LOG-CONFIG()



NAME
       get-resolver-query-log-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  information  about  a specified Resolver query logging configura-
       tion, such as the number of VPCs  that  the  configuration  is  logging
       queries for and the location that logs are sent to.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-resolver-query-log-config
          --resolver-query-log-config-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resolver-query-log-config-id (string)
          The  ID of the Resolver query logging configuration that you want to
          get information about.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ResolverQueryLogConfig -> (structure)
          Information about the Resolver query logging configuration that  you
          specified in a GetQueryLogConfig request.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID for the query logging configuration.

          OwnerId -> (string)
              The  Amazon Web Services account ID for the account that created
              the query logging configuration.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the specified query logging  configuration.  Valid
              values include the following:

              o CREATING  :  Resolver is creating the query logging configura-
                tion.

              o CREATED : The query  logging  configuration  was  successfully
                created.  Resolver  is  logging  queries that originate in the
                specified VPC.

              o DELETING : Resolver is deleting this query logging  configura-
                tion.

              o FAILED  :  Resolver can't deliver logs to the location that is
                specified in the query logging  configuration.  Here  are  two
                common causes:

                o The specified destination (for example, an Amazon S3 bucket)
                  was deleted.

                o Permissions don't allow sending logs to the destination.

          ShareStatus -> (string)
              An indication of whether  the  query  logging  configuration  is
              shared  with  other  Amazon Web Services accounts, or was shared
              with the current account by another Amazon Web Services account.
              Sharing is configured through Resource Access Manager (RAM).

          AssociationCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of  VPCs that are associated with the query logging
              configuration.

          Arn -> (string)
              The ARN for the query logging configuration.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the query logging configuration.

          DestinationArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the resource that you want  Resolver  to  send  query
              logs: an Amazon S3 bucket, a CloudWatch Logs log group, or a Ki-
              nesis Data Firehose delivery stream.

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A unique string that identifies the  request  that  created  the
              query  logging configuration. The CreatorRequestId allows failed
              requests to be retried without the risk of running the operation
              twice.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The  date and time that the query logging configuration was cre-
              ated, in Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
