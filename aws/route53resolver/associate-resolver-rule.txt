ASSOCIATE-RESOLVER-RULE()                            ASSOCIATE-RESOLVER-RULE()



NAME
       associate-resolver-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates a Resolver rule with a VPC. When you associate a rule with a
       VPC, Resolver forwards all DNS queries for  the  domain  name  that  is
       specified  in  the  rule and that originate in the VPC. The queries are
       forwarded to the IP addresses for the DNS resolvers that are  specified
       in the rule. For more information about rules, see CreateResolverRule .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            associate-resolver-rule
          --resolver-rule-id <value>
          [--name <value>]
          --vpc-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resolver-rule-id (string)
          The ID of the Resolver rule that you want to associate with the VPC.
          To list the existing Resolver rules, use ListResolverRules .

       --name (string)
          A name for the association that you're creating between  a  Resolver
          rule and a VPC.

       --vpc-id (string)
          The ID of the VPC that you want to associate the Resolver rule with.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To associate a Resolver rule with a VPC

       The following associate-resolver-rule  example  associates  a  Resolver
       rule  with an Amazon VPC. After you run the command, Resolver starts to
       forward DNS queries to your network based on the settings in the  rule,
       such as the domain name of the queries that are forwarded.

          aws route53resolver associate-resolver-rule \
              --name my-resolver-rule-association \
              --resolver-rule-id rslvr-rr-42b60677c0example \
              --vpc-id vpc-304bexam

       Output:

          {
              "ResolverRuleAssociation": {
                  "Id": "rslvr-rrassoc-d61cbb2c8bexample",
                  "ResolverRuleId": "rslvr-rr-42b60677c0example",
                  "Name": "my-resolver-rule-association",
                  "VPCId": "vpc-304bexam",
                  "Status": "CREATING",
                  "StatusMessage": "[Trace id: 1-5dc5a8fa-ec2cc480d2ef07617example] Creating the association."
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       ResolverRuleAssociation -> (structure)
          Information about the AssociateResolverRule request,  including  the
          status of the request.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID of the association between a Resolver rule and a VPC. Re-
              solver   assigns    this    value    when    you    submit    an
              AssociateResolverRule request.

          ResolverRuleId -> (string)
              The  ID  of  the  Resolver rule that you associated with the VPC
              that is specified by VPCId .

          Name -> (string)
              The name of an association between a Resolver rule and a VPC.

          VPCId -> (string)
              The ID of the VPC that you associated the Resolver rule with.

          Status -> (string)
              A code that specifies the current status of the association  be-
              tween a Resolver rule and a VPC.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              A  detailed description of the status of the association between
              a Resolver rule and a VPC.
