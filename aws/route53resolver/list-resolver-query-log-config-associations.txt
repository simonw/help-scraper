NAME
       list-resolver-query-log-config-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists information about associations between Amazon VPCs and query log-
       ging configurations.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-resolver-query-log-config-associations is a  paginated  operation.
       Multiple  API  calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data
       set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the  --no-pagi-
       nate  argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a
       paginated response, the --query argument must extract data from the re-
       sults of the following query expressions: ResolverQueryLogConfigAssoci-
       ations

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An optional specification to return a subset of query logging  asso-
          ciations.

          NOTE:
              If  you submit a second or subsequent ListResolverQueryLogConfi-
              gAssociations request and specify the NextToken  parameter,  you
              must  use the same values for Filters , if any, as in the previ-
              ous request.

          (structure)
              For   Resolver   list   operations   (ListResolverEndpoints    ,
              ListResolverRules      ,      ListResolverRuleAssociations     ,
              ListResolverQueryLogConfigs                                    ,
              ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations           ),          and
              ListResolverDnssecConfigs ), an optional specification to return
              a subset of objects.

              To filter objects, such as Resolver endpoints or Resolver rules,
              you specify Name and Values . For example, to list only  inbound
              Resolver  endpoints,  specify Direction for Name and specify IN-
              BOUND for Values .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the parameter that you want to use to filter  ob-
                 jects.

                 The  valid  values  for Name depend on the action that you're
                 including   the   filter    in,    ListResolverEndpoints    ,
                 ListResolverRules     ,     ListResolverRuleAssociations    ,
                 ListResolverQueryLogConfigs               ,                or
                 ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations .

                 NOTE:
                        In  early  versions  of Resolver, values for Name were
                        listed as uppercase, with underscore  (_)  delimiters.
                        For example, CreatorRequestId was originally listed as
                        CREATOR_REQUEST_ID . Uppercase  values  for  Name  are
                        still supported.

                     ListResolverEndpoints

                 Valid values for Name include the following:

                 o CreatorRequestId  :  The  value that you specified when you
                   created the Resolver endpoint.

                 o Direction : Whether you want to return inbound or  outbound
                   Resolver  endpoints.  If  you  specify DIRECTION for Name ,
                   specify INBOUND or OUTBOUND for Values .

                 o HostVPCId : The ID of the VPC that inbound DNS queries pass
                   through  on the way from your network to your VPCs in a re-
                   gion, or the VPC that outbound queries pass through on  the
                   way    from    your    VPCs   to   your   network.   In   a
                   CreateResolverEndpoint request, SubnetId indirectly identi-
                   fies  the VPC. In a GetResolverEndpoint request, the VPC ID
                   for a Resolver endpoint is returned in the  HostVPCId  ele-
                   ment.

                 o IpAddressCount  :  The number of IP addresses that you have
                   associated with the Resolver endpoint.

                 o Name : The name of the Resolver endpoint.

                 o SecurityGroupIds : The IDs of the VPC security groups  that
                   you specified when you created the Resolver endpoint.

                 o Status  : The status of the Resolver endpoint. If you spec-
                   ify Status for Name , specify one of the  following  status
                   codes  for  Values  :  CREATING  , OPERATIONAL , UPDATING ,
                   AUTO_RECOVERING , ACTION_NEEDED , or DELETING  .  For  more
                   information, see Status in ResolverEndpoint .
                     ListResolverRules

                 Valid values for Name include the following:

                 o CreatorRequestId  :  The  value that you specified when you
                   created the Resolver rule.

                 o DomainName : The domain name for which Resolver is forward-
                   ing  DNS  queries  to  your  network. In the value that you
                   specify for Values , include a trailing dot (.)  after  the
                   domain  name.  For  example,  if  the  domain name is exam-
                   ple.com, specify the following value. Note  the  "."  after
                   com :  example.com.

                 o Name : The name of the Resolver rule.

                 o ResolverEndpointId  :  The ID of the Resolver endpoint that
                   the Resolver rule is associated with.

                 NOTE:
                     You can filter on the Resolver endpoint  only  for  rules
                     that have a value of FORWARD for RuleType .

                 o Status  :  The  status of the Resolver rule. If you specify
                   Status for Name , specify one of the following status codes
                   for Values : COMPLETE , DELETING , UPDATING , or FAILED .

                 o Type  :  The type of the Resolver rule. If you specify TYPE
                   for Name , specify FORWARD or SYSTEM for Values .

              Values -> (list)
                 When you're using a List operation and you want the operation
                 to  return a subset of objects, such as Resolver endpoints or
                 Resolver rules, the value of the parameter that you  want  to
                 use  to filter objects. For example, to list only inbound Re-
                 solver endpoints, specify Direction for Name and specify  IN-
                 BOUND for Values .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --sort-by (string)
          The  element  that  you want Resolver to sort query logging associa-
          tions by.

          NOTE:
              If you submit a second or subsequent  ListResolverQueryLogConfi-
              gAssociations  request  and specify the NextToken parameter, you
              must use the same value for SortBy , if any, as in the  previous
              request.

          Valid values include the following elements:

          o CreationTime : The ID of the query logging association.

          o Error  : If the value of Status is FAILED , the value of Error in-
            dicates the cause:

            o DESTINATION_NOT_FOUND : The specified destination (for  example,
              an Amazon S3 bucket) was deleted.

            o ACCESS_DENIED : Permissions don't allow sending logs to the des-
              tination.

          If Status is a value other than FAILED , ERROR is null.

          o Id : The ID of the query logging association

          o ResolverQueryLogConfigId : The ID of the query logging  configura-
            tion

          o ResourceId  :  The ID of the VPC that is associated with the query
            logging configuration

          o Status : The current status of the configuration. Valid values in-
            clude the following:

            o CREATING : Resolver is creating an association between an Amazon
              VPC and a query logging configuration.

            o CREATED : The association between an Amazon VPC and a query log-
              ging configuration was successfully created. Resolver is logging
              queries that originate in the specified VPC.

            o DELETING : Resolver is deleting this query logging association.

            o FAILED : Resolver either couldn't create or couldn't delete  the
              query logging association. Here are two common causes:

              o The  specified  destination (for example, an Amazon S3 bucket)
                was deleted.

              o Permissions don't allow sending logs to the destination.

       --sort-order (string)
          If you specified a value for SortBy , the order that you want  query
          logging associations to be listed in, ASCENDING or DESCENDING .

          NOTE:
              If  you submit a second or subsequent ListResolverQueryLogConfi-
              gAssociations request and specify the NextToken  parameter,  you
              must use the same value for SortOrder , if any, as in the previ-
              ous request.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If  there  are  more than MaxResults query logging associations, you
          can submit another ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations request to
          get the next group of associations. In the next request, specify the
          value of NextToken from the previous response.

       TotalCount -> (integer)
          The total number of query logging associations that were created  by
          the  current  account in the specified Region. This count can differ
          from the number of associations that are returned in a ListResolver-
          QueryLogConfigAssociations  response,  depending  on the values that
          you specify in the request.

       TotalFilteredCount -> (integer)
          The total number of query logging associations that were created  by
          the  current account in the specified Region and that match the fil-
          ters that were specified in  the  ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssocia-
          tions  request.  For the total number of associations that were cre-
          ated by the current account in the specified Region, see  TotalCount
          .

       ResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations -> (list)
          A  list that contains one ResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations element
          for each query logging association that matches the values that  you
          specified for Filter .

          (structure)
              In   the   response   to  an  AssociateResolverQueryLogConfig  ,

              GetResolverQueryLogConfigAssociation             ,            or
              ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations , request, a complex type
              that  contains  settings  for a specified association between an
              Amazon VPC and a query logging configuration.

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID of the query logging association.

              ResolverQueryLogConfigId -> (string)
                 The ID of the query logging configuration that a VPC is asso-
                 ciated with.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of  the Amazon VPC that is associated with the query
                 logging configuration.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the specified query logging association.  Valid
                 values include the following:

                 o CREATING  :  Resolver is creating an association between an
                   Amazon VPC and a query logging configuration.

                 o CREATED : The association between an Amazon VPC and a query
                   logging configuration was successfully created. Resolver is
                   logging queries that originate in the specified VPC.

                 o DELETING : Resolver is deleting this query logging associa-
                   tion.
