NAME
       associate-resolver-endpoint-ip-address -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  IP  addresses  to an inbound or an outbound Resolver endpoint. If
       you want to add more than one IP address, submit  one  AssociateResolv-
       erEndpointIpAddress request for each IP address.

       To     remove     an    IP    address    from    an    endpoint,    see
       DisassociateResolverEndpointIpAddress .

OPTIONS
       --resolver-endpoint-id (string)
          The ID of the Resolver endpoint that you want to  associate  IP  ad-
          dresses with.

       --ip-address (structure)
          Either  the IPv4 address that you want to add to a Resolver endpoint
          or a subnet ID. If you specify a subnet ID, Resolver chooses  an  IP
          address for you from the available IPs in the specified subnet.

          IpId -> (string)
              Only  when removing an IP address from a Resolver endpoint : The
              ID of the IP address that you want to remove. To  get  this  ID,
              use GetResolverEndpoint .

          SubnetId -> (string)
              The  ID of the subnet that includes the IP address that you want
              to update. To get this ID, use GetResolverEndpoint .

          Ip -> (string)
              The new IPv4 address.

          Ipv6 -> (string)
              The new IPv6 address.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          IpId=string,SubnetId=string,Ip=string,Ipv6=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "IpId": "string",
            "SubnetId": "string",
            "Ip": "string",
            "Ipv6": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To associate another IP address with a Resolver endpoint

       The following associate-resolver-endpoint-ip-address example associates
       another  IP  address  with an inbound Resolver endpoint. If you specify
       only a subnet ID and omit the IP address from the --ip-address  parame-
       ter, Resolver chooses an IP address for you from among the available IP
       addresses in the specified subnet.

          aws route53resolver associate-resolver-endpoint-ip-address \
              --resolver-endpoint-id rslvr-in-497098ad5example \
              --ip-address="SubnetId=subnet-12d8exam,Ip=192.0.2.118"

       Output:

          {

OUTPUT
       ResolverEndpoint -> (structure)
          The response to an AssociateResolverEndpointIpAddress request.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID of the Resolver endpoint.

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A unique string that identifies the request that created the Re-
              solver endpoint. The CreatorRequestId allows failed requests  to
              be retried without the risk of running the operation twice.

          Arn -> (string)
              The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the Resolver endpoint.

          Name -> (string)
              The  name  that  you  assigned to the Resolver endpoint when you
              submitted a CreateResolverEndpoint request.

          SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              The ID of one or more security groups  that  control  access  to
              this  VPC.  The  security group must include one or more inbound
              rules (for inbound endpoints) or outbound  rules  (for  outbound
              endpoints).  Inbound  and  outbound rules must allow TCP and UDP
              access. For inbound access, open port 53. For  outbound  access,
              open the port that you're using for DNS queries on your network.

              (string)

          Direction -> (string)
              Indicates  whether  the Resolver endpoint allows inbound or out-
              bound DNS queries:

              o INBOUND : allows DNS queries to your VPC from your network

              o OUTBOUND : allows DNS queries from your VPC to your network

          IpAddressCount -> (integer)
              The number of IP addresses that the Resolver  endpoint  can  use
              for DNS queries.

          HostVPCId -> (string)
              The  ID of the VPC that you want to create the Resolver endpoint
              in.

          Status -> (string)
              A code that specifies the current status of  the  Resolver  end-
              point. Valid values include the following:

              o CREATING  :  Resolver  is creating and configuring one or more
                Amazon VPC network interfaces for this endpoint.

              o OPERATIONAL : The Amazon VPC network interfaces for this  end-
                point  are  correctly  configured  and able to pass inbound or
                outbound DNS queries between your network and Resolver.

              o UPDATING : Resolver is associating or  disassociating  one  or
                more network interfaces with this endpoint.

              o AUTO_RECOVERING : Resolver is trying to recover one or more of
                the network interfaces that are associated with this endpoint.
                During  the recovery process, the endpoint functions with lim-
                ited capacity because of  the  limit  on  the  number  of  DNS
                queries  per  IP address (per network interface). For the cur-
                rent limit, see Limits on Route 53 Resolver .

              o ACTION_NEEDED : This endpoint is unhealthy, and Resolver can't
                automatically recover it. To resolve the problem, we recommend
                that you check each IP address that you  associated  with  the
                endpoint.  For  each  IP address that isn't available, add an-
                other IP address and then delete the  IP  address  that  isn't
                available.  (An  endpoint  must always include at least two IP
                addresses.) A status of ACTION_NEEDED can have  a  variety  of
                causes. Here are two common causes:

                o One  or  more  of the network interfaces that are associated
                  with the endpoint were deleted using Amazon VPC.

                o The network interface couldn't be created  for  some  reason
                  that's outside the control of Resolver.

              o DELETING  : Resolver is deleting this endpoint and the associ-
                ated network interfaces.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              A detailed description of the status of the Resolver endpoint.

          CreationTime -> (string)
              The date and time that the endpoint was created,  in  Unix  time
              format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          ModificationTime -> (string)
              The  date  and time that the endpoint was last modified, in Unix
              time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          ResolverEndpointType -> (string)
              The Resolver endpoint IP address type.
