CREATE-EVENT-DESTINATION()                          CREATE-EVENT-DESTINATION()



NAME
       create-event-destination -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new event destination in a configuration set.

       An  event  destination is a location where you send message events. The
       event options are Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon Data  Firehose,  or  Amazon
       SNS.  For  example,  when  a message is delivered successfully, you can
       send information about that event to an event destination, or send  no-
       tifications to endpoints that are subscribed to an Amazon SNS topic.

       Each  configuration set can contain between 0 and 5 event destinations.
       Each event destination can contain a reference to a single destination,
       such as a CloudWatch or Firehose destination.
