UPDATE-EVENT-DESTINATION()                          UPDATE-EVENT-DESTINATION()



NAME
       update-event-destination -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  an  existing event destination in a configuration set. You can
       update the IAM role ARN for CloudWatch Logs and Firehose. You can  also
       enable or disable the event destination.

       You  may  want  to  update  an event destination to change its matching
       event types or updating the destination resource ARN. You can't  change
       an event destination's type between CloudWatch Logs, Firehose, and Ama-
       zon SNS.

       the string will be taken literally.

       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
