DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns an array of  XssMatchSet objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-xss-match-sets
          [--next-marker <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-marker (string)
          If you specify a value for Limit and you have more  XssMatchSet  ob-
          jects  than  the value of Limit , AWS WAF returns a NextMarker value
          in the response that allows you to list another group  of  XssMatch-
          Sets  .  For  the  second  and subsequent ListXssMatchSets requests,
          specify the value of NextMarker from the previous  response  to  get
          information about another batch of XssMatchSets .

       --limit (integer)
          Specifies  the  number of  XssMatchSet objects that you want AWS WAF
          to return for this request. If you  have  more  XssMatchSet  objects
          than  the  number  you  specify  for Limit , the response includes a
          NextMarker value that you can use to get another batch of Rules .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextMarker -> (string)
          If you have more  XssMatchSet objects than the number that you spec-
          ified for Limit in the request, the response includes  a  NextMarker
          value.  To  list  more  XssMatchSet objects, submit another ListXss-
          MatchSets request, and specify the NextMarker  value  from  the  re-
          sponse in the NextMarker value in the next request.

       XssMatchSets -> (list)
          An array of  XssMatchSetSummary objects.

                 This  is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and  see  the  AWS  WAF Developer Guide . With the latest
                     version, AWS WAF has a single set of  endpoints  for  re-
                     gional and global use.

              The Id and Name of an XssMatchSet .

              XssMatchSetId -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier  for an XssMatchSet . You use XssMatch-
                 SetId to get information about a  XssMatchSet  (see   GetXss-
                 MatchSet  ), update an XssMatchSet (see  UpdateXssMatchSet ),
                 insert an XssMatchSet into a Rule or delete one from  a  Rule
                 (see   UpdateRule  ),  and delete an XssMatchSet from AWS WAF
                 (see  DeleteXssMatchSet ).
                     XssMatchSetId is returned by   CreateXssMatchSet  and  by
                     ListXssMatchSets .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the XssMatchSet , if any, specified by Id .
