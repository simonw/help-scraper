         UpdateWebACL .

       o Use  GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide  in  the

SYNOPSIS
            delete-web-acl
          --web-acl-id <value>
          --change-token <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --web-acl-id (string)
          The WebACLId of the  WebACL that you want to delete. WebACLId is re-
          turned by  CreateWebACL and by  ListWebACLs .

       --change-token (string)
          The value returned by the most recent call to  GetChangeToken .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ChangeToken -> (string)
          The  ChangeToken  that  you used to submit the DeleteWebACL request.
          You can also use this value to query the status of the request.  For
          more information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .
