DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Inserts or deletes RegexPatternString objects in a   RegexPatternSet  .
       For each RegexPatternString object, you specify the following values:

       o Whether to insert or delete the RegexPatternString .

       o The regular expression pattern that you want to insert or delete. For
         more information, see  RegexPatternSet .

       For example, you can create a RegexPatternString such as B[a@]dB[o0]t .
       AWS WAF will match this RegexPatternString to:

       o BadBot

       o BadB0t

       o B@dBot

       o B@dB0t

       To  create  and  configure  a  RegexPatternSet  , perform the following
       steps:

       o Create a RegexPatternSet. For more information, see   CreateRegexPat-
         ternSet .

       o Use   GetChangeToken  to get the change token that you provide in the
         ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateRegexPatternSet request.

       o Submit an UpdateRegexPatternSet request to specify  the  regular  ex-
         pression pattern that you want AWS WAF to watch for.

       For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block
       HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            update-regex-pattern-set
          --regex-pattern-set-id <value>
          --updates <value>
          --change-token <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --regex-pattern-set-id (string)
          The RegexPatternSetId of the  RegexPatternSet that you want  to  up-
          date. RegexPatternSetId is returned by  CreateRegexPatternSet and by
          ListRegexPatternSets .

       --updates (list)
          An array of RegexPatternSetUpdate objects that you  want  to  insert
          into or delete from a  RegexPatternSet .

          (structure)

              NOTE:
                 This  is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and  see  the  AWS  WAF Developer Guide . With the latest
                     version, AWS WAF has a single set of  endpoints  for  re-
                     gional and global use.

              In   an   UpdateRegexPatternSet  request,  RegexPatternSetUpdate
              specifies whether to insert or delete a  RegexPatternString  and
              includes the settings for the RegexPatternString .

              Action -> (string)
                 Specifies whether to insert or delete a RegexPatternString .

              RegexPatternString -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  regular  expression  (regex) pattern that you
                 want AWS WAF to search for, such as B[a@]dB[o0]t .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Action=string,RegexPatternString=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Action": "INSERT"|"DELETE",
              "RegexPatternString": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --change-token (string)
          The value returned by the most recent call to  GetChangeToken .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ChangeToken -> (string)
          The ChangeToken that you used to  submit  the  UpdateRegexPatternSet
          request.  You can also use this value to query the status of the re-
          quest. For more information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .
