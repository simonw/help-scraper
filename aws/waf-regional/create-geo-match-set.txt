       create-geo-match-set -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Creates an  GeoMatchSet , which you use to specify which  web  requests
       you want to allow or block based on the country that the requests orig-
       inate from. For example, if you're receiving a lot of requests from one
       or more countries and you want to block the requests, you can create an
       GeoMatchSet that contains those countries and then configure AWS WAF to
       block the requests.

       To create and configure a GeoMatchSet , perform the following steps:

       o Use   GetChangeToken  to get the change token that you provide in the
         ChangeToken parameter of a CreateGeoMatchSet request.

       o Submit a CreateGeoMatchSet request.

       o Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you  provide  in  the
         ChangeToken parameter of an  UpdateGeoMatchSet request.

       o Submit  an UpdateGeoMatchSetSet request to specify the countries that
         you want AWS WAF to watch for.

       For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block
       HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-geo-match-set
          --name <value>
          --change-token <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A  friendly  name  or  description  of  the  GeoMatchSet . You can't
          change Name after you create the GeoMatchSet .

       --change-token (string)
          The value returned by the most recent call to  GetChangeToken .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GeoMatchSet -> (structure)
          The  GeoMatchSet returned in the CreateGeoMatchSet response. The Ge-
          oMatchSet contains no GeoMatchConstraints .

          GeoMatchSetId -> (string)
              The  GeoMatchSetId for an GeoMatchSet . You use GeoMatchSetId to
              get information about a GeoMatchSet (see  GeoMatchSet ),  update
              a  GeoMatchSet  (see   UpdateGeoMatchSet ), insert a GeoMatchSet
              into a Rule or delete one from a Rule (see   UpdateRule  ),  and
              delete a GeoMatchSet from AWS WAF (see  DeleteGeoMatchSet ).
                 GeoMatchSetId is returned by  CreateGeoMatchSet and by  List-
                 GeoMatchSets .

          Name -> (string)
              A friendly name or description of the  GeoMatchSet .  You  can't
              change the name of an GeoMatchSet after you create it.

          GeoMatchConstraints -> (list)
              An array of  GeoMatchConstraint objects, which contain the coun-
              try that you want AWS WAF to search for.

                        latest  version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints
                        for regional and global use.

                 The country from which web requests originate that  you  want
                 AWS WAF to search for.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The  type of geographical area you want AWS WAF to search
                     for. Currently Country is the only valid value.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The country that you want AWS WAF to search for.

       ChangeToken -> (string)
          The ChangeToken that you used to submit  the  CreateGeoMatchSet  re-
          quest.  You  can  also use this value to query the status of the re-
          quest. For more information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .
