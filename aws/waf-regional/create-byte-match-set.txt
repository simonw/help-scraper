NAME
       create-byte-match-set -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Creates a ByteMatchSet . You then use  UpdateByteMatchSet  to  identify
       the part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect, such as the
       values of the User-Agent header or the query string. For  example,  you
       can  create  a  ByteMatchSet  that matches any requests with User-Agent
       headers that contain the string BadBot . You can then configure AWS WAF
       to reject those requests.

       To create and configure a ByteMatchSet , perform the following steps:

       o Use   GetChangeToken  to get the change token that you provide in the
         ChangeToken parameter of a CreateByteMatchSet request.

       o Submit a CreateByteMatchSet request.

       o Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you  provide  in  the
         ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateByteMatchSet request.

       o Submit  an  UpdateByteMatchSet request to specify the part of the re-
         quest that you want AWS WAF to inspect (for example,  the  header  or
         the URI) and the value that you want AWS WAF to watch for.

       For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block
       HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A friendly name or description of  the   ByteMatchSet  .  You  can't
          change Name after you create a ByteMatchSet .

       --change-token (string)
          The value returned by the most recent call to  GetChangeToken .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ByteMatchSet -> (structure)
          A  ByteMatchSet that contains no ByteMatchTuple objects.

          ByteMatchSetId -> (string)
              The  ByteMatchSetId  for a ByteMatchSet . You use ByteMatchSetId
              to get information about a ByteMatchSet (see  GetByteMatchSet ),
              update  a  ByteMatchSet  (see   UpdateByteMatchSet  ),  insert a
              ByteMatchSet into a Rule or delete one from  a  Rule  (see   Up-
              dateRule ), and delete a ByteMatchSet from AWS WAF (see  Delete-
              ByteMatchSet ).
                 ByteMatchSetId is  returned  by   CreateByteMatchSet  and  by
                 ListByteMatchSets .

          Name -> (string)
              A  friendly name or description of the  ByteMatchSet . You can't
              change Name after you create a ByteMatchSet .

          ByteMatchTuples -> (list)
              Specifies the bytes (typically a string  that  corresponds  with
              ASCII characters) that you want AWS WAF to search for in web re-
              quests, the location in  requests  that  you  want  AWS  WAF  to
              search, and other settings.

              (structure)

                 NOTE:
                     This  is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more informa-
                     tion, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                        For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2
                        API  and  see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the
                        latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of  endpoints
                        for regional and global use.

                 The  bytes  (typically  a  string that corresponds with ASCII
                 characters) that you want AWS WAF to search for  in  web  re-
                 quests,  the  location  in  requests that you want AWS WAF to
                 search, and other settings.

                 FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                     The part of a web  request  that  you  want  AWS  WAF  to
                     search, such as a specified header or a query string. For
                     more information, see  FieldToMatch .

                     Type -> (string)
                        The part of the web request that you want AWS  WAF  to
                        search for a specified string. Parts of a request that
                        you can search include the following:

                        o HEADER : A specified request  header,  for  example,
                          the  value  of  the User-Agent or Referer header. If
                          you choose HEADER for the type, specify the name  of
                          the header in Data .

                        o METHOD  :  The HTTP method, which indicated the type
                          of operation that the request is asking  the  origin
                          to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following
                          methods: DELETE , GET , HEAD ,  OPTIONS  ,  PATCH  ,
                          POST , and PUT .

                        o QUERY_STRING  : A query string, which is the part of
                          a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                        o URI : The part of a web request  that  identifies  a
                          resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                        o BODY : The part of a request that contains any addi-
                          tional data that you want to send to your web server
                          as  the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.
                          The request body  immediately  follows  the  request
                          headers.  Note that only the first 8192 bytes of the
                          request body are forwarded to AWS  WAF  for  inspec-
                          tion. To allow or block requests based on the length
                          of the body, you can create a size  constraint  set.
                          For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

                        o SINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string
                          that you will inspect, such as UserName or  SalesRe-
                          gion . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30
                          characters.

                        o ALL_QUERY_ARGS : Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG  ,  but
                          rather  than  inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF
                          will inspect all parameters within the query for the
                          value  or  regex pattern that you specify in Target-
                          String .

                     Data -> (string)
                        When the value of Type is HEADER , enter the  name  of
                        the  header that you want AWS WAF to search, for exam-
                        ple, User-Agent or Referer . The name of the header is
                        not case sensitive.

                        When the value of Type is SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , enter the
                        name of the parameter that you want AWS WAF to search,
                        for  example,  UserName or SalesRegion . The parameter
                        name is not case sensitive.

                        If the value of Type is any other value, omit Data .

                 TargetString -> (blob)
                     The value that you want AWS WAF to search  for.  AWS  WAF
                     searches  for the specified string in the part of web re-
                     quests that you specified in FieldToMatch .  The  maximum
                     length of the value is 50 bytes.

                     Valid  values depend on the values that you specified for
                     FieldToMatch :

                     o HEADER : The value that you want AWS WAF to search  for
                       in  the  request  header  that you specified in  Field-
                       ToMatch , for example, the value of the  User-Agent  or
                       Referer header.

                     o METHOD  :  The HTTP method, which indicates the type of
                       operation specified in the request. CloudFront supports
                       the  following methods: DELETE , GET , HEAD , OPTIONS ,
                       PATCH , POST , and PUT .

                     o QUERY_STRING : The value  that  you  want  AWS  WAF  to
                       search  for in the query string, which is the part of a
                       URL that appears after a ? character.

                     o URI : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for  in
                       the part of a URL that identifies a resource, for exam-
                       ple, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                     o BODY : The part of a request that  contains  any  addi-
                       tional data that you want to send to your web server as
                       the HTTP request body, such as data from  a  form.  The
                       request  body  immediately follows the request headers.
                       Note that only the first 8192 bytes of the request body
                       are  forwarded  to  AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or
                       block requests based on the length of the body, you can
                       create a size constraint set. For more information, see
                       CreateSizeConstraintSet .

                     o SINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in  the  query  string
                       that  you will inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion
                       . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30 charac-
                       ters.

                     o ALL_QUERY_ARGS  : Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , but in-
                       stead of inspecting a single  parameter,  AWS  WAF  in-
                       spects  all  parameters within the query string for the
                       value or regex pattern that you specify in TargetString
                       .

                     If  TargetString  includes  alphabetic characters A-Z and
                     a-z, note that the value is case sensitive.
                        If you're using the AWS WAF API

                     Specify a base64-encoded version of the value. The  maxi-
                     mum length of the value before you base64-encode it is 50
                     bytes.

                     For example, suppose the value of Type is HEADER and  the
                     value  of  Data is User-Agent . If you want to search the
                     User-Agent header for the value BadBot ,  you  base64-en-
                     code  BadBot  using  MIME base64-encoding and include the
                     resulting value, QmFkQm90 , in the value of  TargetString
                     .
                        If you're using the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs

                     The  value  that  you want AWS WAF to search for. The SDK
                     automatically base64 encodes the value.

                 TextTransformation -> (string)
                     Text transformations eliminate some of the  unusual  for-
                     matting  that  attackers use in web requests in an effort
                     to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a  transformation,  AWS
                     WAF  performs  the  transformation on FieldToMatch before
                     inspecting it for a match.

                     You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.
                        CMD_LINE

                     When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an op-
                     erating  system  command  line  command and using unusual
                     formatting to disguise some or all of  the  command,  use
                     this option to perform the following transformations:

                     o Delete the following characters: " ' ^

                     o Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

                     o Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

                     o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                     o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)
                        COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE

                     Use  this option to replace the following characters with
                     a space character (decimal 32):

                     o f, formfeed, decimal 12

                     o t, tab, decimal 9

                     o n, newline, decimal 10

                     o r, carriage return, decimal 13

                     o v, vertical tab, decimal 11

                     o non-breaking space, decimal 160
                        COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also  replaces  multiple  spaces
                        with one space.

                        HTML_ENTITY_DECODE

                     Use  this  option to replace HTML-encoded characters with
                     unencoded  characters.  HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  performs  the
                     following operations:

                     o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                     o Replaces  (ampersand)nbsp;  with  a non-breaking space,
                       decimal 160

                     o Replaces (ampersand)lt; with a "less than" symbol

                     o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                     o Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal
                       format,  (ampersand)#xhhhh;  ,  with  the corresponding
                       characters

                     o Replaces characters that  are  represented  in  decimal
                       format,  (ampersand)#nnnn;  ,  with  the  corresponding
                       characters
                        LOWERCASE
