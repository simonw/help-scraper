       create-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Creates a Rule , which contains the  IPSet  objects,  ByteMatchSet  ob-
       jects, and other predicates that identify the requests that you want to
       block. If you add more than one predicate to a Rule ,  a  request  must
       match  all of the specifications to be allowed or blocked. For example,
       suppose that you add the following to a Rule :

       o An IPSet that matches the IP address 192.0.2.44/32

       o A ByteMatchSet that matches BadBot in the User-Agent header

       You then add the Rule to a WebACL and specify that you want  to  blocks
       requests  that  satisfy the Rule . For a request to be blocked, it must
       come from the IP address 192.0.2.44 and the User-Agent  header  in  the
       request must contain the value BadBot .

       To create and configure a Rule , perform the following steps:

       o Create and update the predicates that you want to include in the Rule
         . For more information, see  CreateByteMatchSet ,  CreateIPSet ,  and
         CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet .

       o Use   GetChangeToken  to get the change token that you provide in the
         ChangeToken parameter of a CreateRule request.

       o Submit a CreateRule request.

       o Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you  provide  in  the
         ChangeToken parameter of an  UpdateRule request.

       o Submit  an UpdateRule request to specify the predicates that you want
         to include in the Rule .

       o Create and update a WebACL that contains the Rule . For more informa-
         tion, see  CreateWebACL .

       For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block
       HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide .

          space or metric names reserved for AWS WAF, including "All" and "De-
          fault_Action."  You  can't  change  the name of the metric after you
          create the Rule .

       --change-token (string)

          (structure)

              NOTE:
                 This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide  .  With  the  latest
                     version,  AWS  WAF  has a single set of endpoints for re-
                     gional and global use.

              A tag associated with an AWS resource. Tags are key:value  pairs
              that  you  can  use to categorize and manage your resources, for
              purposes like billing. For example, you might set the tag key to
              "customer"  and  the  value  to the customer name or ID. You can
              specify one or more tags to add to each AWS resource, up  to  50
              tags for a resource.

              Tagging  is  only  available through the API, SDKs, and CLI. You
              can't manage or view tags through the AWS WAF  Classic  console.
              You  can  tag  the AWS resources that you manage through AWS WAF
              Classic: web ACLs, rule groups, and rules.

              Key -> (string)

              Value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Rule -> (structure)
          The  Rule returned in the CreateRule response.

          RuleId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for a Rule . You use RuleId to get more  in-
              formation  about a Rule (see  GetRule ), update a Rule (see  Up-
              dateRule ), insert a Rule into a WebACL or delete a one  from  a
              WebACL  (see  UpdateWebACL ), or delete a Rule from AWS WAF (see
              DeleteRule ).
                 RuleId is returned by  CreateRule and by  ListRules .

          Name -> (string)
              The friendly name or description for the Rule . You can't change
              the name of a Rule after you create it.

          MetricName -> (string)
              A  friendly  name or description for the metrics for this Rule .
              The name can contain only  alphanumeric  characters  (A-Z,  a-z,
              0-9),  with  maximum length 128 and minimum length one. It can't
              contain whitespace or metric names reserved for AWS WAF, includ-
              ing  "All" and "Default_Action." You can't change MetricName af-
              ter you create the Rule .

          Predicates -> (list)
              The Predicates object contains one Predicate  element  for  each
              ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet , or  SqlInjectionMatchSet object that you
              want to include in a Rule .

              (structure)

                 NOTE:
                     This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  informa-
                     tion, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                        For  the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2
                        API and see the AWS WAF Developer  Guide  .  With  the
                        latest  version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints
                        for regional and global use.

                 Specifies the  ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet ,   SqlInjectionMatchSet
                 ,   XssMatchSet  ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet , and  Size-
                 ConstraintSet objects that you want to add to a Rule and, for
                 each  object,  indicates  whether you want to negate the set-
                 tings, for example, requests that do NOT originate  from  the
                 IP address 192.0.2.44.

                 Negated -> (boolean)
                     Set Negated to False if you want AWS WAF to allow, block,
                     or count requests based on the settings in the  specified
                     ByteMatchSet  ,   IPSet  ,   SqlInjectionMatchSet ,  Xss-
                     MatchSet ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet ,  or   SizeCon-
                     straintSet . For example, if an IPSet includes the IP ad-
                     dress 192.0.2.44 , AWS WAF will allow or  block  requests
                     based on that IP address.

                     Set Negated to True if you want AWS WAF to allow or block
                     a request based on the negation of the  settings  in  the
                     ByteMatchSet  ,   IPSet  ,   SqlInjectionMatchSet ,  Xss-
                     MatchSet ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet ,  or   SizeCon-
                     straintSet . For example, if an IPSet includes the IP ad-
                     dress 192.0.2.44 , AWS WAF will allow,  block,  or  count
                     requests based on all IP addresses except  192.0.2.44 .

                 Type -> (string)
                     The  type  of  predicate in a Rule , such as ByteMatch or
                     IPSet .

                 DataId -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for a predicate in a Rule ,  such  as
                     ByteMatchSetId  or  IPSetId  .  The ID is returned by the
                     corresponding Create or List command.

       ChangeToken -> (string)
          The ChangeToken that you used to submit the CreateRule request.  You
          can also use this value to query the status of the request. For more
          information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .
