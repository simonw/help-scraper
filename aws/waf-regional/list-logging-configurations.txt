DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns an array of  LoggingConfiguration objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-logging-configurations
          [--next-marker <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-marker (string)
          If you specify a value for Limit and you have more LoggingConfigura-
          tions  than  the value of Limit , AWS WAF returns a NextMarker value
          in the response that allows you to list another group of LoggingCon-
          figurations  .  For  the second and subsequent ListLoggingConfigura-
          tions requests, specify the value of NextMarker  from  the  previous
          response  to  get information about another batch of ListLoggingCon-
          figurations .

       --limit (integer)
          Specifies the number of LoggingConfigurations that you want AWS  WAF
          to  return  for this request. If you have more LoggingConfigurations
          than the number that you specify for Limit , the response includes a
          NextMarker  value  that you can use to get another batch of Logging-
          Configurations .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LoggingConfigurations -> (list)
          An array of  LoggingConfiguration objects.

                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and  see  the  AWS  WAF Developer Guide . With the latest
                     version, AWS WAF has a single set of  endpoints  for  re-
                     gional and global use.

              The  Amazon  Kinesis  Data Firehose, RedactedFields information,
              and the web ACL Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the web ACL that  you  want
                 to associate with LogDestinationConfigs .

              LogDestinationConfigs -> (list)
                 An array of Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose ARNs.

                 (string)

              RedactedFields -> (list)
                 The  parts  of  the  request  that you want redacted from the
                 logs. For example, if you redact the cookie field, the cookie
                 field in the firehose will be xxx .

                        mation, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                            For the latest version of AWS WAF ,  use  the  AWS
                            WAFV2  API  and  see the AWS WAF Developer Guide .
                            With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single  set
                            of endpoints for regional and global use.

                     Specifies where in a web request to look for TargetString
                     .

                     Type -> (string)
                        The part of the web request that you want AWS  WAF  to
                        search for a specified string. Parts of a request that
                        you can search include the following:

                        o HEADER : A specified request  header,  for  example,
                          the  value  of  the User-Agent or Referer header. If
                          you choose HEADER for the type, specify the name  of
                          the header in Data .

                        o METHOD  :  The HTTP method, which indicated the type
                          of operation that the request is asking  the  origin
                          to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following
                          methods: DELETE , GET , HEAD ,  OPTIONS  ,  PATCH  ,
                          POST , and PUT .

                        o QUERY_STRING  : A query string, which is the part of
                          a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                        o URI : The part of a web request  that  identifies  a
                          resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                        o BODY : The part of a request that contains any addi-
                          tional data that you want to send to your web server
                          as  the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.
                          The request body  immediately  follows  the  request
                          headers.  Note that only the first 8192 bytes of the
                          request body are forwarded to AWS  WAF  for  inspec-
                          tion. To allow or block requests based on the length
                          of the body, you can create a size  constraint  set.
                          For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

                        o SINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string
                          that you will inspect, such as UserName or  SalesRe-
                          gion . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30
                          characters.

                        o ALL_QUERY_ARGS : Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG  ,  but
                          rather  than  inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF
                          will inspect all parameters within the query for the
                          value  or  regex pattern that you specify in Target-
                          String .

                     Data -> (string)
                        When the value of Type is HEADER , enter the  name  of
                        the  header that you want AWS WAF to search, for exam-
                        ple, User-Agent or Referer . The name of the header is
                        not case sensitive.

                        When the value of Type is SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , enter the
                        name of the parameter that you want AWS WAF to search,
                        for  example,  UserName or SalesRegion . The parameter
                        name is not case sensitive.

                        If the value of Type is any other value, omit Data .

       NextMarker -> (string)
          If you have more LoggingConfigurations  than  the  number  that  you
          specified  for  Limit  in  the  request,  the  response  includes  a
          NextMarker value. To list more LoggingConfigurations  ,  submit  an-
          other  ListLoggingConfigurations request, and specify the NextMarker
          value from the response in the NextMarker value in the next request.
