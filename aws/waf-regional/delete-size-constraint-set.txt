DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Permanently deletes a  SizeConstraintSet . You can't delete a  SizeCon-
       straintSet  if it's still used in any Rules or if it still includes any
       SizeConstraint objects (any filters).

       If you just want to remove a SizeConstraintSet from a Rule ,  use   Up-
       dateRule .

       To  permanently  delete  a  SizeConstraintSet  ,  perform the following
       steps:

       o Update the SizeConstraintSet to remove filters, if any. For more  in-
         formation, see  UpdateSizeConstraintSet .

       o Use   GetChangeToken  to get the change token that you provide in the
         ChangeToken parameter of a DeleteSizeConstraintSet request.

       o Submit a DeleteSizeConstraintSet request.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-size-constraint-set
          --size-constraint-set-id <value>
          --change-token <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --size-constraint-set-id (string)
          The SizeConstraintSetId of the  SizeConstraintSet that you  want  to
          delete.  SizeConstraintSetId is returned by  CreateSizeConstraintSet
          and by  ListSizeConstraintSets .

       --change-token (string)
          The value returned by the most recent call to  GetChangeToken .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ChangeToken -> (string)
          The  ChangeToken that you used to submit the DeleteSizeConstraintSet
          request. You can also use this value to query the status of the  re-
          quest. For more information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .
