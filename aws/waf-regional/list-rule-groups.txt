DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns an array of  RuleGroup objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-rule-groups
          [--next-marker <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-marker (string)
          If you specify a value for Limit and you have more  RuleGroups  than
          the  value  of Limit , AWS WAF returns a NextMarker value in the re-
          sponse that allows you to list another group of RuleGroups . For the
          second  and subsequent ListRuleGroups requests, specify the value of
          NextMarker from the previous response to get information  about  an-
          other batch of RuleGroups .

       --limit (integer)
          Specifies  the  number of RuleGroups that you want AWS WAF to return
          for this request. If you have more RuleGroups than the  number  that
          you  specify  for  Limit  , the response includes a NextMarker value
          that you can use to get another batch of RuleGroups .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextMarker -> (string)
          If  you  have more RuleGroups than the number that you specified for
          Limit in the request, the response includes a NextMarker  value.  To
          list  more  RuleGroups  , submit another ListRuleGroups request, and
          specify the NextMarker value from the  response  in  the  NextMarker
          value in the next request.

       RuleGroups -> (list)
          An array of  RuleGroup objects.

              NOTE:
                 This  is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and  see  the  AWS  WAF Developer Guide . With the latest
                     version, AWS WAF has a single set of  endpoints  for  re-
                     gional and global use.

              Contains  the identifier and the friendly name or description of
              the RuleGroup .

              RuleGroupId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for a RuleGroup . You use RuleGroupId  to
                 get  more information about a RuleGroup (see  GetRuleGroup ),
                 update a RuleGroup (see  UpdateRuleGroup ),  insert  a  Rule-
                 Group  into  a  WebACL  or delete one from a WebACL (see  Up-
                 dateWebACL ),  or  delete  a  RuleGroup  from  AWS  WAF  (see
                 DeleteRuleGroup ).
                     RuleGroupId   is  returned  by   CreateRuleGroup  and  by
                     ListRuleGroups .

              Name -> (string)
                 A friendly name or description of the  RuleGroup . You  can't
                 change the name of a RuleGroup after you create it.
