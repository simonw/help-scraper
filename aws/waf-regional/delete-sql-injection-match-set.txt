DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Permanently deletes a  SqlInjectionMatchSet . You can't delete a SqlIn-
       jectionMatchSet if it's still used in any Rules or if it still contains
       any  SqlInjectionMatchTuple objects.

       If you just want to remove a SqlInjectionMatchSet from  a  Rule  ,  use
       UpdateRule .

       To  permanently delete a SqlInjectionMatchSet from AWS WAF, perform the
       following steps:

       o Update the SqlInjectionMatchSet to remove filters, if any.  For  more
         information, see  UpdateSqlInjectionMatchSet .

       o Use   GetChangeToken  to get the change token that you provide in the
         ChangeToken parameter of a DeleteSqlInjectionMatchSet request.

       o Submit a DeleteSqlInjectionMatchSet request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-sql-injection-match-set
          --sql-injection-match-set-id <value>
          --change-token <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --sql-injection-match-set-id (string)
          The SqlInjectionMatchSetId of  the   SqlInjectionMatchSet  that  you
          want  to delete. SqlInjectionMatchSetId is returned by  CreateSqlIn-
          jectionMatchSet and by  ListSqlInjectionMatchSets .

       --change-token (string)
          The value returned by the most recent call to  GetChangeToken .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ChangeToken -> (string)
          The ChangeToken that you used to submit the DeleteSqlInjectionMatch-
          Set  request. You can also use this value to query the status of the
          request. For more information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .
