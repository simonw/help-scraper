DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns an array of  GeoMatchSetSummary objects in the response.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-geo-match-sets
          [--next-marker <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-marker (string)
          If you specify a value for Limit and you  have  more  GeoMatchSet  s
          than  the value of Limit , AWS WAF returns a NextMarker value in the
          response that allows you to list another group  of  GeoMatchSet  ob-
          jects.  For  the  second  and  subsequent ListGeoMatchSets requests,
          specify the value of NextMarker from the previous  response  to  get
          information about another batch of GeoMatchSet objects.

       --limit (integer)
          Specifies the number of GeoMatchSet objects that you want AWS WAF to
          return for this request. If you have more GeoMatchSet  objects  than
          the  number  you  specify  for  Limit  ,  the  response  includes  a
          NextMarker value that you can use to get another batch of  GeoMatch-
          Set objects.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextMarker -> (string)
          If you have more GeoMatchSet objects than the number that you speci-
          fied  for  Limit  in the request, the response includes a NextMarker
          value. To list more GeoMatchSet  objects,  submit  another  ListGeo-
          MatchSets  request,  and  specify  the NextMarker value from the re-
          sponse in the NextMarker value in the next request.

       GeoMatchSets -> (list)
          An array of  GeoMatchSetSummary objects.

              Contains the identifier and the name of the GeoMatchSet .

              GeoMatchSetId -> (string)
                 The GeoMatchSetId for an  GeoMatchSet . You can use GeoMatch-
                 SetId  in  a  GetGeoMatchSet request to get detailed informa-
                 tion about an  GeoMatchSet .

              Name -> (string)
                 A friendly name or description  of  the   GeoMatchSet  .  You
