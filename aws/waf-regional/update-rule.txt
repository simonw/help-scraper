NAME
       update-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Inserts or deletes  Predicate objects in a Rule . Each Predicate object
       identifies  a  predicate,  such  as a  ByteMatchSet or an  IPSet , that
       specifies the web requests that you want to allow, block, or count.  If
       you add more than one predicate to a Rule , a request must match all of
       the specifications to be allowed, blocked,  or  counted.  For  example,
       suppose that you add the following to a Rule :

       o A ByteMatchSet that matches the value BadBot in the User-Agent header

       o An IPSet that matches the IP address 192.0.2.44

       You  then  add  the Rule to a WebACL and specify that you want to block
       requests that satisfy the Rule . For  a  request  to  be  blocked,  the
       User-Agent header in the request must contain the value BadBot  and the
       request must originate from the IP address 192.0.2.44.

       To create and configure a Rule , perform the following steps:

       o Create and update the predicates that you want to include in the Rule
         .

       o Create the Rule . See  CreateRule .

       o Use  GetChangeToken  to  get the change token that you provide in the
         ChangeToken parameter of an  UpdateRule request.

       o Submit an UpdateRule request to add predicates to the Rule .

       o Create and update a WebACL that contains the Rule . See  CreateWebACL
         .

       If  you  want  to  replace  one ByteMatchSet or IPSet with another, you
       delete the existing one and add the new one.

       For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block
       HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide .

              NOTE:
                 This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide  .  With  the  latest
                     version,  AWS  WAF  has a single set of endpoints for re-
                     gional and global use.

              Specifies a Predicate (such as an IPSet ) and indicates  whether
              you want to add it to a Rule or delete it from a Rule .

              Action -> (string)
                 Specify  INSERT  to add a Predicate to a Rule . Use DELETE to
                 remove a Predicate from a Rule .

              Predicate -> (structure)
                 The ID of the Predicate (such as an IPSet ) that you want  to
                 add to a Rule .

                 Negated -> (boolean)
                     Set Negated to False if you want AWS WAF to allow, block,
                     or count requests based on the settings in the  specified
                     ByteMatchSet  ,   IPSet  ,   SqlInjectionMatchSet ,  Xss-
                     MatchSet ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet ,  or   SizeCon-
                     straintSet . For example, if an IPSet includes the IP ad-
                     dress 192.0.2.44 , AWS WAF will allow or  block  requests
                     based on that IP address.

                     Set Negated to True if you want AWS WAF to allow or block
                     a request based on the negation of the  settings  in  the
                     ByteMatchSet  ,   IPSet  ,   SqlInjectionMatchSet ,  Xss-
                     MatchSet ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet ,  or   SizeCon-
                     straintSet . For example, if an IPSet includes the IP ad-
                     dress 192.0.2.44 , AWS WAF will allow,  block,  or  count
                     requests based on all IP addresses except  192.0.2.44 .

                 Type -> (string)
                     The  type  of  predicate in a Rule , such as ByteMatch or
                     IPSet .

                 DataId -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for a predicate in a Rule ,  such  as
                     ByteMatchSetId  or  IPSetId  .  The ID is returned by the
                     corresponding Create or List command.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Action=string,Predicate={Negated=boolean,Type=string,DataId=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Action": "INSERT"|"DELETE",
              "Predicate": {
                "Negated": true|false,
                "Type": "IPMatch"|"ByteMatch"|"SqlInjectionMatch"|"GeoMatch"|"SizeConstraint"|"XssMatch"|"RegexMatch",
                "DataId": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update a rule

       The  following  update-rule  command   deletes  a Predicate object in a
       rule. Because the updates value has embedded double  quotes,  you  must
       surround the entire value with single quotes.

          aws waf-regional update-rule \
              --rule-id a123fae4-b567-8e90-1234-5ab67ac8ca90 \
              --change-token 12cs345-67cd-890b-1cd2-c3a4567d89f1 \
              --updates 'Action="DELETE",Predicate={Negated=false,Type="ByteMatch",DataId="MyByteMatchSetID"}'

       For  more  information, see Working with Rules in the AWS WAF Developer
       Guide .

OUTPUT
       ChangeToken -> (string)
          The ChangeToken that you used to submit the UpdateRule request.  You
          can also use this value to query the status of the request. For more
          information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .
