DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns an array of  RuleSummary objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-rules
          [--next-marker <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-marker (string)
          If you specify a value for Limit and you have more  Rules  than  the
          value  of Limit , AWS WAF returns a NextMarker value in the response
          that allows you to list another group of Rules . For the second  and
          subsequent  ListRules requests, specify the value of NextMarker from
          the previous response to get  information  about  another  batch  of
          Rules .

       --limit (integer)
          Specifies  the  number  of Rules that you want AWS WAF to return for
          this request. If you have more Rules than the number that you  spec-
          ify  for  Limit  , the response includes a NextMarker value that you
          can use to get another batch of Rules .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextMarker -> (string)
          If you have more Rules than the number that you specified for  Limit
          in  the  request,  the response includes a NextMarker value. To list
          more Rules , submit  another  ListRules  request,  and  specify  the
          NextMarker  value  from  the response in the NextMarker value in the
          next request.

       Rules -> (list)
          An array of  RuleSummary objects.

                 This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide  .  With  the  latest
                     version,  AWS  WAF  has a single set of endpoints for re-
                     gional and global use.

              Contains the identifier and the friendly name or description  of
              the Rule .

              RuleId -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier for a Rule . You use RuleId to get more
                 information about a Rule (see  GetRule ), update a Rule  (see
                 UpdateRule  ), insert a Rule into a WebACL or delete one from
                 a WebACL (see  UpdateWebACL ), or delete a Rule from AWS  WAF
                 (see  DeleteRule ).
                     RuleId is returned by  CreateRule and by  ListRules .

              Name -> (string)
                 A  friendly  name  or  description  of  the  Rule . You can't
                 change the name of a Rule after you create it.
