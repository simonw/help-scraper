DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Inserts or deletes  IPSetDescriptor objects in  an  IPSet  .  For  each
       IPSetDescriptor object, you specify the following values:

       o Whether to insert or delete the object from the array. If you want to
         change an IPSetDescriptor object, you delete the existing object  and
         add a new one.

       o The IP address version, IPv4 or IPv6 .

       o The  IP  address in CIDR notation, for example, 192.0.2.0/24 (for the
         range  of  IP  addresses  from  192.0.2.0   to   192.0.2.255   )   or
         192.0.2.44/32 (for the individual IP address 192.0.2.44 ).

       AWS  WAF  supports  IPv4  address  ranges: /8 and any range between /16
       through /32. AWS WAF supports IPv6 address ranges: /24, /32, /48,  /56,
       /64,  and  /128.  For  more  information  about  CIDR notation, see the
       Wikipedia entry Classless Inter-Domain Routing .

       IPv6 addresses can be represented using any of the following formats:

       o 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128

       o 1111:0:0:0:0:0:0:0111/128

       o 1111::0111/128

       o 1111::111/128

       You use an IPSet to specify which web requests you  want  to  allow  or
       block  based on the IP addresses that the requests originated from. For
       example, if you're receiving a lot of requests from one or a small num-
       ber  of IP addresses and you want to block the requests, you can create
       an IPSet that specifies those IP addresses, and then configure AWS  WAF
       to block the requests.

       To create and configure an IPSet , perform the following steps:

       o Submit a  CreateIPSet request.

       o Use   GetChangeToken  to get the change token that you provide in the
         ChangeToken parameter of an  UpdateIPSet request.

       o Submit an UpdateIPSet request to specify the IP  addresses  that  you
         want AWS WAF to watch for.

       When  you  update an IPSet , you specify the IP addresses that you want
       to add and/or the IP addresses that you want to delete. If you want  to
       change  an  IP  address, you delete the existing IP address and add the
       new one.

       You can insert a maximum of 1000 addresses in a single request.

       For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block
       HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide .

       --updates (list)
          An array of IPSetUpdate objects that you  want  to  insert  into  or
          delete  from  an   IPSet  . For more information, see the applicable
          data types:

          o IPSetUpdate : Contains Action and IPSetDescriptor

          o IPSetDescriptor : Contains Type and Value

          You can insert a maximum of 1000 addresses in a single request.

                 The IP address type (IPV4 or IPV6 ) and the IP address  range
                 (in CIDR notation) that web requests originate from.

                 Type -> (string)

                 Value -> (string)

                     o To configure AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests
                       that     originated     from     the     IP     address

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Action=string,IPSetDescriptor={Type=string,Value=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Action": "INSERT"|"DELETE",
              "IPSetDescriptor": {
                "Type": "IPV4"|"IPV6",
                "Value": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update an IP set

       The  following  update-ip-set command updates an IPSet with an IPv4 ad-
       dress and deletes an IPv6 address. Get the value  for  change-token  by
       running the get-change-token command. Because the value for updates in-
       cludes embedded double-quotes, you must surround the value with  single
       quotes.

          aws waf update-ip-set \
              --ip-set-id a123fae4-b567-8e90-1234-5ab67ac8ca90 \
              --change-token 12cs345-67cd-890b-1cd2-c3a4567d89f1 \
              --updates 'Action="INSERT",IPSetDescriptor={Type="IPV4",Value="12.34.56.78/16"},Action="DELETE",IPSetDescriptor={Type="IPV6",Value="1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128"}'

       Alternatively  you  can use a JSON file to specify the input. For exam-
       ple:

          aws waf-regional update-ip-set \
              --ip-set-id a123fae4-b567-8e90-1234-5ab67ac8ca90 \
              --change-token 12cs345-67cd-890b-1cd2-c3a4567d89f1  \
              --updates file://change.json

       Content of the change.json

          [
              {
                  "Action": "INSERT",
                  "IPSetDescriptor":
                  {
                      "Type": "IPV4",
                      "Value": "12.34.56.78/16"
                  }
              },
              {
                  "Action": "DELETE",
                  "IPSetDescriptor":
                  {
                      "Type": "IPV6",
                      "Value": "1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128"
                  }
              }
          ]

       WAF Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       ChangeToken -> (string)
          The ChangeToken that you used to submit the UpdateIPSet request. You
          can also use this value to query the status of the request. For more
          information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .
