DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns an array of  RuleGroup objects that you are subscribed to.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-subscribed-rule-groups
          [--next-marker <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-marker (string)
          If you specify a value for Limit and  you  have  more  ByteMatchSets
          subscribed  rule  groups than the value of Limit , AWS WAF returns a
          NextMarker value in the response that allows  you  to  list  another
          group of subscribed rule groups. For the second and subsequent List-
          SubscribedRuleGroupsRequest   requests,   specify   the   value   of
          NextMarker  from  the previous response to get information about an-
          other batch of subscribed rule groups.

       --limit (integer)
          Specifies the number of subscribed rule groups that you want AWS WAF
          to return for this request. If you have more objects than the number
          you specify for Limit , the response  includes  a  NextMarker  value
          that you can use to get another batch of objects.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextMarker -> (string)
          If  you  have  more  objects  than the number that you specified for
          Limit in the request, the response includes a NextMarker  value.  To
          list  more objects, submit another ListSubscribedRuleGroups request,
          and specify the NextMarker value from the response in the NextMarker
          value in the next request.

       RuleGroups -> (list)
          An array of  RuleGroup objects.

              MetricName -> (string)
                 A friendly name or description for the metrics for this Rule-
