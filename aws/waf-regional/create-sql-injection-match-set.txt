       create-sql-injection-match-set -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Creates a  SqlInjectionMatchSet , which you use  to  allow,  block,  or
       count requests that contain snippets of SQL code in a specified part of
       web requests. AWS WAF searches for character sequences that are  likely
       to be malicious strings.

       To  create and configure a SqlInjectionMatchSet , perform the following
       steps:

       o Use  GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide  in  the
         ChangeToken parameter of a CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet request.

       o Submit a CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet request.

       o Use  GetChangeToken  to  get the change token that you provide in the
         ChangeToken parameter of an  UpdateSqlInjectionMatchSet request.

       o Submit an  UpdateSqlInjectionMatchSet request to specify the parts of
         web  requests  in  which you want to allow, block, or count malicious
         SQL code.

       For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block
       HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A  friendly  name  or description for the  SqlInjectionMatchSet that
          you're creating. You can't change Name after you create  the  SqlIn-
          jectionMatchSet .

       --change-token (string)
          The value returned by the most recent call to  GetChangeToken .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       SqlInjectionMatchSet -> (structure)
          A  SqlInjectionMatchSet .

          SqlInjectionMatchSetId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for a SqlInjectionMatchSet . You use  SqlIn-
              jectionMatchSetId  to get information about a SqlInjectionMatch-
              Set (see  GetSqlInjectionMatchSet ), update a SqlInjectionMatch-
              Set  (see   UpdateSqlInjectionMatchSet ), insert a SqlInjection-
              MatchSet into a Rule or delete one from a Rule (see   UpdateRule
              ),   and   delete  a  SqlInjectionMatchSet  from  AWS  WAF  (see
              DeleteSqlInjectionMatchSet ).
                 SqlInjectionMatchSetId is  returned  by   CreateSqlInjection-
                 MatchSet and by  ListSqlInjectionMatchSets .

          Name -> (string)
              The name, if any, of the SqlInjectionMatchSet .

          SqlInjectionMatchTuples -> (list)
              Specifies the parts of web requests that you want to inspect for
              snippets of malicious SQL code.

              (structure)

                 NOTE:
                     This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  informa-
                     tion, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                        For  the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2
                        API and see the AWS WAF Developer  Guide  .  With  the
                        latest  version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints
                        for regional and global use.

                 Specifies the part of a web request that you want AWS WAF  to
                 inspect  for  snippets of malicious SQL code and, if you want
                 AWS WAF to inspect a header, the name of the header.

                 FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                     Specifies where in a web request to look for snippets  of
                     malicious SQL code.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The  part  of the web request that you want AWS WAF to
                        search for a specified string. Parts of a request that
                        you can search include the following:

                        o HEADER  :  A  specified request header, for example,
                          the value of the User-Agent or  Referer  header.  If
                          you  choose HEADER for the type, specify the name of
                          the header in Data .

                        o METHOD : The HTTP method, which indicated  the  type
                          of  operation  that the request is asking the origin
                          to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following
                          methods:  DELETE  ,  GET  , HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH ,
                          POST , and PUT .

                        o QUERY_STRING : A query string, which is the part  of
                          a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                        o URI  :  The  part of a web request that identifies a
                          resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                        o BODY : The part of a request that contains any addi-
                          tional data that you want to send to your web server
                          as the HTTP request body, such as data from a  form.
                          The  request  body  immediately  follows the request
                          headers. Note that only the first 8192 bytes of  the
                          request  body  are  forwarded to AWS WAF for inspec-
                          tion. To allow or block requests based on the length
                          of  the  body, you can create a size constraint set.
                          For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

                        o SINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string
                          that  you will inspect, such as UserName or SalesRe-
                          gion . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30
                          characters.

                        o ALL_QUERY_ARGS  :  Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , but
                          rather than inspecting a single parameter,  AWS  WAF
                          will inspect all parameters within the query for the
                          value or regex pattern that you specify  in  Target-
                          String .

                     Data -> (string)
                        When  the  value of Type is HEADER , enter the name of
                        the header that you want AWS WAF to search, for  exam-
                        ple, User-Agent or Referer . The name of the header is
                        not case sensitive.

                        When the value of Type is SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , enter the
                        name of the parameter that you want AWS WAF to search,
                        for example, UserName or SalesRegion .  The  parameter
                        name is not case sensitive.

                        If the value of Type is any other value, omit Data .

                 TextTransformation -> (string)
                     Text  transformations  eliminate some of the unusual for-
                     matting that attackers use in web requests in  an  effort
                     to  bypass  AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS
                     WAF performs the transformation  on  FieldToMatch  before
                     inspecting it for a match.

                     You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.
                        CMD_LINE

                     When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an op-
                     erating system command line  command  and  using  unusual
                     formatting  to  disguise  some or all of the command, use
                     this option to perform the following transformations:

                     o Delete the following characters: " ' ^

                     o Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

                     o Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

                     o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                     o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)
                        COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE

                     Use this option to replace the following characters  with
                     a space character (decimal 32):

                     o f, formfeed, decimal 12

                     o t, tab, decimal 9

                     o n, newline, decimal 10

                     o r, carriage return, decimal 13

                     o v, vertical tab, decimal 11

                     o non-breaking space, decimal 160
                        COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also  replaces  multiple  spaces
                        with one space.

                        HTML_ENTITY_DECODE

                     Use this option to replace HTML-encoded  characters  with
                     unencoded  characters.  HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  performs  the
                     following operations:

                     o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                     o Replaces (ampersand)nbsp; with  a  non-breaking  space,
                       decimal 160

                     o Replaces (ampersand)lt; with a "less than" symbol

                     o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                     o Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal
                       format, (ampersand)#xhhhh;  ,  with  the  corresponding
                       characters

                     o Replaces  characters  that  are  represented in decimal
                       format,  (ampersand)#nnnn;  ,  with  the  corresponding
                       characters
                        LOWERCASE

                     Use  this  option  to  convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to
                     lowercase (a-z).
                        URL_DECODE

                     Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.
                        NONE

                     Specify NONE if you don't want to perform any text trans-
                     formations.

       ChangeToken -> (string)
          The ChangeToken that you used to submit the CreateSqlInjectionMatch-
          Set request. You can also use this value to query the status of  the
          request. For more information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .
