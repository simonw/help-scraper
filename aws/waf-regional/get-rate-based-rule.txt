DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns the  RateBasedRule that is specified by the RuleId that you in-
       cluded in the GetRateBasedRule request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-rate-based-rule
          --rule-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rule-id (string)
          The RuleId of the  RateBasedRule that you want to get. RuleId is re-
          turned by  CreateRateBasedRule and by  ListRateBasedRules .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Rule -> (structure)
          Information  about  the  RateBasedRule that you specified in the Ge-
          tRateBasedRule request.

          RuleId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for a RateBasedRule . You use RuleId to  get
              more information about a RateBasedRule (see  GetRateBasedRule ),
              update a RateBasedRule (see   UpdateRateBasedRule  ),  insert  a
              RateBasedRule  into  a  WebACL  or delete one from a WebACL (see
              UpdateWebACL ), or delete a  RateBasedRule  from  AWS  WAF  (see
              DeleteRateBasedRule ).

          Name -> (string)
              A  friendly  name or description for a RateBasedRule . You can't
              change the name of a RateBasedRule after you create it.

          MetricName -> (string)
              A friendly name or description for the metrics for  a  RateBase-
              dRule  . The name can contain only alphanumeric characters (A-Z,
              a-z, 0-9), with maximum length 128 and minimum  length  one.  It
              can't  contain  whitespace or metric names reserved for AWS WAF,
              including "All" and "Default_Action." You can't change the  name
              of the metric after you create the RateBasedRule .

          MatchPredicates -> (list)
              The  Predicates  object  contains one Predicate element for each
              ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet , or  SqlInjectionMatchSet object that you
              want to include in a RateBasedRule .

              (structure)

                 NOTE:
                     This  is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more informa-
                     tion, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                        For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2
                        API  and  see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the
                        latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of  endpoints
                        for regional and global use.

                 Specifies  the  ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet ,  SqlInjectionMatchSet
                 ,  XssMatchSet ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet ,  and   Size-
                 ConstraintSet objects that you want to add to a Rule and, for
                 each object, indicates whether you want to  negate  the  set-
                 tings,  for  example, requests that do NOT originate from the
                 IP address 192.0.2.44.

                 Negated -> (boolean)
                     Set Negated to False if you want AWS WAF to allow, block,
                     or  count requests based on the settings in the specified
                     ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet  ,   SqlInjectionMatchSet  ,   Xss-
                     MatchSet  ,   RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet , or  SizeCon-
                     straintSet . For example, if an IPSet includes the IP ad-
                     dress  192.0.2.44  , AWS WAF will allow or block requests
                     based on that IP address.

                     Set Negated to True if you want AWS WAF to allow or block
                     a  request  based  on the negation of the settings in the
                     ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet  ,   SqlInjectionMatchSet  ,   Xss-
                     MatchSet  ,   RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet , or  SizeCon-
                     straintSet . For example, if an IPSet includes the IP ad-
                     dress  192.0.2.44  ,  AWS WAF will allow, block, or count
                     requests based on all IP addresses except  192.0.2.44 .

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of predicate in a Rule , such  as  ByteMatch  or
                     IPSet .

                 DataId -> (string)
                     A  unique  identifier for a predicate in a Rule , such as
                     ByteMatchSetId or IPSetId . The ID  is  returned  by  the
                     corresponding Create or List command.

          RateKey -> (string)
              The  field that AWS WAF uses to determine if requests are likely
              arriving from single source and thus subject to rate monitoring.
              The  only  valid value for RateKey is IP . IP indicates that re-
              quests arriving from the same IP  address  are  subject  to  the
              RateLimit that is specified in the RateBasedRule .

          RateLimit -> (long)
              The maximum number of requests, which have an identical value in
              the field specified by the RateKey , allowed  in  a  five-minute
              period.  If the number of requests exceeds the RateLimit and the
              other predicates specified in the rule are  also  met,  AWS  WAF
              triggers the action that is specified for this rule.
