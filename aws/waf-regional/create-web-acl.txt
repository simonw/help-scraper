NAME
       create-web-acl -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Creates a WebACL , which contains the Rules that  identify  the  Cloud-
       Front  web  requests  that  you want to allow, block, or count. AWS WAF
       evaluates Rules in order based on the value of Priority for each Rule .

       You also specify a default action, either ALLOW or BLOCK . If a web re-
       quest  doesn't match any of the Rules in a WebACL , AWS WAF responds to
       the request with the default action.

       To create and configure a WebACL , perform the following steps:

       o Create and update the ByteMatchSet objects and other predicates  that
         you  want  to  include  in Rules . For more information, see  Create-
         ByteMatchSet ,  UpdateByteMatchSet ,  CreateIPSet  ,   UpdateIPSet  ,
         CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet , and  UpdateSqlInjectionMatchSet .

       o Create  and update the Rules that you want to include in the WebACL .
         For more information, see  CreateRule and  UpdateRule .

       o Use  GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide  in  the
         ChangeToken parameter of a CreateWebACL request.

       o Submit a CreateWebACL request.

       o Use  GetChangeToken  to  get the change token that you provide in the
         ChangeToken parameter of an  UpdateWebACL request.

       o Submit an  UpdateWebACL request to specify the Rules that you want to
         include  in  the WebACL , to specify the default action, and to asso-
         ciate the WebACL with a CloudFront distribution.

       For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API, see the AWS  WAF
       Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A  friendly  name  or  description of the  WebACL . You can't change
          Name after you create the WebACL .

       --metric-name (string)
          A friendly name or description for the metrics for this WebACL  .The
          name  can contain only alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), with
          maximum length 128 and minimum length one. It can't  contain  white-
          space or metric names reserved for AWS WAF, including "All" and "De-
          fault_Action." You can't change MetricName after you create the  We-
          bACL .

       --default-action (structure)
          The  action  that  you  want  AWS WAF to take when a request doesn't
          match the criteria specified in any of the Rule objects that are as-
          sociated with the WebACL .

          Type -> (string)
              Specifies how you want AWS WAF to respond to requests that match
              the settings in a Rule . Valid settings include the following:

              o ALLOW : AWS WAF allows requests

              o BLOCK : AWS WAF blocks requests

              o COUNT : AWS WAF increments a  counter  of  the  requests  that
                match  all of the conditions in the rule. AWS WAF then contin-
                ues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in
                the  web  ACL.  You can't specify COUNT for the default action
                for a WebACL .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Type": "BLOCK"|"ALLOW"|"COUNT"
          }

       --change-token (string)
          The value returned by the most recent call to  GetChangeToken .

       --tags (list)
          (structure)

              NOTE:
                 This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide  .  With  the  latest
                     version,  AWS  WAF  has a single set of endpoints for re-
                     gional and global use.

              A tag associated with an AWS resource. Tags are key:value  pairs
              that  you  can  use to categorize and manage your resources, for
              purposes like billing. For example, you might set the tag key to
              "customer"  and  the  value  to the customer name or ID. You can
              specify one or more tags to add to each AWS resource, up  to  50
              tags for a resource.

              Tagging  is  only  available through the API, SDKs, and CLI. You
              can't manage or view tags through the AWS WAF  Classic  console.
              You  can  tag  the AWS resources that you manage through AWS WAF
              Classic: web ACLs, rule groups, and rules.

              Key -> (string)

              Value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       WebACL -> (structure)
          The  WebACL returned in the CreateWebACL response.

          WebACLId -> (string)
              A  unique  identifier for a WebACL . You use WebACLId to get in-
              formation about a WebACL (see  GetWebACL ), update a WebACL (see
              UpdateWebACL ), and delete a WebACL from AWS WAF (see  DeleteWe-
              bACL ).
                 WebACLId is returned by  CreateWebACL and by  ListWebACLs .

          Name -> (string)
              A friendly name or description of the WebACL . You can't  change
              the name of a WebACL after you create it.

          MetricName -> (string)
              A friendly name or description for the metrics for this WebACL .
              The name can contain only  alphanumeric  characters  (A-Z,  a-z,
              0-9),  with  maximum length 128 and minimum length one. It can't
              contain whitespace or metric names reserved for AWS WAF, includ-
              ing  "All" and "Default_Action." You can't change MetricName af-
              ter you create the WebACL .

          DefaultAction -> (structure)
              The action to perform if none of the Rules contained in the  We-
              bACL match. The action is specified by the  WafAction object.

              Type -> (string)
                 Specifies  how  you  want AWS WAF to respond to requests that
                 match the settings in a Rule .  Valid  settings  include  the
                 following:

                 o ALLOW : AWS WAF allows requests

                 o BLOCK : AWS WAF blocks requests

                 o COUNT  :  AWS WAF increments a counter of the requests that
                   match all of the conditions in the rule. AWS WAF then  con-
                   tinues  to  inspect  the web request based on the remaining
                   rules in the web ACL. You can't specify COUNT for  the  de-
                   fault action for a WebACL .

          Rules -> (list)
              An  array  that  contains the action for each Rule in a WebACL ,
              the priority of the Rule , and the ID of the Rule .

              (structure)

                 NOTE:
                     This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  informa-
                     tion, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                        For  the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2
                        API and see the AWS WAF Developer  Guide  .  With  the
                        latest  version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints
                        for regional and global use.

                 The ActivatedRule object in an  UpdateWebACL  request  speci-
                 fies  a  Rule that you want to insert or delete, the priority
                 of the Rule in the WebACL , and the action that you want  AWS
                 WAF  to  take  when  a  web request matches the Rule (ALLOW ,
                 BLOCK , or COUNT ).

                 To specify whether to insert or delete a Rule , use  the  Ac-
                 tion parameter in the  WebACLUpdate data type.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     Specifies  the  order  in which the Rules in a WebACL are
                     evaluated. Rules with a  lower  value  for  Priority  are
                     evaluated  before  Rules  with  a higher value. The value
                     must be a unique integer. If you add multiple Rules to  a
                     WebACL , the values don't need to be consecutive.

                 RuleId -> (string)
                     The RuleId for a Rule . You use RuleId to get more infor-
                     mation about a Rule (see  GetRule ), update a  Rule  (see
                     UpdateRule ), insert a Rule into a WebACL or delete a one
                     from a WebACL (see  UpdateWebACL ), or delete a Rule from
                     AWS WAF (see  DeleteRule ).
                        RuleId is returned by  CreateRule and by  ListRules .

                 Action -> (structure)
                     Specifies  the  action  that  CloudFront or AWS WAF takes
                     when a web request matches the conditions in the  Rule  .
                     Valid values for Action include the following:

                     o ALLOW : CloudFront responds with the requested object.

                     o BLOCK  :  CloudFront responds with an HTTP 403 (Forbid-
                       den) status code.

                     o COUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of  requests  that
                       match  the conditions in the rule and then continues to
                       inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in
                       the web ACL.
                        ActivatedRule|OverrideAction  applies only when updat-
                        ing or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this  case,
                        you  do  not  use ActivatedRule|Action . For all other
                        update requests, ActivatedRule|Action is used  instead
                        of ActivatedRule|OverrideAction .

                     Type -> (string)
                        Specifies  how you want AWS WAF to respond to requests
                        that match the settings in a Rule . Valid settings in-
                        clude the following:

                        o ALLOW : AWS WAF allows requests

                        o BLOCK : AWS WAF blocks requests

                        o COUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of the requests
                          that match all of the conditions in  the  rule.  AWS
                          WAF  then continues to inspect the web request based
                          on the remaining rules in the  web  ACL.  You  can't
                          specify COUNT for the default action for a WebACL .

                 OverrideAction -> (structure)
                     Use the OverrideAction to test your RuleGroup .

                     Any  rule in a RuleGroup can potentially block a request.
                     If you set the OverrideAction to  None  ,  the  RuleGroup
                     will  block a request if any individual rule in the Rule-
                     Group matches the request and is configured to block that
                     request.  However if you first want to test the RuleGroup
                     , set the OverrideAction to Count .  The  RuleGroup  will
                     then  override  any  block action specified by individual
                     rules contained within the  group.  Instead  of  blocking
                     matching  requests,  those  requests will be counted. You
                     can view a record of counted requests  using   GetSample-
                     dRequests .
                        ActivatedRule|OverrideAction  applies only when updat-
                        ing or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In  this  case
                        you  do  not  use ActivatedRule|Action . For all other
                        update requests, ActivatedRule|Action is used  instead
                        of ActivatedRule|OverrideAction .

                     Type -> (string)
                        COUNT overrides the action specified by the individual
                        rule within a RuleGroup . If set to NONE , the  rule's
                        action will take place.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The  rule  type,  either  REGULAR , as defined by  Rule ,
                     RATE_BASED , as defined by  RateBasedRule , or GROUP , as
                     defined  by  RuleGroup . The default is REGULAR. Although
                     this field is optional, be aware that if you try to add a
                     RATE_BASED  rule  to  a web ACL without setting the type,
                     the  UpdateWebACL request will fail because  the  request
                     tries  to add a REGULAR rule with the specified ID, which
                     does not exist.

                 ExcludedRules -> (list)
                     An array of rules to exclude from a rule group.  This  is
                     applicable  only when the ActivatedRule refers to a Rule-
                     Group .

                     Sometimes it is necessary  to  troubleshoot  rule  groups
                     that are blocking traffic unexpectedly (false positives).
                     One troubleshooting technique is to identify the specific
                     rule  within  the rule group that is blocking the legiti-
                     mate traffic and then disable (exclude)  that  particular
                     rule.  You  can  exclude  rules  from  both your own rule
                     groups and AWS Marketplace rule groups that have been as-
                     sociated with a web ACL.

                     Specifying ExcludedRules does not remove those rules from
                     the rule group. Rather, it changes  the  action  for  the
                     rules  to  COUNT  . Therefore, requests that match an Ex-
                     cludedRule are counted but  not  blocked.  The  RuleGroup
                     owner will receive COUNT metrics for each ExcludedRule .

                     If  you  want  to exclude rules from a rule group that is
                     already associated with a web ACL, perform the  following
                     steps:

                     o Use  the  AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of the rules
                       that you want to exclude. For  more  information  about
                       the logs, see Logging Web ACL Traffic Information .

                     o Submit an  UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:

                       o The first action deletes the existing rule group from
                         the web ACL. That is, in the   UpdateWebACL  request,
                         the  first  Updates:Action  should  be DELETE and Up-
                         dates:ActivatedRule:RuleId should be the  rule  group
                         that contains the rules that you want to exclude.

                       o The  second  action  inserts the same rule group back
                         in, but specifying the rules to exclude. That is, the
                         second  Updates:Action should be INSERT , Updates:Ac-
                         tivatedRule:RuleId should be the rule group that  you
                         just  removed,  and  ExcludedRules should contain the
                         rules that you want to exclude.

                        NOTE:
                            This is AWS WAF Classic  documentation.  For  more
                            information,  see AWS WAF Classic in the developer
                            guide.
                               For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS
                               WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide .
                               With the latest version, AWS WAF has  a  single
                               set of endpoints for regional and global use.

                        The  rule to exclude from a rule group. This is appli-
                        cable only when the ActivatedRule refers  to  a  Rule-
                        Group  . The rule must belong to the RuleGroup that is
                        specified by the ActivatedRule .

                        RuleId -> (string)
                            The unique identifier for the rule to exclude from
                            the rule group.

          WebACLArn -> (string)
              Tha Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the web ACL.

       ChangeToken -> (string)
          The  ChangeToken  that  you used to submit the CreateWebACL request.
          You can also use this value to query the status of the request.  For
          more information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .
