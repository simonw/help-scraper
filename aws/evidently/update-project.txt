SYNOPSIS
            update-project
          [--description <value>]
          --project <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          An optional description of the project.

       --project (string)
          The name or ARN of the project to update.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              cloudWatchLogs -> (structure)
                 If the project stores evaluation events in  CloudWatch  Logs,

                 bucket -> (string)
                     The name of the bucket in which Evidently stores  evalua-
                     tion events.

              The number of experiments currently in  the  project.  This  in-
              cludes  all  experiments that have been created and not deleted,
              whether they are ongoing or not.
