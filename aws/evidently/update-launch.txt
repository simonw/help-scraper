       --randomization-salt (string)
          When Evidently assigns a particular user session  to  a  launch,  it
          must  use  a  randomization ID to determine which variation the user
          session is served. This randomization ID is a combination of the en-
          tity ID and randomizationSalt . If you omit randomizationSalt , Evi-
          dently uses the launch name as the randomizationSalt .

       --scheduled-splits-config (structure)
          An array of structures that define the traffic  allocation  percent-
          ages among the feature variations during each step of the launch.

          steps -> (list)
              An  array  of structures that define the traffic allocation per-
              centages among the feature variations during each  step  of  the
              launch. This also defines the start time of each step.

              (structure)
                 This  structure  defines  the  traffic allocation percentages
                 among the feature variations during one step of a launch, and
                 the start time of that step.

                 groupWeights -> (map)
                     The  traffic  allocation  percentages  among  the feature
                     variations during one step of a launch. This is a set  of
                     key-value pairs. The keys are variation names. The values
                     represent the percentage of traffic to allocate  to  that
                     variation during this step.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (long)

                 startTime -> (timestamp)
                     The date and time that this step of the launch starts.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          steps=[{groupWeights={KeyName1=long,KeyName2=long},startTime=timestamp},{groupWeights={KeyName1=long,KeyName2=long},startTime=timestamp}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "steps": [
              {
                "groupWeights": {"string": long
                  ...},
                "startTime": timestamp
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
