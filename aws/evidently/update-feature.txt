OPTIONS
       --add-or-update-variations (list)
          To update variation configurations for  this  feature,  or  add  new
          ones,  specify this structure. In this array, include any variations
          that you want to add or update. If the array  includes  a  variation
          name  that already exists for this feature, it is updated. If it in-
          cludes a new variation name, it is added as a new variation.

          (structure)
              This structure contains the name  and  variation  value  of  one
              variation of a feature.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the variation.

              value -> (structure)
                 The value assigned to this variation.

                 boolValue -> (boolean)
                     If  this  feature  uses  the Boolean variation type, this
                     field contains the Boolean value of this variation.

                 doubleValue -> (double)
                     If this feature uses the double integer  variation  type,
                     this  field  contains  the  double  integer value of this
                     variation.

                 longValue -> (long)
                     If this feature uses the long variation type, this  field
                     contains the long value of this variation.

                 stringValue -> (string)
                     If  this  feature  uses  the  string variation type, this
                     field contains the string value of this variation.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,value={boolValue=boolean,doubleValue=double,longValue=long,stringValue=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "value": {
                "boolValue": true|false,
                "doubleValue": double,
                "longValue": long,
                "stringValue": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --default-variation (string)
          The name of the variation to use as the default variation.  The  de-
          fault  variation is served to users who are not allocated to any on-
          going launches or experiments of this feature.

       --description (string)
          An optional description of the feature.

       --entity-overrides (map)
          Specified users that should always be served a specific variation of
          a  feature.  Each  user  is specified by a key-value pair . For each
          key, specify a user by entering their user ID, account ID,  or  some
          other  identifier.  For the value, specify the name of the variation
          that they are to be served.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --evaluation-strategy (string)
          Specify ALL_RULES to activate the traffic  allocation  specified  by
          any  ongoing  launches  or experiments. Specify DEFAULT_VARIATION to
          serve the default variation to all users instead.

          Possible values:

          o ALL_RULES

          o DEFAULT_VARIATION

       --feature (string)
          The name of the feature to be updated.

       --project (string)
          The name or ARN of the project that contains the feature to  be  up-
          dated.

       --remove-variations (list)
          Removes  a  variation from the feature. If the variation you specify
          doesn't exist, then this makes no change and does not report an  er-
          ror.

          This  operation  fails if you try to remove a variation that is part
          of an ongoing launch or experiment.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       feature -> (structure)
          A structure that contains information about the updated feature.

          arn -> (string)
              The ARN of the feature.

          createdTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the feature is created.

          defaultVariation -> (string)
              The name of the variation that is used as the default variation.
              The  default  variation is served to users who are not allocated
              to any ongoing launches or experiments of this feature.

              This variation must also be listed in the variations structure.

              If you omit defaultVariation , the first variation listed in the
              variations structure is used as the default variation.

          description -> (string)
              The description of the feature.

          entityOverrides -> (map)
              A set of key-value pairs that specify users who should always be
              served a specific variation of a feature. Each key  specifies  a
              user  using their user ID, account ID, or some other identifier.
              The value specifies the name of the variation that the  user  is
              to be served.

              For  the  override  to  be successful, the value of the key must
              match the entityId used in the EvaluateFeature operation.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          evaluationRules -> (list)

              feature.

              (structure)
                 A structure that contains the information about an evaluation
                 rule for this feature, if it is used in a launch  or  experi-
                 ment.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the experiment or launch.

                     tion rule for a launch, and it is  aws.evidently.onlineab
                     if this is an evaluation rule for an experiment.

          evaluationStrategy -> (string)
              If this value is ALL_RULES , the traffic allocation specified by
              any ongoing launches or experiments is being used.  If  this  is
              DEFAULT_VARIATION , the default variation is being served to all
              users.

                        If  this feature uses the Boolean variation type, this
                        field contains the Boolean value of this variation.

                     doubleValue -> (double)
                        If this feature  uses  the  double  integer  variation
                        type,  this field contains the double integer value of
