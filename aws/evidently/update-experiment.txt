       --metric-goals (list)
          An array of structures that defines the metrics used for the experi-
          ment,  and  whether  a  higher or lower value for each metric is the

       Shorthand Syntax:

          desiredChange=string,metricDefinition={entityIdKey=string,eventPattern=string,name=string,unitLabel=string,valueKey=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "desiredChange": "INCREASE"|"DECREASE",
              "metricDefinition": {
                "entityIdKey": "string",
                "eventPattern": "string",
                "name": "string",
                "unitLabel": "string",
                "valueKey": "string"
              }

            ...
          ]

       --online-ab-config (structure)
          A structure that contains the configuration of which variation o use
          as the "control" version. The "control" version is used for compari-
          son  with  other  variations. This structure also specifies how much
          experiment traffic is allocated to each variation.

          controlTreatmentName -> (string)
              The name of the variation that is to be  the  default  variation
              that the other variations are compared to.

          treatmentWeights -> (map)
              A  set of key-value pairs. The keys are variation names, and the
              values are the portion of experiment traffic to be  assigned  to
              that  variation. Specify the traffic portion in thousandths of a
              percent, so 20,000 for a variation would allocate 20% of the ex-
              periment traffic to that variation.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (long)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          controlTreatmentName=string,treatmentWeights={KeyName1=long,KeyName2=long}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "controlTreatmentName": "string",

              ...}
          }

       --project (string)
          The name or ARN of the project that contains the experiment that you
          want to update.

       --randomization-salt (string)
          When Evidently assigns a particular user session to  an  experiment,
          it must use a randomization ID to determine which variation the user
          session is served. This randomization ID is a combination of the en-
          tity ID and randomizationSalt . If you omit randomizationSalt , Evi-
          dently uses the experiment name as the randomizationSalt .

       --sampling-rate (long)
          The portion of the available audience that you want to  allocate  to
          this experiment, in thousandths of a percent. The available audience
          is the total audience minus the audience that you have allocated  to
          overrides or current launches of this feature.

          This  is represented in thousandths of a percent. For example, spec-
          ify 20,000 to allocate 20% of the available audience.

       --treatments (list)
          An array of structures that define the variations  being  tested  in
          the experiment.

          (structure)
              A  structure  that  defines  one  treatment  in an experiment. A
              treatment is a variation of the feature that you  are  including
              in the experiment.

              description -> (string)
                 A description for this treatment.

              feature -> (string)
                 The feature that this experiment is testing.

              name -> (string)
                 A name for this treatment.

              variation -> (string)
                 The name of the variation to use as this treatment in the ex-
                 periment.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          description=string,feature=string,name=string,variation=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "description": "string",
              "feature": "string",
              "name": "string",
              "variation": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          onlineAbDefinition -> (structure)
              A  structure  that contains the configuration of which variation
              to use as the "control" version. The "control" version  is  used
              for comparison with other variations. This structure also speci-
              fies how much experiment traffic is allocated to each variation.

              controlTreatmentName -> (string)
                 The name of the variation that is the default variation  that
                 the other variations are compared to.

              treatmentWeights -> (map)
                 A  set  of key-value pairs. The keys are variation names, and
                 the values are the portion of experiment traffic  to  be  as-
                 signed to that variation. The traffic portion is specified in
                 thousandths of a percent, so 20,000 for a variation would al-

          randomizationSalt -> (string)
              This value is used when Evidently assigns a particular user ses-
              sion to the experiment. It helps create a  randomization  ID  to
              determine  which variation the user session is served. This ran-
              domization ID is a combination of the entity ID  and  randomiza-
              tionSalt .

          samplingRate -> (long)
              In  thousandths  of a percent, the amount of the available audi-
              ence that is allocated to this experiment. The  available  audi-
              ence  is the total audience minus the audience that you have al-
              located to overrides or current launches of this feature.

              This is represented in thousandths of a percent, so a  value  of
              10,000 is 10% of the available audience.

          schedule -> (structure)
              A  structure that contains the time and date that Evidently com-
              pleted the analysis of the experiment.
