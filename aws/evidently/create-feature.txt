CREATE-FEATURE()                                              CREATE-FEATURE()



NAME
       create-feature -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  Evidently feature that you want to launch or test. You can
       define up to five variations of a feature, and use these variations  in
       your  launches and experiments. A feature must be created in a project.
       For information about creating a project, see CreateProject .

       Don't use this operation to update an existing  feature.  Instead,  use
       UpdateFeature .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --default-variation (string)
          The  name  of the variation to use as the default variation. The de-
          fault variation is served to users who are not allocated to any  on-
          going launches or experiments of this feature.

          This variation must also be listed in the variations structure.

          If  you  omit  defaultVariation  , the first variation listed in the
          variations structure is used as the default variation.

       --description (string)
          An optional description of the feature.

       --entity-overrides (map)
          Specify users that should always be served a specific variation of a
          feature.  Each user is specified by a key-value pair . For each key,
          specify a user by entering their user ID, account ID, or some  other
          identifier.  For  the  value, specify the name of the variation that
          they are to be served.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --evaluation-strategy (string)
          Specify ALL_RULES to activate the traffic  allocation  specified  by
          any  ongoing  launches  or experiments. Specify DEFAULT_VARIATION to
          serve the default variation to all users instead.

          Possible values:

          o ALL_RULES

          o DEFAULT_VARIATION

       --name (string)
          The name for the new feature.

       --project (string)
          The name or ARN of the project that is to contain the new feature.

       --tags (map)
          Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the feature.

          Tags can help you organize and categorize your  resources.  You  can
          also  use  them to scope user permissions by granting a user permis-
          sion to access or change only resources with certain tag values.

          Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and  are
          interpreted strictly as strings of characters.
              <p>You  can  associate  as  many  as 50 tags with a feature.</p>

       --variations (list)
          An array of structures that contain the configuration  of  the  fea-
          ture's different variations.

          (structure)
              This  structure  contains  the  name  and variation value of one
              variation of a feature.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the variation.

              value -> (structure)
                 The value assigned to this variation.

                 boolValue -> (boolean)
                     If this feature uses the  Boolean  variation  type,  this
                     field contains the Boolean value of this variation.

                 doubleValue -> (double)
                     If  this  feature uses the double integer variation type,
                     this field contains the  double  integer  value  of  this
                     variation.

                 longValue -> (long)
                     If  this feature uses the long variation type, this field
                     contains the long value of this variation.

                 stringValue -> (string)
                     If this feature uses  the  string  variation  type,  this
                     field contains the string value of this variation.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,value={boolValue=boolean,doubleValue=double,longValue=long,stringValue=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "value": {
                "boolValue": true|false,
                "doubleValue": double,
                "longValue": long,
                "stringValue": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       feature -> (structure)
          A structure that contains information about the new feature.

          arn -> (string)

          defaultVariation -> (string)
              The name of the variation that is used as the default variation.
              The  default  variation is served to users who are not allocated
              to any ongoing launches or experiments of this feature.

              This variation must also be listed in the variations structure.

              If you omit defaultVariation , the first variation listed in the
              variations structure is used as the default variation.

          description -> (string)
              The description of the feature.

          entityOverrides -> (map)
              A set of key-value pairs that specify users who should always be
              served a specific variation of a feature. Each key  specifies  a
              user  using their user ID, account ID, or some other identifier.
              The value specifies the name of the variation that the  user  is
              to be served.

              For  the  override  to  be successful, the value of the key must
