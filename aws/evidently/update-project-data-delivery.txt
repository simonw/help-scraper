UPDATE-PROJECT-DATA-DELIVERY()                  UPDATE-PROJECT-DATA-DELIVERY()



NAME
       update-project-data-delivery -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the data storage options for this project. If you store evalua-
       tion events, you an keep them and analyze them  on  your  own.  If  you
       choose not to store evaluation events, Evidently deletes them after us-
       ing them to produce metrics and other experiment results that  you  can
       view.

       You can't specify both cloudWatchLogs and s3Destination in the same op-
       eration.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-project-data-delivery
          [--cloud-watch-logs <value>]
          --project <value>
          [--s3-destination <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cloud-watch-logs (structure)
          A structure containing the CloudWatch Logs log group where you  want
          to store evaluation events.

          logGroup -> (string)
              The  name  of  the log group where the project stores evaluation
              events.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          logGroup=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "logGroup": "string"
          }

       --project (string)
          The name or ARN of the project that you  want  to  modify  the  data
          storage options for.

       --s3-destination (structure)
          A  structure  containing  the S3 bucket name and bucket prefix where
          you want to store evaluation events.

          bucket -> (string)
              The name of the bucket  in  which  Evidently  stores  evaluation
              events.

          prefix -> (string)
              The bucket prefix in which Evidently stores evaluation events.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          bucket=string,prefix=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "bucket": "string",
            "prefix": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              A  structure  that contains information about where Evidently is
              to store evaluation events for longer term storage.

              cloudWatchLogs -> (structure)
                 If the project stores evaluation events in  CloudWatch  Logs,
                 this structure stores the log group name.

                 logGroup -> (string)
                     The name of the log group where the project stores evalu-
                     ation events.

              s3Destination -> (structure)
                 If the project stores  evaluation  events  in  an  Amazon  S3
                 bucket, this structure stores the bucket name and bucket pre-
                 fix.

                 bucket -> (string)
