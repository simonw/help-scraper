GET-EXPERIMENT-RESULTS()                              GET-EXPERIMENT-RESULTS()



NAME
       get-experiment-results -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the results of a running or completed experiment. No results
       are available until there have been 100 events for each  variation  and
       at least 10 minutes have passed since the start of the experiment.

       Experiment  results  are available up to 63 days after the start of the
       experiment. They are not available after  that  because  of  CloudWatch
       data retention policies.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --base-stat (string)
          The  statistic  used  to calculate experiment results. Currently the
          only valid value is mean , which uses the mean of the collected val-
          ues as the statistic.

          Possible values:

          o Mean

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The  date  and  time  that the experiment ended, if it is completed.
          This must be no longer than 30 days after the experiment start time.

       --experiment (string)
          The name of the experiment to retrieve the results of.

       --metric-names (list)
          The names of the experiment metrics that you want to see the results
          of.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --period (long)
          In seconds, the amount of time to aggregate results together.

       --project (string)
          The name or ARN of the project that contains the experiment that you
          want to see the results of.

       --report-names (list)
          The names of the report types  that  you  want  to  see.  Currently,
          BayesianInference is the only valid value.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            BayesianInference

       --result-stats (list)
          The statistics that you want to see in the returned results.

          o PValue  specifies  to  use  p-values for the results. A p-value is
            used in hypothesis testing to measure how often you are willing to
            make  a  mistake in rejecting the null hypothesis. A general prac-
            tice is to reject the null hypothesis and declare that the results
            are statistically significant when the p-value is less than 0.05.

          o ConfidenceInterval  specifies  a  confidence  interval for the re-
            sults. The confidence interval represents the range of values  for
            the  chosen  metric  that is likely to contain the true difference
            between the baseStat of a variation and  the  baseline.  Evidently
            returns the 95% confidence interval.

          o TreatmentEffect  is  the  difference in the statistic specified by
            the baseStat parameter between  each  variation  and  the  default
            variation.

          o BaseStat  returns  the statistical values collected for the metric
            for each variation. The statistic uses the same  statistic  speci-
            fied  in  the baseStat parameter. Therefore, if baseStat is mean ,
            this returns the mean of the values collected for each variation.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            BaseStat
            TreatmentEffect
            ConfidenceInterval
            PValue

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The date and time that the experiment started.

       --treatment-names (list)
          The names of the experiment treatments that you want to see the  re-
          sults for.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
