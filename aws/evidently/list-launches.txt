LIST-LAUNCHES()                                                LIST-LAUNCHES()



NAME
       list-launches -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  configuration  details about all the launches in the specified
       project.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-launches is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: launches

SYNOPSIS
            list-launches
          --project <value>
          [--status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project (string)
          The name or ARN of the project to return the launch list from.

       --status (string)
          Use  this  optional  parameter to limit the returned results to only
          the launches with the status that you specify here.

          Possible values:

          o CREATED

          o UPDATING

          o RUNNING

          o COMPLETED

          o CANCELLED

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                            The EventBridge event pattern that defines how the
                            metric is recorded.

                            For more information about EventBridge event  pat-
                            terns, see Amazon EventBridge event patterns .

                 This value is used when Evidently assigns a  particular  user
                 session  to  the launch, to help create a randomization ID to
                 determine which variation the user session  is  served.  This
                 randomization  ID  is a combination of the entity ID and ran-
                 domizationSalt .

              scheduledSplitsDefinition -> (structure)
                 An array of structures that  define  the  traffic  allocation

                     percentages among the feature variations during each step
                     of the launch. This also defines the start time  of  each
                     step.

                        This structure defines the traffic allocation percent-
                        ages among the feature variations during one step of a
                        launch, and the start time of that step.

                            The  traffic allocation percentages among the fea-
                            ture variations during one step of a launch.  This
                            is  a  set of key-value pairs. The keys are varia-
                            tion names. The values represent the percentage of
                            traffic  to allocate to that variation during this
                            step.

                 If  the  launch  was stopped, this is the string that was en-
                 tered by the person who stopped the launch, to explain why it
                 was stopped.

              tags -> (map)
                 The list of tag keys and values associated with this launch.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              type -> (string)
                 The type of launch.
