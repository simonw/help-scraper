CREATE-EXPERIMENT()                                        CREATE-EXPERIMENT()



NAME
       create-experiment -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an Evidently experiment . Before you create an experiment, you
       must create the feature to use for the experiment.

       An experiment helps you make feature design decisions based on evidence
       and  data.  An  experiment can test as many as five variations at once.
       Evidently collects experiment data and analyzes it by statistical meth-
       ods,  and provides clear recommendations about which variations perform
       better.

       Don't use this operation to update an existing experiment. Instead, use
       UpdateExperiment .

OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          An optional description of the experiment.

       --metric-goals (list)
          An array of structures that defines the metrics used for the experi-
          ment, and whether a higher or lower value for  each  metric  is  the
          goal.

          (structure)
              Use  this  structure  to  tell Evidently whether higher or lower
              values are desired for a metric that is used in an experiment.

              desiredChange -> (string)
                 INCREASE means that a variation with a higher number for this
                 metric is performing better.

                 DECREASE  means that a variation with a lower number for this
                 metric is performing better.

                     tion  that causes a metric value to be recorded. An exam-
                     ple is userDetails.userID .

                 eventPattern -> (string)
                     The EventBridge event pattern that defines how the metric
                     is recorded.

                     For  more  information  about EventBridge event patterns,
                     see Amazon EventBridge event patterns .

                 name -> (string)

                     The value that is tracked to produce the metric.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          desiredChange=string,metricDefinition={entityIdKey=string,eventPattern=string,name=string,unitLabel=string,valueKey=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "desiredChange": "INCREASE"|"DECREASE",
              "metricDefinition": {
                "entityIdKey": "string",
                "eventPattern": "string",
                "name": "string",
                "unitLabel": "string",
                "valueKey": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --name (string)
          A name for the new experiment.

       --online-ab-config (structure)
          A structure that contains the configuration of  which  variation  to
          use  as  the  "control"  version. tThe "control" version is used for
          comparison with other variations. This structure also specifies  how
          much experiment traffic is allocated to each variation.

          controlTreatmentName -> (string)
              The  name  of  the variation that is to be the default variation
              that the other variations are compared to.

          treatmentWeights -> (map)
              A set of key-value pairs. The keys are variation names, and  the
              values  are  the portion of experiment traffic to be assigned to
              that variation. Specify the traffic portion in thousandths of  a
              percent, so 20,000 for a variation would allocate 20% of the ex-
              periment traffic to that variation.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (long)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          controlTreatmentName=string,treatmentWeights={KeyName1=long,KeyName2=long}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "controlTreatmentName": "string",

       --project (string)
          The name or ARN of the project that you want to create the  new  ex-
          periment in.

       --randomization-salt (string)
          When  Evidently  assigns a particular user session to an experiment,
          it must use a randomization ID to determine which variation the user
          session is served. This randomization ID is a combination of the en-
          tity ID and randomizationSalt . If you omit randomizationSalt , Evi-
          dently uses the experiment name as the randomizationSalt .

       --sampling-rate (long)
          The  portion  of the available audience that you want to allocate to
          this experiment, in thousandths of a percent. The available audience
          is  the total audience minus the audience that you have allocated to
          overrides or current launches of this feature.

          This is represented in thousandths of a percent. For example,  spec-
          ify 10,000 to allocate 10% of the available audience.

       --tags (map)
          Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the experiment.

          Tags  can  help  you organize and categorize your resources. You can
          also use them to scope user permissions by granting a  user  permis-
          sion to access or change only resources with certain tag values.

          Tags  don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are
          interpreted strictly as strings of characters.
              <p>You can associate as many as 50 tags with an  experiment.</p>

          ture variation used in the experiment.

          (structure)
              A structure that defines  one  treatment  in  an  experiment.  A

                 A name for this treatment.

              variation -> (string)
                 The name of the variation to use as this treatment in the ex-
                 periment.

          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

              A  structure  that contains the configuration of which variation
              to use as the "control" version. The "control" version  is  used
              for comparison with other variations. This structure also speci-
              fies how much experiment traffic is allocated to each variation.

                 The name of the variation that is the default variation  that
                 the other variations are compared to.

              treatmentWeights -> (map)
                 A  set  of key-value pairs. The keys are variation names, and
                 the values are the portion of experiment traffic  to  be  as-
                 signed to that variation. The traffic portion is specified in
                 thousandths of a percent, so 20,000 for a variation would al-

          randomizationSalt -> (string)
              This value is used when Evidently assigns a particular user ses-
              sion to the experiment. It helps create a  randomization  ID  to
              determine  which variation the user session is served. This ran-
              domization ID is a combination of the entity ID  and  randomiza-
              tionSalt .

          samplingRate -> (long)
              In  thousandths  of a percent, the amount of the available audi-
              ence that is allocated to this experiment. The  available  audi-
              ence  is the total audience minus the audience that you have al-
              located to overrides or current launches of this feature.

              This is represented in thousandths of a percent, so a  value  of
              10,000 is 10% of the available audience.

              If  the  experiment was stopped, this is the string that was en-
              tered by the person who stopped the experiment, to  explain  why
              it was stopped.

          tags -> (map)
              The list of tag keys and values associated with this experiment.

              key -> (string)

              feature variation used in the experiment.

              (structure)
                 A structure that defines one treatment in  an  experiment.  A
                 treatment  is a variation of the feature that you are includ-
                 ing in the experiment.

                 description -> (string)

                 featureVariations -> (map)
                     The feature variation used for this treatment. This is  a
                     key-value  pair.  The  key  is  the feature name, and the
                     value is the variation name.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of this treatment.
