GET-LAUNCH()                                                      GET-LAUNCH()



NAME
       get-launch -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the details about one launch. You must already know the launch
       name. To retrieve a list of launches in your account, use  ListLaunches
       .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-launch
          --launch <value>
          --project <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --launch (string)
          The name of the launch that you want to see the details of.

       --project (string)
          The name or ARN of the project that contains the launch.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     A structure that defines the metric.

                        The  entity,  such  as a user or session, that does an
                        action that causes a metric value to be recorded.

                     eventPattern -> (string)
                        The EventBridge event pattern  that  defines  how  the

              mine which variation the user session is served. This randomiza-
              tion  ID is a combination of the entity ID and randomizationSalt
              .

              launch.

              steps -> (list)
                 An array of structures that  define  the  traffic  allocation
                 percentages  among the feature variations during each step of

                 (structure)
                     This structure defines the traffic allocation percentages
                     among the feature variations during one step of a launch,

                        of key-value pairs. The keys are variation names.  The
                        values represent the percentage of traffic to allocate
                        to that variation during this step.
