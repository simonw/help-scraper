GET-DEPLOYMENTS()                                            GET-DEPLOYMENTS()



NAME
       get-deployments -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the Deployments for an API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-deployments is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Items

SYNOPSIS
            get-deployments
          --api-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --api-id (string)
          The API identifier.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (string)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve a list of deployments

       The  following  get-deployments  example  displays  a list of all of an
       API's deployments.

          aws apigatewayv2 get-deployments \
              --api-id a1b2c3d4

       Output:

          {
              "Items": [
                  {
                      "AutoDeployed": true,
                      "CreatedDate": "2020-04-07T23:58:40Z",
                      "DeploymentId": "abcdef",
                      "DeploymentStatus": "DEPLOYED",
                      "Description": "Automatic deployment triggered by changes to the Api configuration"
                  },
                  {
                      "AutoDeployed": true,
                      "CreatedDate": "2020-04-06T00:33:00Z",
                      "DeploymentId": "bcdefg",
                      "DeploymentStatus": "DEPLOYED",
                      "Description": "Automatic deployment triggered by changes to the Api configuration"
                  }
              ]
          }

              An  immutable  representation  of  an  API that can be called by
              users. A Deployment must be associated with a Stage for it to be
              callable over the internet.

              AutoDeployed -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether a deployment was automatically released.

              CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the Deployment resource was created.

              DeploymentId -> (string)
                 The identifier for the deployment.

              DeploymentStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the deployment: PENDING, FAILED, or SUCCEEDED.

              DeploymentStatusMessage -> (string)
                 May  contain  additional feedback on the status of an API de-
                 ployment.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description for the deployment.

       NextToken -> (string)
