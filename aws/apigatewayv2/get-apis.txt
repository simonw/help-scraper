GET-APIS()                                                          GET-APIS()



NAME
       get-apis -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a collection of Api resources.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-apis  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation  by  providing  the --no-paginate argument.  When using --output
       text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query  ar-
       gument  must  extract  data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Items

SYNOPSIS
            get-apis
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (string)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Items -> (list)
          The elements from this collection.

          (structure)
              Represents an API.

              ApiEndpoint -> (string)
                 The  URI  of  the  API, of the form {api-id}.execute-api.{re-
                 gion}.amazonaws.com. The stage name is typically appended  to

              ApiGatewayManaged -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether an API is managed by API Gateway. You can't
                 update or delete a managed API by using API Gateway.  A  man-
                 aged  API  can be deleted only through the tooling or service
                 that created it.

              ApiId -> (string)
                 The API ID.

              ApiKeySelectionExpression -> (string)
                 An API key selection expression. Supported only for WebSocket
                 APIs. See API Key Selection Expressions .

              CorsConfiguration -> (structure)
                 A CORS configuration. Supported only for HTTP APIs.

                 AllowCredentials -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  credentials  are included in the CORS
                     request. Supported only for HTTP APIs.

                 AllowHeaders -> (list)
                     Represents a collection  of  allowed  headers.  Supported
                     only for HTTP APIs.

                     (string)

                 AllowMethods -> (list)
                     Represents  a  collection  of  allowed HTTP methods. Sup-
                     ported only for HTTP APIs.

                     (string)
                        A string with a length between [1-64].

                 AllowOrigins -> (list)
                     Represents a collection  of  allowed  origins.  Supported
                     only for HTTP APIs.

                     (string)

                 ExposeHeaders -> (list)
                     Represents  a  collection  of  exposed headers. Supported
                     only for HTTP APIs.

                     (string)

                 MaxAge -> (integer)
                     The number of seconds that the browser should cache  pre-
                     flight request results. Supported only for HTTP APIs.

              CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp when the API was created.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the API.

              DisableSchemaValidation -> (boolean)
                 Avoid validating models when creating a deployment. Supported
                 only for WebSocket APIs.

              DisableExecuteApiEndpoint -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether clients can invoke your API  by  using  the
                 default  execute-api endpoint. By default, clients can invoke
                 your          API          with          the          default
                 https://{api_id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com endpoint.
                 To require that clients use a custom domain  name  to  invoke
                 your API, disable the default endpoint.

              ImportInfo -> (list)
                 The  validation  information  during API import. This may in-
                 clude particular properties of your OpenAPI definition  which
                 are ignored during import. Supported only for HTTP APIs.

                 (string)

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the API.

              ProtocolType -> (string)

              RouteSelectionExpression -> (string)
                 The  route  selection  expression for the API. For HTTP APIs,
                 the routeSelectionExpression must be ${request.method}  ${re-
                 quest.path}.  If  not  provided, this will be the default for
                 HTTP APIs. This property is required for WebSocket APIs.

              Tags -> (map)
                 A collection of tags associated with the API.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)
                     A string with a length between [0-1600].

              Version -> (string)
                 A version identifier for the API.

              Warnings -> (list)
                 The warning messages reported when failonwarnings  is  turned
                 on during API import.

                 (string)
