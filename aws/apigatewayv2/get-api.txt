GET-API()                                                            GET-API()



NAME
       get-api -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets an Api resource.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-api
          --api-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --api-id (string)
          The API identifier.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve information about an API

       The following get-api example displays information about an API.

          aws apigatewayv2 get-api \
              --api-id a1b2c3d4

       Output:

          {
              "ApiEndpoint": "https://a1b2c3d4.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com",
              "ApiId": "a1b2c3d4",
              "ApiKeySelectionExpression": "$request.header.x-api-key",
              "CreatedDate": "2020-03-28T00:32:37Z",
              "Name": "my-api",
              "ProtocolType": "HTTP",
              "RouteSelectionExpression": "$request.method $request.path",
              "Tags": {
                  "department": "finance"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       ApiEndpoint -> (string)
          The  URI  of the API, of the form {api-id}.execute-api.{region}.ama-
          zonaws.com. The stage name is typically appended to this URI to form
          a complete path to a deployed API stage.

       ApiGatewayManaged -> (boolean)
          Specifies whether an API is managed by API Gateway. You can't update
          or delete a managed API by using API Gateway. A managed API  can  be
          deleted only through the tooling or service that created it.

       ApiId -> (string)
          The API ID.

       ApiKeySelectionExpression -> (string)
          An  API key selection expression. Supported only for WebSocket APIs.
          See API Key Selection Expressions .

       CorsConfiguration -> (structure)
          A CORS configuration. Supported only for HTTP APIs.

          AllowCredentials -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether credentials are included in the CORS  request.
              Supported only for HTTP APIs.

          AllowHeaders -> (list)
              Represents  a  collection of allowed headers. Supported only for
              HTTP APIs.

              (string)

          AllowMethods -> (list)
              Represents a collection of allowed HTTP methods. Supported  only
              for HTTP APIs.

              (string)
                 A string with a length between [1-64].

          AllowOrigins -> (list)
              Represents  a  collection of allowed origins. Supported only for
              HTTP APIs.

              (string)

          ExposeHeaders -> (list)
              Represents a collection of exposed headers. Supported  only  for
              HTTP APIs.

              (string)

          MaxAge -> (integer)
              The  number  of  seconds that the browser should cache preflight
              request results. Supported only for HTTP APIs.

       CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp when the API was created.

       Description -> (string)
          The description of the API.

       DisableSchemaValidation -> (boolean)
          Avoid validating models when creating a deployment.  Supported  only
          for WebSocket APIs.

       DisableExecuteApiEndpoint -> (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  clients can invoke your API by using the default
          execute-api endpoint. By default, clients can invoke your  API  with
          the default https://{api_id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com end-
          point. To require that clients use a custom domain  name  to  invoke
          your API, disable the default endpoint.

       ImportInfo -> (list)
          The  validation information during API import. This may include par-
          ticular properties of your OpenAPI definition which are ignored dur-
          ing import. Supported only for HTTP APIs.

          The  route  selection  expression  for  the  API. For HTTP APIs, the
          routeSelectionExpression must be ${request.method}  ${request.path}.
          If  not provided, this will be the default for HTTP APIs. This prop-
          erty is required for WebSocket APIs.

       Tags -> (map)
          A collection of tags associated with the API.

          key -> (string)
