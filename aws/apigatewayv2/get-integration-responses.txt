NAME
       get-integration-responses -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the IntegrationResponses for an Integration.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-integration-responses  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: Items

SYNOPSIS
            get-integration-responses
          --api-id <value>
          --integration-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --api-id (string)
          The API identifier.

       --integration-id (string)
          The integration ID.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (string)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Items -> (list)
          The elements from this collection.

          (structure)
              Represents an integration response.

              ContentHandlingStrategy -> (string)
                 Supported  only  for  WebSocket APIs. Specifies how to handle
                 response payload content type conversions.  Supported  values
                 are CONVERT_TO_BINARY and CONVERT_TO_TEXT, with the following
                 behaviors:

                 CONVERT_TO_BINARY:  Converts  a  response  payload   from   a
                 Base64-encoded string to the corresponding binary blob.

                 CONVERT_TO_TEXT:  Converts  a  response payload from a binary
                 blob to a Base64-encoded string.

                 If this property is not defined, the response payload will be
                 passed through from the integration response to the route re-
                 sponse or method response without modification.

              IntegrationResponseId -> (string)
                 The integration response ID.

              IntegrationResponseKey -> (string)
                 The integration response key.

              ResponseParameters -> (map)
                 A key-value  map  specifying  response  parameters  that  are
                 passed  to the method response from the backend. The key is a
                 method response header parameter name and the mapped value is
                 an integration response header value, a static value enclosed
                 within a pair of single quotes, or a JSON expression from the
                 integration  response  body.  The  mapping key must match the
                 pattern of method.response.header.{name},  where  name  is  a
                 valid  and  unique  header  name. The mapped non-static value
                 must match the pattern of  integration.response.header.{name}
                 or integration.response.body.{JSON-expression}, where name is
                 a valid and unique response header name  and  JSON-expression
                 is a valid JSON expression without the $ prefix.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)
                     A string with a length between [1-512].

              ResponseTemplates -> (map)
                 The  collection of response templates for the integration re-
                 sponse as a string-to-string map of key-value pairs. Response
                 templates  are  represented  as  a key/value map, with a con-
                 tent-type as the key and a template as the value.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)
                     A string with a length between [0-32768].

              TemplateSelectionExpression -> (string)
                 The template selection expressions for  the  integration  re-
                 sponse.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  next  page  of elements from this collection. Not valid for the
          last element of the collection.
