GET-AUTHORIZERS()                                            GET-AUTHORIZERS()



NAME
       get-authorizers -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the Authorizers for an API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-authorizers is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Items

SYNOPSIS
            get-authorizers
          --api-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --api-id (string)
          The API identifier.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (string)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Items -> (list)
          The elements from this collection.

          (structure)
              Represents an authorizer.

              AuthorizerCredentialsArn -> (string)
                 Specifies the required credentials as an  IAM  role  for  API
                 Gateway  to invoke the authorizer. To specify an IAM role for
                 API Gateway to assume, use the role's  Amazon  Resource  Name
                 (ARN).  To use resource-based permissions on the Lambda func-
                 tion, don't specify this parameter. Supported  only  for  RE-
                 QUEST authorizers.

              AuthorizerId -> (string)
                 The authorizer identifier.

              AuthorizerPayloadFormatVersion -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  format  of  the  payload  sent to an HTTP API
                 Lambda authorizer. Required for HTTP API Lambda  authorizers.
                 Supported  values are 1.0 and 2.0. To learn more, see Working
                 with AWS Lambda authorizers for HTTP APIs .

              AuthorizerResultTtlInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The time to live (TTL) for cached authorizer results, in sec-
                 onds.  If  it equals 0, authorization caching is disabled. If
                 it is greater than  0,  API  Gateway  caches  authorizer  re-
                 sponses. The maximum value is 3600, or 1 hour. Supported only
                 for HTTP API Lambda authorizers.

              AuthorizerType -> (string)
                 The authorizer type. Specify REQUEST for  a  Lambda  function
                 using  incoming  request  parameters. Specify JWT to use JSON
                 Web Tokens (supported only for HTTP APIs).

              AuthorizerUri -> (string)
                 The authorizer's Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).  For  RE-
                 QUEST authorizers, this must be a well-formed Lambda function
                 URI,          for          example,          arn:aws:apigate-
                 way:us-west-2:lambda:path/2015-03-31/func-
                 tions/arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:{account_id}:func-
                 tion:{lambda_function_name}/invocations.  In general, the URI
                 has this form:  arn:aws:apigateway:{region}:lambda:path/{ser-
                 vice_api},  where  {region} is the same as the region hosting
                 the Lambda function, path indicates that the  remaining  sub-
                 string  in  the  URI should be treated as the path to the re-
                 source, including the initial /. For Lambda  functions,  this
                 is   usually   of   the   form   /2015-03-31/functions/[Func-
                 tionARN]/invocations. Supported only for REQUEST authorizers.

              EnableSimpleResponses -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether a Lambda authorizer returns a response in a
                 simple format. If enabled, the Lambda authorizer can return a
                 boolean value instead of an IAM policy.  Supported  only  for
                 HTTP  APIs. To learn more, see Working with AWS Lambda autho-
                 rizers for HTTP APIs

              IdentitySource -> (list)
                 The identity source for which authorization is requested.

                 For a REQUEST authorizer, this is optional. The  value  is  a
                 set  of  one or more mapping expressions of the specified re-
                 quest parameters. The identity source can be  headers,  query
                 string  parameters,  stage variables, and context parameters.
                 For example, if an Auth header and a Name query string param-
                 eter are defined as identity sources, this value is route.re-
                 quest.header.Auth,  route.request.querystring.Name  for  Web-
                 Socket  APIs.  For  HTTP APIs, use selection expressions pre-
                 fixed  with  $,  for  example,   $request.header.Auth,   $re-
                 quest.querystring.Name.  These parameters are used to perform
                 runtime validation for Lambda-based authorizers by  verifying
                 all of the identity-related request parameters are present in
                 the request, not null, and non-empty. Only when this is  true
                 does  the  authorizer  invoke the authorizer Lambda function.
                 Otherwise, it returns a  401  Unauthorized  response  without
                 calling  the Lambda function. For HTTP APIs, identity sources
                 are also used as the cache key when caching  is  enabled.  To
                 learn  more, see Working with AWS Lambda authorizers for HTTP
                 APIs .

                 For JWT, a single entry that specifies where to  extract  the
                 JSON  Web  Token  (JWT) from inbound requests. Currently only
                 header-based and query parameter-based  selections  are  sup-
                 ported, for example $request.header.Authorization.

                 (string)

              IdentityValidationExpression -> (string)
                 The  validation  expression does not apply to the REQUEST au-
                 thorizer.

              JwtConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Represents the configuration of a  JWT  authorizer.  Required
                 for the JWT authorizer type. Supported only for HTTP APIs.

                 Audience -> (list)
                     A list of the intended recipients of the JWT. A valid JWT
                     must provide an aud that matches at least  one  entry  in
                     this list. See RFC 7519 . Supported only for HTTP APIs.

                     (string)

                 Issuer -> (string)
                     The base domain of the identity provider that issues JSON
                     Web Tokens. For example, an Amazon Cognito user pool  has
                     the                   following                   format:
                     https://cognito-idp.{region}.amazonaws.com/{userPoolId}.
                     Required  for the JWT authorizer type. Supported only for
                     HTTP APIs.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the authorizer.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The next page of elements from this collection. Not  valid  for  the
          last element of the collection.



                                                             GET-AUTHORIZERS()
