NAME
       get-integration-response -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets an IntegrationResponses.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-integration-response
          --api-id <value>
          --integration-id <value>
          --integration-response-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --api-id (string)
          The API identifier.

       --integration-id (string)
          The integration ID.

       --integration-response-id (string)
          The integration response ID.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ContentHandlingStrategy -> (string)
          Supported only for WebSocket APIs. Specifies how to handle  response
          payload   content   type  conversions.  Supported  values  are  CON-
          VERT_TO_BINARY and CONVERT_TO_TEXT, with the following behaviors:

          CONVERT_TO_BINARY: Converts a response payload from a Base64-encoded
          string to the corresponding binary blob.

          CONVERT_TO_TEXT: Converts a response payload from a binary blob to a
          Base64-encoded string.

          If this property is not defined, the response payload will be passed
          through  from  the  integration  response  to  the route response or
          method response without modification.

       IntegrationResponseId -> (string)
          The integration response ID.

       IntegrationResponseKey -> (string)
          The integration response key.

       ResponseParameters -> (map)
          A key-value map specifying response parameters that  are  passed  to
          the  method  response from the backend. The key is a method response
          header parameter name and the mapped value  is  an  integration  re-
          sponse header value, a static value enclosed within a pair of single
          quotes, or a JSON expression from the integration response body. The
          mapping key must match the pattern of method.response.header.{name},
          where name is a valid and unique header name. The mapped  non-static
          value  must  match the pattern of integration.response.header.{name}
          or  integration.response.body.{JSON-expression},  where  name  is  a
          valid and unique response header name and JSON-expression is a valid
          JSON expression without the $ prefix.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
              A string with a length between [1-512].

       ResponseTemplates -> (map)
          The collection of response templates for the integration response as
          a  string-to-string  map  of key-value pairs. Response templates are
          represented as a key/value map, with a content-type as the key and a
          template as the value.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
              A string with a length between [0-32768].

       TemplateSelectionExpression -> (string)
          The template selection expressions for the integration response.
