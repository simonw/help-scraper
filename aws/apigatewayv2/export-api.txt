          The API identifier.

       --export-version (string)
          The  version  of  the API Gateway export algorithm. API Gateway uses

          JSON and YAML.

          o YAML

          o JSON

       --specification (string)
          The version of the API specification to use. OAS30, for OpenAPI 3.0,
          is the only supported value.

          Possible values:

          o OAS30

       --stage-name (string)
          The name of the API stage to export. If you don't specify this prop-

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To export an OpenAPI definition of an HTTP API

       The following export-api example exports an OpenAPI 3.0  definition  of
       an API stage named prod to a YAML file named stage-definition.yaml. The
       exported definition file includes API Gateway extensions by default.

          aws apigatewayv2 export-api \
              --api-id a1b2c3d4 \
              --output-type YAML \
              --specification OAS30 \
              --stage-name prod \
              stage-definition.yaml

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see Exporting an HTTP API from API Gateway in the
       Amazon API Gateway Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       body -> (blob)
          Represents  an  exported definition of an API in a particular output
          format, for example, YAML. The API is serialized  to  the  requested
          specification, for example, OpenAPI 3.0.
