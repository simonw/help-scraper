GET-ROUTES()                                                      GET-ROUTES()



NAME
       get-routes -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the Routes for an API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-routes  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Items

SYNOPSIS
            get-routes
          --api-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --api-id (string)
          The API identifier.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (string)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve a list of routes

       The  following  get-routes  example  displays a list of all of an API's
       routes.

          aws apigatewayv2 get-routes \
              --api-id a1b2c3d4

       Output:

          {
              "Items": [
                  {
                      "ApiKeyRequired": false,
                      "AuthorizationType": "NONE",
                      "RouteId": "72jz1wk",
                      "RouteKey": "ANY /admin",
                      "Target": "integrations/a1b2c3"
                  },
                  {
                      "ApiGatewayManaged": true,
                      "ApiKeyRequired": false,
                      "AuthorizationType": "NONE",
                      "RouteId": "go65gqi",
                      "RouteKey": "$default",
                      "Target": "integrations/a1b2c4"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Items -> (list)
          The elements from this collection.

          (structure)
              Represents a route.

              ApiGatewayManaged -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  a route is managed by API Gateway. If you
                 created an API using quick create, the $default route is man-
                 aged by API Gateway. You can't modify the $default route key.

              ApiKeyRequired -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether an API key is required for this route. Sup-
                 ported only for WebSocket APIs.

              AuthorizationScopes -> (list)
                 A list of authorization scopes configured  on  a  route.  The
                 scopes are used with a JWT authorizer to authorize the method
                 invocation. The authorization works  by  matching  the  route
                 scopes against the scopes parsed from the access token in the
                 incoming request. The method invocation is authorized if  any
                 route scope matches a claimed scope in the access token. Oth-
                 erwise, the invocation is  not  authorized.  When  the  route
                 scope  is configured, the client must provide an access token
                 instead of an identity token for authorization purposes.

                 (string)
                     A string with a length between [1-64].

              AuthorizationType -> (string)
                 The authorization type for the  route.  For  WebSocket  APIs,
                 valid  values are NONE for open access, AWS_IAM for using AWS
                 IAM permissions, and CUSTOM for using a Lambda authorizer For
                 HTTP APIs, valid values are NONE for open access, JWT for us-
                 ing JSON Web Tokens, AWS_IAM for using AWS  IAM  permissions,
                 and CUSTOM for using a Lambda authorizer.

              AuthorizerId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  of  the Authorizer resource to be associated
                 with this route. The authorizer identifier  is  generated  by
                 API Gateway when you created the authorizer.

              ModelSelectionExpression -> (string)
                 The  model selection expression for the route. Supported only
                 for WebSocket APIs.

              OperationName -> (string)
                 The operation name for the route.

              RequestModels -> (map)
                 The request models for the route.  Supported  only  for  Web-
                 Socket APIs.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)
                     A string with a length between [1-128].

              RequestParameters -> (map)
                 The request parameters for the route. Supported only for Web-
                 Socket APIs.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     Validation constraints imposed on parameters of a request
                     (path, query string, headers).

                     Required -> (boolean)
                        Whether or not the parameter is required.

              RouteId -> (string)
                 The route ID.

              RouteKey -> (string)
                 The route key for the route.

              RouteResponseSelectionExpression -> (string)
                 The  route  response selection expression for the route. Sup-
                 ported only for WebSocket APIs.

              Target -> (string)
                 The target for the route.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The next page of elements from this collection. Not  valid  for  the
          last element of the collection.
