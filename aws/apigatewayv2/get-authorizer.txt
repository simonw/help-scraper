GET-AUTHORIZER()                                              GET-AUTHORIZER()



NAME
       get-authorizer -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets an Authorizer.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-authorizer
          --api-id <value>
          --authorizer-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --api-id (string)
          The API identifier.

       --authorizer-id (string)
          The authorizer identifier.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve information about an authorizer

       The  following get-authorizer example displays information about an au-
       thorizer.

          aws apigatewayv2 get-authorizer \
              --api-id a1b2c3d4 \
              --authorizer-id a1b2c3

       Output:

          {
              "AuthorizerId": "a1b2c3",
              "AuthorizerType": "JWT",
              "IdentitySource": [
                  "$request.header.Authorization"
              ],
              "JwtConfiguration": {
                  "Audience": [
                      "123456abc"
                  ],
                  "Issuer": "https://cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/us-west-2_abc123"
              },
              "Name": "my-jwt-authorizer"
          }

       For more information, see Controlling access to HTTP APIs with JWT  au-
       thorizers in the Amazon API Gateway Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       AuthorizerCredentialsArn -> (string)
          Specifies the required credentials as an IAM role for API Gateway to
          invoke the authorizer. To specify an IAM role for API Gateway to as-
          sume,  use  the  role's  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN).  To  use re-
          source-based permissions on the Lambda function, don't specify  this
          parameter. Supported only for REQUEST authorizers.

       AuthorizerId -> (string)
          The authorizer identifier.

       AuthorizerPayloadFormatVersion -> (string)
          Specifies  the  format of the payload sent to an HTTP API Lambda au-
          thorizer. Required for HTTP API Lambda authorizers. Supported values
          are  1.0  and 2.0. To learn more, see Working with AWS Lambda autho-
          rizers for HTTP APIs .

       AuthorizerResultTtlInSeconds -> (integer)
          The time to live (TTL) for cached authorizer results, in seconds. If
          it  equals  0,  authorization  caching is disabled. If it is greater
          than 0, API Gateway caches authorizer responses. The  maximum  value
          is 3600, or 1 hour. Supported only for HTTP API Lambda authorizers.

       AuthorizerType -> (string)
          The authorizer type. Specify REQUEST for a Lambda function using in-
          coming request parameters. Specify JWT to use JSON Web Tokens  (sup-
          ported only for HTTP APIs).

       AuthorizerUri -> (string)
          The  authorizer's Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). For REQUEST au-
          thorizers, this must be a well-formed Lambda function URI, for exam-
          ple,       arn:aws:apigateway:us-west-2:lambda:path/2015-03-31/func-
          tions/arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:{account_id}:function:{lambda_func-
          tion_name}/invocations.   In   general,   the  URI  has  this  form:
          arn:aws:apigateway:{region}:lambda:path/{service_api},  where   {re-
          gion}  is  the  same as the region hosting the Lambda function, path
          indicates that the remaining substring in the URI should be  treated
          as  the  path  to  the resource, including the initial /. For Lambda
          functions, this is usually of the form  /2015-03-31/functions/[Func-
          tionARN]/invocations. Supported only for REQUEST authorizers.

       EnableSimpleResponses -> (boolean)
          Specifies whether a Lambda authorizer returns a response in a simple
          format. If enabled, the Lambda authorizer can return a boolean value
          instead  of  an  IAM  policy. Supported only for HTTP APIs. To learn
          more, see Working with AWS Lambda authorizers for HTTP APIs

       IdentitySource -> (list)
          The identity source for which authorization is requested.

          For a REQUEST authorizer, this is optional. The value is  a  set  of
          one or more mapping expressions of the specified request parameters.
          The identity source can be headers, query string  parameters,  stage
          variables,  and  context  parameters. For example, if an Auth header
          and a Name query string parameter are defined as  identity  sources,
          this   value   is  route.request.header.Auth,  route.request.querys-
          tring.Name for WebSocket APIs. For HTTP APIs, use selection  expres-
          sions  prefixed  with  $,  for  example,  $request.header.Auth, $re-
          quest.querystring.Name. These parameters are used to perform runtime
          validation  for  Lambda-based  authorizers  by  verifying all of the
          identity-related request parameters are present in the request,  not
          null,  and non-empty. Only when this is true does the authorizer in-
          voke the authorizer Lambda function. Otherwise,  it  returns  a  401
          Unauthorized  response without calling the Lambda function. For HTTP
          APIs, identity sources are also used as the cache key  when  caching
          is  enabled.  To learn more, see Working with AWS Lambda authorizers
          for HTTP APIs .

          For JWT, a single entry that specifies where to extract the JSON Web
          Token  (JWT)  from inbound requests. Currently only header-based and
          query parameter-based selections are  supported,  for  example  $re-
          quest.header.Authorization.

          (string)

       IdentityValidationExpression -> (string)
          The validation expression does not apply to the REQUEST authorizer.

       JwtConfiguration -> (structure)
          Represents  the  configuration of a JWT authorizer. Required for the
          JWT authorizer type. Supported only for HTTP APIs.

          Audience -> (list)
              A list of the intended recipients of the JWT. A valid  JWT  must
              provide an aud that matches at least one entry in this list. See
              RFC 7519 . Supported only for HTTP APIs.

              (string)

          Issuer -> (string)
              The base domain of the identity provider that  issues  JSON  Web
              Tokens. For example, an Amazon Cognito user pool has the follow-
              ing                                                      format:
              https://cognito-idp.{region}.amazonaws.com/{userPoolId}.     Re-
              quired for the JWT authorizer  type.  Supported  only  for  HTTP
              APIs.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the authorizer.
