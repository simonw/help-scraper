GET-DOMAIN-NAME()                                            GET-DOMAIN-NAME()



NAME
       get-domain-name -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a domain name.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-domain-name
          --domain-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The domain name.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve information about a custom domain name

       The following get-domain-name example displays information about a cus-
       tom domain name.

          aws apigatewayv2 get-domain-name \
              --domain-name api.example.com

       Output:

          {
              "ApiMappingSelectionExpression": "$request.basepath",
              "DomainName": "api.example.com",
              "DomainNameConfigurations": [
                  {
                      "ApiGatewayDomainName": "d-1234.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com",
                      "CertificateArn": "arn:aws:acm:us-west-2:123456789012:certificate/123456789012-1234-1234-1234-12345678",

                      "DomainNameStatus": "AVAILABLE"
                  }
              ],
              "Tags": {}

                 A domain name for the API.

              CertificateArn -> (string)
                 An  AWS-managed certificate that will be used by the edge-op-
                 timized endpoint for this domain name. AWS  Certificate  Man-
                 ager is the only supported source.

              CertificateName -> (string)
                 The  user-friendly  name of the certificate that will be used
                 by the edge-optimized endpoint for this domain name.

              CertificateUploadDate -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp when the certificate that was used by  edge-op-
                 timized endpoint for this domain name was uploaded.

              DomainNameStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the domain name migration. The valid values are
                 AVAILABLE, UPDATING, PENDING_CERTIFICATE_REIMPORT, and  PEND-
                 ING_OWNERSHIP_VERIFICATION.  If  the  status is UPDATING, the
                 domain cannot be modified further until the  existing  opera-
                 tion  is  complete. If it is AVAILABLE, the domain can be up-
                 dated.

              DomainNameStatusMessage -> (string)

                 TLS_1_2.

              OwnershipVerificationCertificateArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of the public certificate issued by ACM to validate
                 ownership of your custom domain. Only required when configur-
                 ing  mutual  TLS and using an ACM imported or private CA cer-
                 tificate ARN as the regionalCertificateArn

       MutualTlsAuthentication -> (structure)
          The mutual TLS authentication  configuration  for  a  custom  domain
          name.

          TruststoreUri -> (string)
              An  Amazon  S3  URL that specifies the truststore for mutual TLS
              authentication,  for  example,  s3://bucket-name/key-name.   The
              truststore  can contain certificates from public or private cer-
              tificate authorities. To update the  truststore,  upload  a  new
              version  to  S3,  and then update your custom domain name to use
              the new version. To update the truststore, you must have permis-
              sions to access the S3 object.

          TruststoreVersion -> (string)
              The  version  of the S3 object that contains your truststore. To
              specify a version, you must have versioning enabled for  the  S3
              bucket.

          TruststoreWarnings -> (list)
              A  list  of  warnings  that API Gateway returns while processing
              your truststore. Invalid certificates produce  warnings.  Mutual
              TLS  is still enabled, but some clients might not be able to ac-
              cess your API. To resolve warnings, upload a new  truststore  to
              S3, and then update you domain name to use the new version.

              (string)

       Tags -> (map)

          key -> (string)
