       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-integration-response
          --api-id <value>
          [--content-handling-strategy <value>]
          --integration-id <value>
          --integration-response-id <value>
          [--integration-response-key <value>]
          [--response-parameters <value>]
          [--response-templates <value>]
          [--template-selection-expression <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --api-id (string)
          The API identifier.

       --content-handling-strategy (string)
          Supported  only for WebSocket APIs. Specifies how to handle response
          payload  content  type  conversions.  Supported  values   are   CON-
          VERT_TO_BINARY and CONVERT_TO_TEXT, with the following behaviors:

          CONVERT_TO_BINARY: Converts a response payload from a Base64-encoded
          string to the corresponding binary blob.

          CONVERT_TO_TEXT: Converts a response payload from a binary blob to a
          Base64-encoded string.

          If this property is not defined, the response payload will be passed
          through from the integration  response  to  the  route  response  or
          method response without modification.

          Possible values:

          o CONVERT_TO_BINARY

          o CONVERT_TO_TEXT

       --integration-id (string)
          The integration ID.

       --integration-response-id (string)
          The integration response ID.

       --integration-response-key (string)
          The integration response key.

       --response-parameters (map)
          A  key-value  map  specifying response parameters that are passed to
          the method response from the backend. The key is a  method  response
          header  parameter  name  and  the mapped value is an integration re-
          sponse header value, a static value enclosed within a pair of single
          quotes, or a JSON expression from the integration response body. The
          mapping key must match the pattern of method.response.header.{name},
          where  name is a valid and unique header name. The mapped non-static
          value must match the pattern of integration.response.header.{name}or
          integration.response.body.{JSON-expression},  where {name}is a valid
          and unique response header name and {JSON-expression}is a valid JSON
          expression without the $ prefix.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
              A string with a length between [1-512].

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --response-templates (map)
          The collection of response templates for the integration response as
          a string-to-string map of key-value pairs.  Response  templates  are
          represented as a key/value map, with a content-type as the key and a
          template as the value.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
              A string with a length between [0-32768].

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --template-selection-expression (string)
          The template selection expression for the integration response. Sup-
          ported only for WebSocket APIs.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       ResponseParameters -> (map)
          A key-value map specifying response parameters that  are  passed  to

          header parameter name and the mapped value  is  an  integration  re-
          sponse header value, a static value enclosed within a pair of single
