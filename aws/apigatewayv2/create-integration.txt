          The API identifier.

       --connection-id (string)
          The ID of the VPC link for a private integration. Supported only for
          HTTP APIs.

       --connection-type (string)
          The type of the network  connection  to  the  integration  endpoint.
          Specify  INTERNET for connections through the public routable inter-
          net or VPC_LINK for private connections between API Gateway and  re-
          sources in a VPC. The default value is INTERNET.

          Possible values:

          o INTERNET

          o VPC_LINK

       --content-handling-strategy (string)
          Supported  only for WebSocket APIs. Specifies how to handle response
          payload  content  type  conversions.  Supported  values   are   CON-
          VERT_TO_BINARY and CONVERT_TO_TEXT, with the following behaviors:

          CONVERT_TO_BINARY: Converts a response payload from a Base64-encoded
          string to the corresponding binary blob.

          CONVERT_TO_TEXT: Converts a response payload from a binary blob to a
          Base64-encoded string.

          If this property is not defined, the response payload will be passed
          through from the integration  response  to  the  route  response  or
          method response without modification.

          Possible values:

          o CONVERT_TO_BINARY

          o CONVERT_TO_TEXT

       --credentials-arn (string)
          Specifies  the credentials required for the integration, if any. For
          AWS integrations, three options are available.  To  specify  an  IAM
          Role  for API Gateway to assume, use the role's Amazon Resource Name
          (ARN). To require that the caller's identity be passed through  from
          the  request,  specify  the  string  arn:aws:iam:::user/. To use re-
          source-based permissions on supported AWS services, specify null.

       --description (string)
          The description of the integration.

       --integration-method (string)
          Specifies the integration's HTTP method type.

       --integration-subtype (string)
          Supported only for HTTP API AWS_PROXY  integrations.  Specifies  the
          AWS service action to invoke. To learn more, see Integration subtype
          reference .

       --integration-type (string)
          The integration type of an integration. One of the following:

          AWS: for integrating the route or method request with an AWS service
          action,  including  the  Lambda  function-invoking  action. With the
          Lambda function-invoking action, this is referred to as  the  Lambda
          custom integration. With any other AWS service action, this is known
          as AWS integration. Supported only for WebSocket APIs.

          AWS_PROXY: for integrating the route or method request with a Lambda
          function  or  other AWS service action. This integration is also re-
          ferred to as a Lambda proxy integration.

          HTTP: for integrating the route or method request with an HTTP  end-
          point. This integration is also referred to as the HTTP custom inte-
          gration. Supported only for WebSocket APIs.

          HTTP_PROXY: for integrating the route or method request with an HTTP
          endpoint, with the client request passed through as-is. This is also
          referred to as HTTP proxy integration. For HTTP API private integra-
          tions, use an HTTP_PROXY integration.

          MOCK:  for  integrating the route or method request with API Gateway
          as a "loopback" endpoint without  invoking  any  backend.  Supported
          only for WebSocket APIs.

          Possible values:

          o AWS

          o HTTP

          o MOCK

          o HTTP_PROXY

          o AWS_PROXY

       --integration-uri (string)
          For a Lambda integration, specify the URI of a Lambda function.

          For an HTTP integration, specify a fully-qualified URL.

          For  an HTTP API private integration, specify the ARN of an Applica-
          tion Load Balancer listener, Network Load Balancer listener, or  AWS
          Cloud  Map  service. If you specify the ARN of an AWS Cloud Map ser-
          vice, API Gateway uses DiscoverInstances to identify resources.  You
          can  use  query  parameters  to  target specific resources. To learn
          more, see DiscoverInstances .  For  private  integrations,  all  re-
          sources must be owned by the same AWS account.

       --passthrough-behavior (string)
          Specifies  the  pass-through behavior for incoming requests based on
          the Content-Type header in the request, and  the  available  mapping
          templates specified as the requestTemplates property on the Integra-
          tion  resource.  There  are  three  valid   values:   WHEN_NO_MATCH,
          WHEN_NO_TEMPLATES, and NEVER. Supported only for WebSocket APIs.

          WHEN_NO_MATCH  passes  the  request  body for unmapped content types
          through to the integration backend without transformation.

          NEVER rejects unmapped content types with an  HTTP  415  Unsupported
          Media Type response.

          WHEN_NO_TEMPLATES  allows  pass-through  when the integration has no
          content types mapped to templates. However, if there is at least one
          content  type  defined, unmapped content types will be rejected with
          the same HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type response.

          Possible values:

          o WHEN_NO_MATCH

          o NEVER

          o WHEN_NO_TEMPLATES

       --payload-format-version (string)
          Specifies the format of the payload sent to an integration. Required
          for HTTP APIs.

       --request-parameters (map)
          For  WebSocket  APIs,  a key-value map specifying request parameters
          that are passed from the method request to the backend. The  key  is
          an  integration request parameter name and the associated value is a
          method request parameter value or static value that must be enclosed
          within single quotes and pre-encoded as required by the backend. The
          method request parameter value must match the pattern of  method.re-
          quest.{location}.{name},  where  {location}is  querystring, path, or
          header; and {name}must be a valid and unique method request  parame-
          ter name.

          For  HTTP  API integrations with a specified integrationSubtype, re-
          quest parameters are a key-value map specifying parameters that  are
          passed  to AWS_PROXY integrations. You can provide static values, or
          map request data, stage variables, or  context  variables  that  are
          evaluated  at  runtime.  To learn more, see Working with AWS service
          integrations for HTTP APIs .

          For HTTP API integrations without a specified integrationSubtype re-
          quest  parameters  are  a  key-value map specifying how to transform
          HTTP requests before sending them to the  backend.  The  key  should
          follow   the  pattern  <action>:<header|querystring|path>.<location>
          where action can be append, overwrite or remove. For values, you can
          provide static values, or map request data, stage variables, or con-
          text variables that are evaluated at runtime.  To  learn  more,  see
          Transforming API requests and responses .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
              A string with a length between [1-512].

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --request-templates (map)
          Represents  a  map of Velocity templates that are applied on the re-
          quest payload based on the value of the Content-Type header sent  by
          the  client.  The content type value is the key in this map, and the
          template (as a String) is the value. Supported  only  for  WebSocket
          APIs.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
              A string with a length between [0-32768].

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --response-parameters (map)
          Supported  only for HTTP APIs. You use response parameters to trans-
          form the HTTP response from a backend integration  before  returning
          the  response  to  clients. Specify a key-value map from a selection
          key to response parameters. The selection key must be a  valid  HTTP
          status  code  within the range of 200-599. Response parameters are a
          key-value map. The key must match  pattern  <action>:<header>.<loca-
          tion>  or  overwrite.statuscode. The action can be append, overwrite
          or remove. The value can be a static value, or map to response data,
          stage variables, or context variables that are evaluated at runtime.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (map)
              For WebSocket APIs, a key-value map specifying  request  parame-
              ters that are passed from the method request to the backend. The
              key is an integration request parameter name and the  associated
              value  is  a method request parameter value or static value that
              must be enclosed within single quotes  and  pre-encoded  as  re-
              quired  by  the backend. The method request parameter value must
              match the  pattern  of  method.request.{location}.{name},  where
              {location}is  querystring,  path, or header; and {name}must be a
              valid and unique method request parameter name.

              For HTTP API integrations with a  specified  integrationSubtype,
              request  parameters  are  a  key-value map specifying parameters
              that are passed  to  AWS_PROXY  integrations.  You  can  provide
              static  values, or map request data, stage variables, or context
              variables that are evaluated at  runtime.  To  learn  more,  see
              Working with AWS service integrations for HTTP APIs .

              For HTTP API integrations without a specified integrationSubtype
              request parameters are a key-value map specifying how to  trans-
              form  HTTP  requests before sending them to the backend. The key

              tring|path>.<location>  where action can be append, overwrite or
              remove. For values, you can provide static values,  or  map  re-
              quest data, stage variables, or context variables that are eval-
              uated at runtime. To learn more, see Transforming  API  requests
              and responses .

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)
                 A string with a length between [1-512].

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string,KeyName2=KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {"string": "string"
                ...}
            ...}

       --template-selection-expression (string)
          The template selection expression for the integration.

       --timeout-in-millis (integer)
          Custom timeout between 50 and 29,000 milliseconds for WebSocket APIs
          and between 50 and 30,000 milliseconds for HTTP  APIs.  The  default
          timeout  is  29  seconds  for WebSocket APIs and 30 seconds for HTTP
          APIs.

       --tls-config (structure)
          The TLS configuration for a private integration. If  you  specify  a
          TLS configuration, private integration traffic uses the HTTPS proto-
          col. Supported only for HTTP APIs.

          ServerNameToVerify -> (string)
              If you specify a server name, API Gateway uses it to verify  the
              hostname  on  the  integration's certificate. The server name is
              also included in the TLS handshake to support Server Name  Indi-
              cation (SNI) or virtual hosting.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ServerNameToVerify=string

       JSON Syntax:

          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

          Specifies  whether  an integration is managed by API Gateway. If you
          created an API using using quick create, the  resulting  integration
          is managed by API Gateway. You can update a managed integration, but
          you can't delete it.

       ConnectionId -> (string)
          The ID of the VPC link for a private integration. Supported only for
          HTTP APIs.

       ConnectionType -> (string)
          The  type  of  the  network  connection to the integration endpoint.
          Specify INTERNET for connections through the public routable  inter-
          net  or VPC_LINK for private connections between API Gateway and re-
          sources in a VPC. The default value is INTERNET.

       ContentHandlingStrategy -> (string)
          Supported only for WebSocket APIs. Specifies how to handle  response
          payload   content   type  conversions.  Supported  values  are  CON-

          Cloud  Map  service. If you specify the ARN of an AWS Cloud Map ser-
          vice, API Gateway uses DiscoverInstances to identify resources.  You
          can  use  query  parameters  to  target specific resources. To learn
          more, see DiscoverInstances .  For  private  integrations,  all  re-
          sources must be owned by the same AWS account.

       PassthroughBehavior -> (string)
          Specifies  the  pass-through behavior for incoming requests based on
          the Content-Type header in the request, and  the  available  mapping
          templates specified as the requestTemplates property on the Integra-
          tion  resource.  There  are  three  valid   values:   WHEN_NO_MATCH,
          WHEN_NO_TEMPLATES, and NEVER. Supported only for WebSocket APIs.

          WHEN_NO_MATCH  passes  the  request  body for unmapped content types
          through to the integration backend without transformation.

          NEVER rejects unmapped content types with an  HTTP  415  Unsupported
          Media Type response.

          WHEN_NO_TEMPLATES  allows  pass-through  when the integration has no
          content types mapped to templates. However, if there is at least one
          content  type  defined, unmapped content types will be rejected with
          the same HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type response.

       PayloadFormatVersion -> (string)
          Specifies the format of the payload sent to an integration. Required
          for HTTP APIs.

       RequestParameters -> (map)
          For  WebSocket  APIs,  a key-value map specifying request parameters
          that are passed from the method request to the backend. The  key  is
          an  integration request parameter name and the associated value is a
          method request parameter value or static value that must be enclosed
          within single quotes and pre-encoded as required by the backend. The
          method request parameter value must match the pattern of  method.re-
          quest.{location}.{name},  where  {location}is  querystring, path, or
          header; and {name}must be a valid and unique method request  parame-
          ter name.

          For  HTTP  API integrations with a specified integrationSubtype, re-
          quest parameters are a key-value map specifying parameters that  are
          passed  to AWS_PROXY integrations. You can provide static values, or
          map request data, stage variables, or  context  variables  that  are
          evaluated  at  runtime.  To learn more, see Working with AWS service
          integrations for HTTP APIs .

          For HTTP API itegrations, without a specified integrationSubtype re-
          quest  parameters  are  a  key-value map specifying how to transform
          HTTP requests before sending them to backend integrations.  The  key
          should  follow the pattern <action>:<header|querystring|path>.<loca-
          tion>. The action can be append, overwrite or  remove.  For  values,
          you can provide static values, or map request data, stage variables,
          or context variables that are evaluated at runtime. To  learn  more,
          see Transforming API requests and responses .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
              A string with a length between [1-512].

       RequestTemplates -> (map)
          Represents  a  map of Velocity templates that are applied on the re-
          quest payload based on the value of the Content-Type header sent  by
          the  client.  The content type value is the key in this map, and the
          template (as a String) is the value. Supported  only  for  WebSocket
          APIs.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
              A string with a length between [0-32768].

       ResponseParameters -> (map)
          Supported  only for HTTP APIs. You use response parameters to trans-
          form the HTTP response from a backend integration  before  returning
          the  response  to  clients. Specify a key-value map from a selection
          key to response parameters. The selection key must be a  valid  HTTP
          status  code  within the range of 200-599. Response parameters are a
          key-value map. The key must match  pattern  <action>:<header>.<loca-
          tion>  or  overwrite.statuscode. The action can be append, overwrite
          or remove. The value can be a static value, or map to response data,
          stage variables, or context variables that are evaluated at runtime.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (map)
              For WebSocket APIs, a key-value map specifying  request  parame-
              ters that are passed from the method request to the backend. The
              key is an integration request parameter name and the  associated
              value  is  a method request parameter value or static value that
              must be enclosed within single quotes  and  pre-encoded  as  re-
              quired  by  the backend. The method request parameter value must
              match the  pattern  of  method.request.{location}.{name},  where
              {location}is  querystring,  path, or header; and {name}must be a
              valid and unique method request parameter name.

              For HTTP API integrations with a  specified  integrationSubtype,
              request  parameters  are  a  key-value map specifying parameters
              that are passed  to  AWS_PROXY  integrations.  You  can  provide
              static  values, or map request data, stage variables, or context
              variables that are evaluated at  runtime.  To  learn  more,  see
              Working with AWS service integrations for HTTP APIs .

              For HTTP API integrations without a specified integrationSubtype
              request parameters are a key-value map specifying how to  trans-
              form  HTTP  requests before sending them to the backend. The key
              should    follow    the     pattern     <action>:<header|querys-
              tring|path>.<location>  where action can be append, overwrite or
              remove. For values, you can provide static values,  or  map  re-
              quest data, stage variables, or context variables that are eval-
              uated at runtime. To learn more, see Transforming  API  requests
              and responses .

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)
                 A string with a length between [1-512].

       TemplateSelectionExpression -> (string)
          The  template  selection  expression  for the integration. Supported
          only for WebSocket APIs.

       TimeoutInMillis -> (integer)
          Custom timeout between 50 and 29,000 milliseconds for WebSocket APIs
          and  between  50  and 30,000 milliseconds for HTTP APIs. The default
          timeout is 29 seconds for WebSocket APIs and  30  seconds  for  HTTP
          APIs.

       TlsConfig -> (structure)
          The  TLS  configuration  for a private integration. If you specify a
          TLS configuration, private integration traffic uses the HTTPS proto-
          col. Supported only for HTTP APIs.

          ServerNameToVerify -> (string)
              If  you specify a server name, API Gateway uses it to verify the
              hostname on the integration's certificate. The  server  name  is
              also  included in the TLS handshake to support Server Name Indi-
              cation (SNI) or virtual hosting.
