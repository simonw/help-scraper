DESCRIBE-GROUPS()                                            DESCRIBE-GROUPS()



NAME
       describe-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the groups specified by the query. Groups are defined by the
       underlying Active Directory.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-groups is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Groups

SYNOPSIS
            describe-groups
          [--authentication-token <value>]
          --search-query <value>
          [--organization-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --authentication-token (string)
          Amazon  WorkDocs  authentication  token. Not required when using AWS
          administrator credentials to access the API.

       --search-query (string)
          A query to describe groups by group name.

       --organization-id (string)
          The ID of the organization.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve a list of groups

       The  following describe-groups example lists the groups associated with
       the specified Amazon WorkDocs organization.

          aws workdocs describe-groups \
              --search-query "e" \
              --organization-id d-123456789c

       Output:

          {
              "Groups": [
                  {
                      "Id": "S-1-1-11-1122222222-2222233333-3333334444-4444&d-123456789c",
                      "Name": "Example Group 1"
                  },
                  {
                      "Id": "S-1-1-11-1122222222-2222233333-3333334444-5555&d-123456789c",
                      "Name": "Example Group 2"
                  }
              ]
          }

          The list of groups.

          (structure)

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID of the user group.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the group.

       Marker -> (string)
          The  marker to use when requesting the next set of results. If there
          are no additional results, the string is empty.
