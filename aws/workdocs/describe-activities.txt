DESCRIBE-ACTIVITIES()                                    DESCRIBE-ACTIVITIES()



NAME
       describe-activities -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the user activities in a specified time period.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-activities is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: UserActivities

SYNOPSIS
            describe-activities
          [--authentication-token <value>]
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--organization-id <value>]
          [--activity-types <value>]
          [--resource-id <value>]
          [--user-id <value>]
          [--include-indirect-activities | --no-include-indirect-activities]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --authentication-token (string)
          Amazon WorkDocs authentication token. Not required  when  using  AWS
          administrator credentials to access the API.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The  timestamp  that determines the starting time of the activities.
          The response includes the activities performed after  the  specified
          timestamp.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The  timestamp  that  determines the end time of the activities. The
          response includes the  activities  performed  before  the  specified
          timestamp.

       --organization-id (string)
          The ID of the organization. This is a mandatory parameter when using
          administrative API (SigV4) requests.

       --activity-types (string)
          Specifies which activity types to include in the response.  If  this
          field is left empty, all activity types are returned.

       --resource-id (string)
          The document or folder ID for which to describe activity types.

       --user-id (string)
          The  ID  of the user who performed the action. The response includes
          activities pertaining to this user. This is  an  optional  parameter
          and is only applicable for administrative API (SigV4) requests.

       --include-indirect-activities | --no-include-indirect-activities (bool-
       ean)
          Includes indirect activities. An indirect activity  results  from  a
          direct activity performed on a parent resource. For example, sharing
          a parent folder (the direct activity) shares all of  the  subfolders
          and documents within the parent folder (the indirect activity).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get a list of user activities

       This example returns a list of the latest user activities for the spec-
       ified organization, with a limit set for the latest two activities.

       Command:

          aws workdocs describe-activities --organization-id d-926726012c --limit 2
