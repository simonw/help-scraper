GET-LOGIN()                                                        GET-LOGIN()



NAME
       get-login -

DESCRIPTION
          Note: This command is deprecated. Use get-login-password instead.

       To log in to an Amazon ECR registry

       This  command retrieves an authentication token using the GetAuthoriza-
       tionToken API, and then it prints a docker login command with  the  au-
       thorization  token  and, if you specified a registry ID, the URI for an
       Amazon ECR registry. You can execute the printed command  to  authenti-
       cate  to  the  registry with Docker. After you have authenticated to an
       Amazon ECR registry with this command, you can use the  Docker  CLI  to
       push  and  pull  images  to  and from that registry as long as your IAM
       principal has access to do so until the token expires.  The  authoriza-
       tion token is valid for 12 hours.

       NOTE:
          This command displays docker login commands to stdout with authenti-
          cation credentials. Your credentials could be visible by other users
          on  your  system  in a process list display or a command history. If
          you are not on a secure system, you should consider  this  risk  and
          login interactively. For more information, see get-authorization-to-
          ken.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-login
          [--registry-ids <value> [<value>...]]
          [--include-email | --no-include-email]

OPTIONS
       --registry-ids (string) A list of AWS account IDs  that  correspond  to
       the Amazon ECR registries that you want to log in to.

       --include-email | --no-include-email (boolean) Specify if the '-e' flag
       should be included in the 'docker login' command. The '-e'  option  has
       been  deprecated  and is removed in Docker version 17.06 and later. You
       must specify --no-include-email if you're using Docker version 17.06 or
       later.  The default behavior is to include the '-e' flag in the 'docker
       login' output.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve a Docker login command to your default registry

       This example prints a command that you can use to log in  to  your  de-
       fault Amazon ECR registry.

       Command:

          aws ecr get-login

       Output:

          docker login -u AWS -p <password> -e none https://<aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com

       To log in to another account's registry

       This  example prints one or more commands that you can use to log in to
       Amazon ECR registries associated with other accounts.

       Command:

          aws ecr get-login --registry-ids 012345678910 023456789012

       Output:

          docker login -u <username> -p <token-1> -e none <endpoint-1>
          docker login -u <username> -p <token-2> -e none <endpoint-2>



                                                                   GET-LOGIN()
