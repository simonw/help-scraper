DESCRIBE-IMAGES()                                            DESCRIBE-IMAGES()



NAME
       describe-images -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns metadata about the images in a repository.

       NOTE:
          Beginning  with Docker version 1.9, the Docker client compresses im-
          age layers before pushing them to a V2 Docker registry.  The  output
          of  the  docker images command shows the uncompressed image size, so
          it may return a larger image size than the image sizes  returned  by
          DescribeImages .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-images is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: imageDetails

SYNOPSIS
            describe-images
          [--registry-id <value>]
          --repository-name <value>
          [--image-ids <value>]
          [--filter <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the registry that
          contains  the  repository in which to describe images. If you do not
          specify a registry, the default registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The repository that contains the images to describe.

       --image-ids (list)
          The list of image IDs for the requested repository.

          (structure)
              An object with identifying information for an image in an Amazon
              ECR repository.

              imageDigest -> (string)
                 The sha256 digest of the image manifest.

              imageTag -> (string)
                 The tag used for the image.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          imageDigest=string,imageTag=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "imageDigest": "string",
              "imageTag": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --filter (structure)
          The  filter  key  and value with which to filter your DescribeImages
          results.

          tagStatus -> (string)
              The tag status with which to  filter  your   DescribeImages  re-
              sults.  You  can filter results based on whether they are TAGGED
              or UNTAGGED .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          tagStatus=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "tagStatus": "TAGGED"|"UNTAGGED"|"ANY"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe an image in a repository

       The folowing describe-images example displays details about an image in
       the cluster-autoscaler repository with the tag v1.13.6.

          aws ecr describe-images \
              --repository-name cluster-autoscaler \
              --image-ids imageTag=v1.13.6

                 istry to which this image belongs.

              repositoryName -> (string)

                 If the image is a manifest list, this will be the max size of
                 all manifests in the list.

                 NOTE:
                     Beginning with Docker version 1.9, the Docker client com-
                     presses image layers before pushing them to a  V2  Docker
                     registry.  The  output of the docker images command shows
                     the uncompressed image size, so it may  return  a  larger
                     image  size than the image sizes returned by  DescribeIm-
                     ages .

              imagePushedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, expressed in standard JavaScript date for-
                 mat, at which the current image was pushed to the repository.

              imageScanStatus -> (structure)
                 The current state of the scan.

                 status -> (string)
                     The current state of an image scan.

                 description -> (string)
                     The description of the image scan status.

              imageScanFindingsSummary -> (structure)
                 A summary of the last completed image scan.

                 imageScanCompletedAt -> (timestamp)
                     The time of the last completed image scan.

                 vulnerabilitySourceUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                     The time when the vulnerability data was last scanned.

                 findingSeverityCounts -> (map)
                     The image vulnerability counts, sorted by severity.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (integer)

              imageManifestMediaType -> (string)
                 The media type of the image manifest.

              artifactMediaType -> (string)
                 The artifact media type of the image.

              lastRecordedPullTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, expressed in standard JavaScript date for-
                 mat, when Amazon ECR recorded the last image pull.

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon ECR refreshes the last  image  pull  timestamp  at
                     least  once  every  24 hours. For example, if you pull an
                     image once a day then the lastRecordedPullTime  timestamp
                     will  indicate  the  exact  time  that the image was last
                     pulled. However, if you pull an image once an  hour,  be-
                     cause Amazon ECR refreshes the lastRecordedPullTime time-
                     stamp at least once every 24 hours, the result may not be
                     the exact time that the image was last pulled.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  nextToken  value to include in a future DescribeImages request.
          When the results of a DescribeImages  request  exceed  maxResults  ,
          this  value  can  be used to retrieve the next page of results. This
          value is null when there are no more results to return.
