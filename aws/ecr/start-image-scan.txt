START-IMAGE-SCAN()                                          START-IMAGE-SCAN()



NAME
       start-image-scan -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  an  image vulnerability scan. An image scan can only be started
       once per 24 hours on an individual image. This limit includes if an im-
       age  was scanned on initial push. For more information, see Image scan-
       ning in the Amazon Elastic Container Registry User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-image-scan
          [--registry-id <value>]
          --repository-name <value>
          --image-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the registry that
          contains  the repository in which to start an image scan request. If
          you do not specify a registry, the default registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository that contains the images to scan.

       --image-id (structure)
          An object with identifying information for an image in an Amazon ECR
          repository.

          imageDigest -> (string)
              The sha256 digest of the image manifest.

          imageTag -> (string)
              The tag used for the image.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          imageDigest=string,imageTag=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "imageDigest": "string",
            "imageTag": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To start an image vulnerability scan

       The  following  start-image-scan  example  starts an image scan for and
       specified by the image digest in the specified repository.

          aws ecr start-image-scan \
              --repository-name sample-repo \
              --image-id imageDigest=sha256:74b2c688c700ec95a93e478cdb959737c148df3fbf5ea706abe0318726e885e6

       Output:

          {
             "registryId": "012345678910",
             "repositoryName": "sample-repo",
             "imageId": {
                 "imageDigest": "sha256:74b2c688c700ec95a93e478cdb959737c148df3fbf5ea706abe0318726e885e6"
             },
             "imageScanStatus": {
                 "status": "IN_PROGRESS"
             }
          }
