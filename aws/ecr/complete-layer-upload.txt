COMPLETE-LAYER-UPLOAD()                                COMPLETE-LAYER-UPLOAD()



NAME
       complete-layer-upload -

DESCRIPTION
       Informs  Amazon  ECR  that  the  image layer upload has completed for a
       specified registry, repository name, and upload ID. You can  optionally
       provide  a  sha256  digest  of the image layer for data validation pur-
       poses.

       When an image is pushed, the CompleteLayerUpload API is called once per
       each new image layer to verify that the upload has completed.

       NOTE:
          This  operation is used by the Amazon ECR proxy and is not generally
          used by customers for pulling and pushing images. In most cases, you
          should use the docker CLI to pull, tag, and push images.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            complete-layer-upload
          [--registry-id <value>]
          --repository-name <value>
          --upload-id <value>
          --layer-digests <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The  Amazon  Web Services account ID associated with the registry to
          which to upload layers. If you do not specify a  registry,  the  de-
          fault registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository to associate with the image layer.

       --upload-id (string)
          The  upload ID from a previous  InitiateLayerUpload operation to as-
          sociate with the image layer.

       --layer-digests (list)
          The sha256 digest of the image layer.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To complete an image layer upload

       The following complete-layer-upload example completes  an  image  layer
       upload to the layer-test repository.

          aws ecr complete-layer-upload \
              --repository-name layer-test \
              --upload-id 6cb64b8a-9378-0e33-2ab1-b780fab8a9e9 \
              --layer-digests 6cb64b8a-9378-0e33-2ab1-b780fab8a9e9:48074e6d3a68b39aad8ccc002cdad912d4148c0f92b3729323e

       Output:

          {
              "uploadId": "6cb64b8a-9378-0e33-2ab1-b780fab8a9e9",
              "layerDigest": "sha256:9a77f85878aa1906f2020a0ecdf7a7e962d57e882250acd773383224b3fe9a02",
              "repositoryName": "layer-test",
              "registryId": "130757420319"
          }

OUTPUT
       registryId -> (string)
          The registry ID associated with the request.

       repositoryName -> (string)
          The repository name associated with the request.

       uploadId -> (string)
          The upload ID associated with the layer.

       layerDigest -> (string)
          The sha256 digest of the image layer.
