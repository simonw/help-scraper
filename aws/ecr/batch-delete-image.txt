BATCH-DELETE-IMAGE()                                      BATCH-DELETE-IMAGE()



NAME
       batch-delete-image -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  list  of  specified  images within a repository. Images are
       specified with either an imageTag or imageDigest .

       You can remove a tag from an image by specifying  the  image's  tag  in
       your  request. When you remove the last tag from an image, the image is
       deleted from your repository.

       You can completely delete an image (and all of its tags) by  specifying
       the image's digest in your request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-delete-image
          [--registry-id <value>]
          --repository-name <value>
          --image-ids <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the registry that
          contains the image to delete. If you do not specify a registry,  the
          default registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The repository that contains the image to delete.

       --image-ids (list)
          A  list  of image ID references that correspond to images to delete.
          The format of the imageIds reference  is  imageTag=tag  or  imageDi-
          gest=digest .

          (structure)
              An object with identifying information for an image in an Amazon
              ECR repository.

              imageDigest -> (string)
                 The sha256 digest of the image manifest.

              imageTag -> (string)
                 The tag used for the image.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          imageDigest=string,imageTag=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "imageDigest": "string",
              "imageTag": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To delete an image

       The following batch-delete-image example deletes an image with the  tag
       precise  in the specified repository in the default registry for an ac-
       count.

          aws ecr batch-delete-image \
              --repository-name ubuntu \
              --image-ids imageTag=precise

       Output:

          {
              "failures": [],
              "imageIds": [
                  {
                      "imageTag": "precise",
                      "imageDigest": "sha256:19665f1e6d1e504117a1743c0a3d3753086354a38375961f2e665416ef4b1b2f"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Example 2: To delete multiple images

       The following batch-delete-image example deletes all images tagged with
       prod and team1 in the specified repository.

          aws ecr batch-delete-image \
              --repository-name MyRepository \
              --image-ids imageTag=prod imageTag=team1

       Output:

          {
              "imageIds": [
                  {
                      "imageDigest": "sha256:123456789012",
                      "imageTag": "prod"
                  },
                  {
                      "imageDigest": "sha256:567890121234",
                      "imageTag": "team1"
                  }
              ],
              "failures": []
          }
