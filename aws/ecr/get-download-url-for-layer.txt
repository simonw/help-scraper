GET-DOWNLOAD-URL-FOR-LAYER()                      GET-DOWNLOAD-URL-FOR-LAYER()



NAME
       get-download-url-for-layer -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the pre-signed Amazon S3 download URL corresponding to an im-
       age layer. You can only get URLs for image layers that  are  referenced
       in an image.

       When  an image is pulled, the GetDownloadUrlForLayer API is called once
       per image layer that is not already cached.

       NOTE:
          This operation is used by the Amazon ECR proxy and is not  generally
          used by customers for pulling and pushing images. In most cases, you
          should use the docker CLI to pull, tag, and push images.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-download-url-for-layer
          [--registry-id <value>]
          --repository-name <value>
          --layer-digest <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the registry that
          contains  the  image layer to download. If you do not specify a reg-
          istry, the default registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository that is associated with the  image  layer
          to download.

       --layer-digest (string)
          The digest of the image layer to download.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get the download URL of a layer

       The  following get-download-url-for-layer example displays the download
       URL       of        a        layer        with        the        digest
       sha256:6171c7451a50945f8ddd72f7732cc04d7a0d1f48138a426b2e64387fdeb834ed
       in the cluster-autoscaler repository.

          aws ecr get-download-url-for-layer \
              --repository-name cluster-autoscaler  \
              --layer-digest sha256:6171c7451a50945f8ddd72f7732cc04d7a0d1f48138a426b2e64387fdeb834ed
