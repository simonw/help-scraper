INITIATE-LAYER-UPLOAD()                                INITIATE-LAYER-UPLOAD()



NAME
       initiate-layer-upload -

DESCRIPTION
       Notifies Amazon ECR that you intend to upload an image layer.

       When an image is pushed, the InitiateLayerUpload API is called once per
       image layer that has not already been uploaded. Whether or not an image
       layer  has been uploaded is determined by the BatchCheckLayerAvailabil-
       ity API action.

       NOTE:
          This operation is used by the Amazon ECR proxy and is not  generally
          used by customers for pulling and pushing images. In most cases, you
          should use the docker CLI to pull, tag, and push images.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            initiate-layer-upload
          [--registry-id <value>]
          --repository-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the  registry  to
          which you intend to upload layers. If you do not specify a registry,
          the default registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository to which you intend to upload layers.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To initiate an image layer upload

       The  following  initiate-layer-upload  example initiates an image layer
       upload to the layer-test repository.

          aws ecr initiate-layer-upload \
              --repository-name layer-test

       Output:

          {
              "partSize": 10485760,
              "uploadId": "6cb64b8a-9378-0e33-2ab1-b780fab8a9e9"
          }

OUTPUT
       uploadId -> (string)
          The upload ID for the layer upload. This parameter is passed to fur-
          ther  UploadLayerPart and  CompleteLayerUpload operations.

       partSize -> (long)
          The  size,  in  bytes, that Amazon ECR expects future layer part up-
          loads to be.
