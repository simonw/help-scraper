SYNOPSIS
            create-repository
          [--registry-id <value>]
          --repository-name <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--image-tag-mutability <value>]
          [--image-scanning-configuration <value>]
          [--encryption-configuration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the  registry  to
          create the repository. If you do not specify a registry, the default
          registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The name to use for the repository. The repository name may be spec-
          ified  on  its  own  (such as nginx-web-app ) or it can be prepended
          with a namespace to group the repository into a  category  (such  as
          project-a/nginx-web-app ).

       --tags (list)
          The metadata that you apply to the repository to help you categorize
          and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value,
          both  of  which  you  define.  Tag keys can have a maximum character
          length of 128 characters, and tag values can have a  maximum  length
          of 256 characters.

          (structure)
              The metadata that you apply to a resource to help you categorize
              and organize them. Each tag consists of a key  and  an  optional
              value,  both  of  which  you define. Tag keys can have a maximum
              character length of 128 characters, and tag values  can  have  a
              maximum length of 256 characters.

              Key -> (string)
                 One  part  of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  optional  part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --image-tag-mutability (string)
          The tag mutability setting for the repository. If this parameter  is
          omitted,  the default setting of MUTABLE will be used which will al-
          low image tags to be overwritten. If IMMUTABLE is specified, all im-
          age  tags within the repository will be immutable which will prevent
          them from being overwritten.

          Possible values:

          o MUTABLE

          o IMMUTABLE

       --image-scanning-configuration (structure)
          The image scanning configuration for the repository. This determines
          whether  images  are  scanned  for known vulnerabilities after being
          pushed to the repository.

          scanOnPush -> (boolean)
              The setting that determines whether images are scanned after be-
              ing  pushed  to  a  repository.  If set to true , images will be
              scanned after being pushed. If this parameter is not  specified,
              it will default to false and images will not be scanned unless a
              scan is manually started with the API_StartImageScan API.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          scanOnPush=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "scanOnPush": true|false
          }

       --encryption-configuration (structure)
          The encryption configuration for the repository. This determines how
          the contents of your repository are encrypted at rest.

          encryptionType -> (string)
              The encryption type to use.

              If  you use the KMS encryption type, the contents of the reposi-
              tory will be encrypted using  server-side  encryption  with  Key
              Management  Service  key  stored in KMS. When you use KMS to en-
              crypt your data, you can either use the default Amazon Web  Ser-
              vices  managed  KMS  key for Amazon ECR, or specify your own KMS
              key, which  you  already  created.  For  more  information,  see
              Protecting  data  using  server-side  encryption with an KMS key
              stored in Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) in the Amazon  Simple
              Storage Service Console Developer Guide .

              If   you  use  the  AES256  encryption  type,  Amazon  ECR  uses
              server-side encryption with Amazon  S3-managed  encryption  keys
              which encrypts the images in the repository using an AES-256 en-
              cryption algorithm. For more information,  see  Protecting  data
              using  server-side  encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption
              keys (SSE-S3) in the Amazon Simple Storage Service  Console  De-
              veloper Guide .

          kmsKey -> (string)
              If  you  use the KMS encryption type, specify the KMS key to use
              for encryption. The alias, key ID, or full ARN of  the  KMS  key
              can  be  specified. The key must exist in the same Region as the
              repository. If no key is specified, the default Amazon Web  Ser-
              vices managed KMS key for Amazon ECR will be used.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          encryptionType=string,kmsKey=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "encryptionType": "AES256"|"KMS",
            "kmsKey": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       ity

       The following create-repository example creates a repository configured
       for tag immutability in the default registry for an account.

          aws ecr create-repository \
              --repository-name sample-repo \
              --image-tag-mutability IMMUTABLE

       Guide.

       Example 3: To create a repository configured with a scanning configura-
       tion

       The following create-repository example creates a repository configured
       to perform a vulnerability scan on image push in the  default  registry
       for an account.

          aws ecr create-repository \
              --repository-name sample-repo \
              --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true

       Output:

          {
              "repository": {
                  "registryId": "123456789012",

          repositoryArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the repository.
              The ARN contains the arn:aws:ecr namespace, followed by the  re-
              gion  of  the  repository, Amazon Web Services account ID of the
              repository owner, repository namespace, and repository name. For
              example, arn:aws:ecr:region:012345678910:repository/test .

          registryId -> (string)
              The  Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the registry
              that contains the repository.

          repositoryName -> (string)
              The name of the repository.

          repositoryUri -> (string)
              The URI for the repository. You can use this URI  for  container
              image push and pull operations.

          createdAt -> (timestamp)
              The  date  and time, in JavaScript date format, when the reposi-
              tory was created.

              The tag mutability setting for the repository.

          imageScanningConfiguration -> (structure)
              The image scanning configuration for a repository.

              scanOnPush -> (boolean)
                 The setting that determines whether images are scanned  after
                 being pushed to a repository. If set to true , images will be
                 scanned after being pushed. If this parameter is  not  speci-
                 fied, it will default to false and images will not be scanned
                 unless a scan is manually started with the API_StartImageScan
                 API.

          encryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
              The encryption configuration for the repository. This determines
              how the contents of your repository are encrypted at rest.

              encryptionType -> (string)
                 The encryption type to use.

                 If you use the KMS  encryption  type,  the  contents  of  the
                 repository  will  be  encrypted  using server-side encryption
                 with Key Management Service key stored in KMS. When  you  use
                 KMS to encrypt your data, you can either use the default Ama-
                 zon Web Services managed KMS key for Amazon ECR,  or  specify
                 your  own KMS key, which you already created. For more infor-
                 mation, see Protecting data using server-side encryption with
                 an  KMS key stored in Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) in the
                 Amazon Simple Storage Service Console Developer Guide .

                 If you use  the  AES256  encryption  type,  Amazon  ECR  uses
                 server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys
                 which encrypts the images in the repository using an  AES-256
                 encryption  algorithm.  For  more information, see Protecting
                 data using server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed  en-
                 cryption  keys  (SSE-S3) in the Amazon Simple Storage Service
                 Console Developer Guide .

              kmsKey -> (string)
                 If you use the KMS encryption type, specify the  KMS  key  to
                 use for encryption. The alias, key ID, or full ARN of the KMS
                 key can be specified. The key must exist in the  same  Region
                 as the repository. If no key is specified, the default Amazon
                 Web Services managed KMS key for Amazon ECR will be used.
