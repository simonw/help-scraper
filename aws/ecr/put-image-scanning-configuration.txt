       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-image-scanning-configuration
          [--registry-id <value>]
          --repository-name <value>
          --image-scanning-configuration <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the registry that
          contains the repository in which to update the image  scanning  con-
          figuration  setting.  If  you do not specify a registry, the default
          registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository in which to  update  the  image  scanning
          configuration setting.

       --image-scanning-configuration (structure)
          The  image  scanning  configuration for the repository. This setting
          determines whether images are scanned for known vulnerabilities  af-
          ter being pushed to the repository.

          scanOnPush -> (boolean)
              The setting that determines whether images are scanned after be-
              ing pushed to a repository. If set to  true  ,  images  will  be
              scanned  after being pushed. If this parameter is not specified,
              it will default to false and images will not be scanned unless a
              scan is manually started with the API_StartImageScan API.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          scanOnPush=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "scanOnPush": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update the image scanning configuration for a repository

       The following put-image-scanning-configuration example updates the  im-

          aws ecr put-image-scanning-configuration \
              --repository-name sample-repo \
              --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true

       Output:

          {
             "registryId": "012345678910",
             "repositoryName": "sample-repo",
             "imageScanningConfiguration": {
               "scanOnPush": true
             }
          }
