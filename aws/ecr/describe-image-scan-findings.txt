DESCRIBE-IMAGE-SCAN-FINDINGS()                  DESCRIBE-IMAGE-SCAN-FINDINGS()



NAME
       describe-image-scan-findings -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the scan findings for the specified image.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-image-scan-findings  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: imageScanFindings.findings

SYNOPSIS
            describe-image-scan-findings
          [--registry-id <value>]
          --repository-name <value>
          --image-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the registry that
          contains the repository in which to describe the image scan findings
          for. If you do not specify a registry, the default registry  is  as-
          sumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The  repository  for  the image for which to describe the scan find-
          ings.

       --image-id (structure)
          An object with identifying information for an image in an Amazon ECR
          repository.

          imageDigest -> (string)
              The sha256 digest of the image manifest.

          imageTag -> (string)
              The tag used for the image.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          imageDigest=string,imageTag=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "imageDigest": "string",
            "imageTag": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe the scan findings for an image

       The following describe-image-scan-findings example  returns  the  image
       scan  findings  for  an  image  using the image digest in the specified
       repository in the default registry for an account.

              --repository-name sample-repo \
