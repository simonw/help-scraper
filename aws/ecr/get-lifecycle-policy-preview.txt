NAME
       get-lifecycle-policy-preview -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  results of the lifecycle policy preview request for the
       specified repository.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-lifecycle-policy-preview is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: previewResults

SYNOPSIS
            get-lifecycle-policy-preview
          [--registry-id <value>]
          --repository-name <value>
          [--image-ids <value>]
          [--filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the registry that
          contains the repository. If you do not specify a registry,  the  de-
          fault registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository.

       --image-ids (list)
          The list of imageIDs to be included.

          (structure)
              An object with identifying information for an image in an Amazon
              ECR repository.

              imageDigest -> (string)
                 The sha256 digest of the image manifest.

              imageTag -> (string)
                 The tag used for the image.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          imageDigest=string,imageTag=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "imageDigest": "string",
              "imageTag": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --filter (structure)
          An optional parameter that filters results based on image tag status
          and all tags, if tagged.

          tagStatus -> (string)
              The tag status of the image.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          tagStatus=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "tagStatus": "TAGGED"|"UNTAGGED"|"ANY"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve details for a lifecycle policy preview

       The following get-lifecycle-policy-preview example retrieves the result

              --repository-name "project-a/amazon-ecs-sample"

       Output:

          {
              "registryId": "012345678910",
