NAME
       get-resource-metrics -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve Performance Insights metrics for a set of data sources, over a
       time period. You can provide specific dimension groups and  dimensions,
       and provide aggregation and filtering criteria for each group.

       NOTE:
          Each response element returns a maximum of 500 bytes. For larger el-
          ements, such as SQL statements, only the first  500  bytes  are  re-
          turned.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-resource-metrics
          --service-type <value>
          --identifier <value>
          --metric-queries <value>
          --start-time <value>
          --end-time <value>
          [--period-in-seconds <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-type (string)
          The  Amazon  Web Services service for which Performance Insights re-
          turns metrics. The only valid value for ServiceType is RDS .

          Possible values:

          o RDS

          o DOCDB

       --identifier (string)
          An immutable, Amazon Web Services  Region-unique  identifier  for  a
          data  source.  Performance  Insights  gathers metrics from this data
          source.

          To use a DB instance as a data  source,  specify  its  DbiResourceId
          value. For example, specify db-FAIHNTYBKTGAUSUZQYPDS2GW4A .

       --metric-queries (list)
          An  array of one or more queries to perform. Each query must specify
          a Performance Insights metric, and can optionally  specify  aggrega-
          tion and filtering criteria.

          (structure)
              A  single  query to be processed. You must provide the metric to
              query. If no other parameters  are  specified,  Performance  In-
              sights returns all data points for the specified metric. Option-
              ally, you can request that the data points be aggregated by  di-
              mension group (GroupBy ), and return only those data points that
              match your criteria (Filter ).

              Metric -> (string)
                 The name of a Performance Insights metric to be measured.

                 Valid values for Metric are:

                 o db.load.avg - a scaled representation of the number of  ac-
                   tive sessions for the database engine.

                 o db.sampledload.avg  - the raw number of active sessions for
                   the database engine.

                 If the number of active sessions is  less  than  an  internal
                 Performance  Insights  threshold, db.load.avg and db.sampled-
                 load.avg are the same value. If the number of active sessions
                 is  greater than the internal threshold, Performance Insights
                 samples the active sessions,  with  db.load.avg  showing  the
                 scaled values, db.sampledload.avg showing the raw values, and
                 db.sampledload.avg less  than  db.load.avg  .  For  most  use
                 cases, you can query db.load.avg only.

              GroupBy -> (structure)
                 A  specification  for how to aggregate the data points from a
                 query result. You must specify a valid dimension group.  Per-
                 formance  Insights  will  return all of the dimensions within
                 that group, unless you provide the names of  specific  dimen-
                 sions  within  that  group. You can also request that Perfor-
                 mance Insights return a limited number of values for a dimen-
                 sion.

                 Group -> (string)
                     The name of the dimension group. Valid values are:

                     o db.session_type - The type of the current session (only
                       Aurora PostgreSQL and RDS PostgreSQL)

                     o db.sql  -  The SQL that is currently executing (all en-

                     o db.sql_tokenized - The SQL digest (all engines)

                     o db.wait_event - The event for which the database  back-

                 Dimensions -> (list)
                     A  list of specific dimensions from a dimension group. If
                     this parameter is not present, then it signifies that all
                     of  the  dimensions  in  the group were requested, or are
                     present in the response.

                   group.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Metric=string,GroupBy={Group=string,Dimensions=[string,string],Limit=integer},Filter={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Metric": "string",
              "GroupBy": {
                "Group": "string",
                "Dimensions": ["string", ...],
                "Limit": integer
              },
              "Filter": {"string": "string"
                ...}
            }
            ...
          ]

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The date and time specifying the beginning of the requested time se-
          ries data. You can't specify a StartTime that's earlier than 7  days
          ago.  The  value  specified  is  inclusive - data points equal to or
          greater than StartTime will be returned.

          The value for StartTime must be earlier than the value for EndTime .

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The date and time specifying the end of the  requested  time  series
          data.  The value specified is exclusive - data points less than (but
          not equal to) EndTime will be returned.

          The value for EndTime must be later than the value for StartTime .

       --period-in-seconds (integer)
          The granularity, in seconds, of the data points returned  from  Per-
          formance  Insights.  A  period  can be as short as one second, or as
          long as one day (86400 seconds). Valid values are:

          o 1 (one second)

          o 60 (one minute)

          o 300 (five minutes)

          o 3600 (one hour)

          o 86400 (twenty-four hours)

          If you don't specify PeriodInSeconds  ,  then  Performance  Insights
          will  choose  a  value  for  you,  with  a goal of returning roughly
          100-200 data points in the response.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of items to return in the response. If more items
          exist than the specified MaxRecords value, a pagination token is in-
          cluded in the response so that the  remaining  results  can  be  re-
          trieved.

       --next-token (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records  beyond
          the token, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get resource metrics

       This  example  requests  data  points  for  the db.wait_event dimension
       group, and for the db.wait_event.name dimension within that  group.  In
       the response, the relevant data points are grouped by the requested di-
       mension (db.wait_event.name).

       Command:

          aws pi get-resource-metrics --service-type RDS --identifier db-LKCGOBK26374TPTDFXOIWVCPPM --start-time 1527026400 --end-time 1527080400 --period-in-seconds 300 --metric db.load.avg --metric-queries file://metric-queries.json

       The arguments for --metric-queries are stored  in  a  JSON  file,  met-
       ric-queries.json.  Here are the contents of that file:

          [
              {
                  "Metric": "db.load.avg",
                  "GroupBy": {

                  }
              }
          ]

       Output:

OUTPUT
       AlignedStartTime -> (timestamp)
          The start time for the returned metrics, after alignment to a granu-
          lar boundary (as specified by  PeriodInSeconds  ).  AlignedStartTime
          will be less than or equal to the value of the user-specified Start-
          Time .

       AlignedEndTime -> (timestamp)
          The end time for the returned metrics, after alignment to a granular
          boundary  (as specified by PeriodInSeconds ). AlignedEndTime will be
          greater than or equal to the value of the user-specified Endtime .

       Identifier -> (string)
          An immutable, Amazon Web Services  Region-unique  identifier  for  a
          data  source.  Performance  Insights  gathers metrics from this data
          source.

          To use a DB instance as a data source, you specify its DbiResourceId
          value - for example: db-FAIHNTYBKTGAUSUZQYPDS2GW4A

       MetricList -> (list)
          An  array  of metric results,, where each array element contains all
          of the data points for a particular dimension.

          (structure)
              A time-ordered series of data points, corresponding to a  dimen-
              sion of a Performance Insights metric.

              Key -> (structure)
                 The dimensions to which the data points apply.

                 Metric -> (string)
                     The name of a Performance Insights metric to be measured.

                     Valid values for Metric are:

                     o db.load.avg  - a scaled representation of the number of
                       active sessions for the database engine.

                     o db.sampledload.avg - the raw number of active  sessions
                       for the database engine.

                     If the number of active sessions is less than an internal
                     Performance Insights threshold, db.load.avg  and  db.sam-
                     pledload.avg  are the same value. If the number of active

                     mance   Insights   samples   the  active  sessions,  with
                     db.load.avg showing the scaled values, db.sampledload.avg
                     showing  the raw values, and db.sampledload.avg less than
                     db.load.avg  .  For  most  use  cases,  you   can   query
                     db.load.avg only.

                 Dimensions -> (map)
                     The valid dimensions for the metric.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

              DataPoints -> (list)
                 An  array of timestamp-value pairs, representing measurements
                 over a period of time.

                 (structure)
                     A timestamp, and a single numerical value, which together
                     represent a measurement at a particular point in time.

                     Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                        The  time, in epoch format, associated with a particu-
                        lar Value .

                     Value -> (double)
                        The actual value associated with  a  particular  Time-
                        stamp .

       NextToken -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records  beyond
          the token, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .
