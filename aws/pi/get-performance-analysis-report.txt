OPTIONS
       --service-type (string)
          The Amazon Web Services service for which Performance Insights  will
          return metrics. Valid value is RDS .

          Possible values:

          o RDS

          o DOCDB

       --identifier (string)
          An immutable identifier for a data source that is unique for an Ama-
          zon Web Services Region. Performance Insights gathers  metrics  from
          this data source. In the console, the identifier is shown as Resour-
          ceID . When you call DescribeDBInstances ,  the  identifier  is  re-
          turned as DbiResourceId .

          To  use  a  DB  instance as a data source, specify its DbiResourceId
          value. For example, specify db-ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTU1VW2X .

       --analysis-report-id (string)
          A unique identifier of the created analysis report. For example, re-
          port-12345678901234567

       --text-format (string)
          Indicates  the text format in the report. The options are PLAIN_TEXT
          or MARKDOWN . The default value is plain text .

          Possible values:

          o PLAIN_TEXT

          o MARKDOWN

       --accept-language (string)
          The text language in the report. The default language is EN_US (Eng-
          lish).

          Possible values:

          o EN_US

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
