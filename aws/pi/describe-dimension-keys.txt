NAME
       describe-dimension-keys -

DESCRIPTION
       For  a  specific  time  period, retrieve the top N dimension keys for a
       metric.

       NOTE:
          Each response element returns a maximum of 500 bytes. For larger el-
          ements,  such  as  SQL  statements, only the first 500 bytes are re-
          turned.

OPTIONS
       --service-type (string)
          The Amazon Web Services service for which Performance Insights  will
          return metrics. Valid values are as follows:

          o RDS

          o DOCDB

          Possible values:

          o RDS

          o DOCDB

       --identifier (string)
          An  immutable,  Amazon  Web  Services Region-unique identifier for a
          data source. Performance Insights gathers  metrics  from  this  data
          source.

          To  use  an  Amazon  RDS  instance as a data source, you specify its
          DbiResourceId   value.   For   example,    specify    db-FAIHNTYBKT-
          GAUSUZQYPDS2GW4A .

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The date and time specifying the beginning of the requested time se-
          ries data. You must specify a StartTime within the past 7 days.  The
          value specified is inclusive , which means that data points equal to
          or greater than StartTime are returned.

          The value for StartTime must be earlier than the value for EndTime .

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The date and time specifying the end of the  requested  time  series
          data.  The  value  specified  is  exclusive  , which means that data
          points less than (but not equal to) EndTime are returned.

          The value for EndTime must be later than the value for StartTime .

       --metric (string)
          The name of a Performance Insights metric to be measured.

          Valid values for Metric are:

          o db.load.avg - A scaled representation of the number of active ses-
            sions for the database engine.

          o db.sampledload.avg  -  The  raw  number of active sessions for the
            database engine.

          If the number of active sessions is less than  an  internal  Perfor-
          mance Insights threshold, db.load.avg and db.sampledload.avg are the
          same value. If the number of active sessions is greater than the in-
          ternal  threshold, Performance Insights samples the active sessions,
          with db.load.avg showing the scaled values, db.sampledload.avg show-
          ing  the  raw values, and db.sampledload.avg less than db.load.avg .
          For most use cases, you can query db.load.avg only.

       --period-in-seconds (integer)
          The granularity, in seconds, of the data points returned  from  Per-
          formance  Insights.  A  period  can be as short as one second, or as
          long as one day (86400 seconds). Valid values are:

          o 1 (one second)

          o 60 (one minute)

          o 300 (five minutes)

          o 3600 (one hour)

          o 86400 (twenty-four hours)

          If you don't specify PeriodInSeconds  ,  then  Performance  Insights
          chooses  a  value  for you, with a goal of returning roughly 100-200
          data points in the response.

       --group-by (structure)
          A specification for how to aggregate the data points  from  a  query
          result.  You  must  specify a valid dimension group. Performance In-
          sights returns all dimensions within this group, unless you  provide
          the names of specific dimensions within this group. You can also re-
          quest that Performance Insights return a limited  number  of  values
          for a dimension.

          Group -> (string)
              The name of the dimension group. Valid values are as follows:

              o db.sql_tokenized.db_id - Either the native database ID used to
                refer  to  the  SQL  statement,  or  a  synthetic  ID  such as
                pi-2372568224 that Performance Insights generates if  the  na-
                tive  database  ID  isn't available (all engines except Amazon
                DocumentDB).

              (string)
                 A generic string type that forbids characters that could  ex-
                 pose  our  service (or services downstream) to security risks
                 around injections.

          Limit -> (integer)
              The maximum number of items to fetch for this dimension group.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Group=string,Dimensions=string,string,Limit=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Group": "string",
            "Dimensions": ["string", ...],
            "Limit": integer
          }

       --filter (map)
          One or more filters to apply in the request. Restrictions:

          o Any number of filters by the same dimension, as specified  in  the
            GroupBy or Partition parameters.

          o A single filter for any other dimension in this dimension group.

          NOTE:
              The  db.sql.db_id  filter isn't available for RDS for SQL Server
              DB instances.

          key -> (string)
              A generic string type that forbids characters that could  expose
              our  service  (or  services downstream) to security risks around
              injections.

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of items to return in the response. If more items
          exist than the specified MaxRecords value, a pagination token is in-
          cluded in the response so that the  remaining  results  can  be  re-
          trieved.

       --next-token (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records  beyond
          the token, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe dimension keys

       This example requests the names of all wait events. The data is  summa-
       rized  by event name, and the aggregate values of those events over the
       specified time period.

       Command:

          aws pi describe-dimension-keys --service-type RDS --identifier db-LKCGOBK26374TPTDFXOIWVCPPM --start-time 1527026400 --end-time 1527080400 --metric db.load.avg --group-by '{"Group":"db.wait_event"}'

          granular  boundary (as specified by PeriodInSeconds ). AlignedStart-
          Time will be less than or equal to the value of  the  user-specified
          StartTime .

       AlignedEndTime -> (timestamp)
          The  end  time for the returned dimension keys, after alignment to a
          granular boundary (as specified by PeriodInSeconds ). AlignedEndTime

          (structure)
              If PartitionBy was specified in a DescribeDimensionKeys request,
              the dimensions are returned in an array. Each element in the ar-
              ray specifies one dimension.

              Dimensions -> (map)
                 A  dimension map that contains the dimensions for this parti-
                 tion.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       Keys -> (list)
          The dimension keys that were requested.

          (structure)
              An object that includes the requested dimension key  values  and
              aggregated metric values within a dimension group.

              Dimensions -> (map)
                 A map of name-value pairs for the dimensions in the group.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              Total -> (double)
                 The  aggregated metric value for the dimensions, over the re-
                 quested time range.

              AdditionalMetrics -> (map)
                 A map that contains the value for each additional metric.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (double)

              Partitions -> (list)
                 If PartitionBy was specified, PartitionKeys contains the  di-
                 mensions that were.

                 (double)

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  pagination  token  that  indicates  the response didnt return all
          available records because MaxRecords was specified in  the  previous
          request.  To get the remaining records, specify NextToken in a sepa-
          rate request with this value.
