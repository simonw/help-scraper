LIST-RESOURCES()                                              LIST-RESOURCES()



NAME
       list-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  resources  that  you  added to a resource shares or the re-
       sources that are shared with you.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-resources is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: resources

       --principal (string)
          Specifies that you want to list only the resource  shares  that  are
          associated with the specified principal.

       --resource-type (string)
          Specifies  that  you  want to list only the resource shares that in-
          clude resources of the specified resource type.

          For valid values, query the  ListResourceTypes operation.

       --resource-arns (list)

       --resource-share-arns (list)
          Specifies  that  you  want  to  list  only resources in the resource
          shares identified by the specified Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) .

          o ALL

          o REGIONAL

          o GLOBAL

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the resources associated with a resource share

       The following list-resources example lists all resources in the  speci-
       fied resource share that are of the specified resource type.

          aws ram list-resources \
              --resource-type ec2:Subnet \
              --resource-owner SELF \
              --resource-share-arn arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/7ab63972-b505-7e2a-420d-6f5d3EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "resources": [
                  {
                      "arn": "aarn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:subnet/subnet-0250c25a1f4e15235",
                      "type": "ec2:Subnet",
                      "resourceShareArn": "arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/7ab63972-b505-7e2a-420d-6f5d3EXAMPLE",
                      "creationTime": 1565301545.023,
                      "lastUpdatedTime": 1565301545.947
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       resources -> (list)
          An array of objects that contain information about the resources.

          (structure)
              Describes a resource associated with a resource share in RAM.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resoure Name (ARN) of the resource.

              type -> (string)
                 The  resource type. This takes the form of: service-code :re-
                 source-code

              resourceShareArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resoure Name (ARN) of the resource share this  re-
                 source is associated with.

              resourceGroupArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resoure  Name  (ARN) of the resource group. This
                 value is available only if the resource is part of a resource
                 group.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status of the resource.

              statusMessage -> (string)
                 A message about the status of the resource.

              creationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and time when the resource was associated with the
                 resource share.

              lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date an time when the association was last updated.

              resourceRegionScope -> (string)
                 Specifies the scope of visibility of this resource:

                 o REGIONAL  The resource can be accessed only  by  using  re-
                   quests  that target the Amazon Web Services Region in which
                   the resource exists.

                 o GLOBAL  The resource can be accessed from  any  Amazon  Web
                   Services Region.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  present, this value indicates that more output is available than
          is included in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken
          request  parameter  in a subsequent call to the operation to get the
          next part of the output. You should repeat this until the  NextToken
          response  element  comes  back as null . This indicates that this is
          the last page of results.
