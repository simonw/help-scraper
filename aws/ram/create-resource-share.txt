CREATE-RESOURCE-SHARE()                                CREATE-RESOURCE-SHARE()



NAME
       create-resource-share -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a resource share. You can provide a list of the Amazon Resource
       Names (ARNs) for the resources that you want to share, a list of  prin-
       cipals  you  want  to  share the resources with, and the permissions to
       grant those principals.

       NOTE:
          Sharing a resource makes it available for use by principals  outside
          of  the Amazon Web Services account that created the resource. Shar-
          ing doesn't change any permissions or quotas that apply to  the  re-
          source in the account that created it.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Specifies the name of the resource share.

       --resource-arns (list)
          Specifies  a  list of one or more ARNs of the resources to associate
          with the resource share.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --principals (list)
          Specifies a list of one or more principals to associate with the re-
          source share.

          You can include the following values:

          o An Amazon Web Services account ID, for example: 123456789012

          o An  Amazon Resoure Name (ARN) of an organization in Organizations,
            for  example:  organizations::123456789012:organization/o-example-
            orgid

          o An  ARN of an organizational unit (OU) in Organizations, for exam-
            ple:     organizations::123456789012:ou/o-exampleorgid/ou-example-
            rootid-exampleouid123

          o An  ARN  of an IAM role, for example: iam::123456789012:role/role-
            name

          o An ARN of an IAM user, for example: iam::123456789012user/username

          NOTE:
              Not all resource types can be shared with IAM roles  and  users.
              For  more  information,  see Sharing with IAM roles and users in
              the Resource Access Manager User Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          Specifies one or more tags to attach to the resource  share  itself.
          It  doesn't attach the tags to the resources associated with the re-
          source share.

          (structure)
              A structure containing a tag. A tag is metadata that you can at-
              tach to your resources to help organize and categorize them. You
              can also use them to help you secure your  resources.  For  more
              information,  see  Controlling access to Amazon Web Services re-
              sources using tags .

              For more information about tags, see Tagging Amazon Web Services
              resources in the Amazon Web Services General Reference Guide .

              key -> (string)
                 The  key, or name, attached to the tag. Every tag must have a
                 key. Key names are case sensitive.

              value -> (string)
                 The string value attached to the tag. The  value  can  be  an
                 empty string. Key values are case sensitive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --allow-external-principals | --no-allow-external-principals (boolean)
          Specifies  whether principals outside your organization in Organiza-
          tions can be associated with a resource share. A value of true  lets
          you  share with individual Amazon Web Services accounts that are not
          in your organization. A value of false only has meaning if your  ac-
          count  is  a  member of an Amazon Web Services Organization. The de-
          fault value is true .

       --client-token (string)
          Specifies a unique, case-sensitive identifier that  you  provide  to
          ensure  the  idempotency  of the request. This lets you safely retry
          the request without accidentally performing  the  same  operation  a
          second  time. Passing the same value to a later call to an operation
          requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters.
          We recommend that you use a UUID type of value. .

          If  you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates
          a random one for you.

       --permission-arns (list)
          Specifies the Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the RAM permission  to
          associate  with the resource share. If you do not specify an ARN for
          the permission, RAM automatically attaches the  default  version  of
          the  permission  for  each resource type. You can associate only one
          permission with each resource type included in the resource share.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To create a resource share

       The  following  create-resource-share example creates an empty resource
       share with the specified name. You must separately add resources, prin-
       cipals, and permissions to the share.

          aws ram create-resource-share \
              --name MyNewResourceShare

       Output:

          {
              "resourceShare": {
                  "resourceShareArn": "arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/4476c27d-8feb-4b21-afe9-7de23EXAMPLE",
                  "name": "MyNewResourceShare",
                  "owningAccountId": "123456789012",
                  "allowExternalPrincipals": true,
                  "status": "ACTIVE",
                  "creationTime": 1634586271.302,
                  "lastUpdatedTime": 1634586271.302
              }
          }

       Example 2: To create a resource share with AWS accounts as principals

       The  following  create-resource-share  example creates a resource share
       and grants access to the specified AWS account (222222222222).  If  the
       specified  principals  are  not part of the same AWS Organization, then
       invitations are sent and must be accepted before access is granted.

          aws ram create-resource-share \
              --name MyNewResourceShare \
              --principals 222222222222

       Example 3: To create a resource share restricted to your AWS  Organiza-
       tion

       The  following  create-resource-share  example creates a resource share
       that is restricted to accounts in the AWS Organization  that  your  ac-
       count is a member of, and adds the specified OU as a principal. All ac-
       counts in that OU can use the resources in the resource share.

          aws ram create-resource-share \
              --name MyNewResourceShare \
              --no-allow-external-principals \
              --principals arn:aws:organizations::123456789012:ou/o-63bEXAMPLE/ou-46xi-rEXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "resourceShare": {
                  "resourceShareArn": "arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/7be8694e-095c-41ca-9ce8-7be4aEXAMPLE",
                  "name": "MyNewResourceShare",
                  "owningAccountId": "123456789012",
                  "allowExternalPrincipals": false,
                  "status": "ACTIVE",
                  "creationTime": 1634587042.49,
                  "lastUpdatedTime": 1634587042.49
              }
          }

                created from an  Identity  and  Access  Management  (IAM)  re-
                source-based  permission policy attached to the resource. This
                type of resource share is visible only to the Amazon Web  Ser-
                vices  account that created it. You can't modify it in RAM un-
                less you promote it. For  more  information,  see   PromoteRe-
                sourceShareCreatedFromPolicy .

              o PROMOTING_TO_STANDARD  -  The resource share is in the process
                of being promoted. For more information, see  PromoteResource-
                ShareCreatedFromPolicy .

              o STANDARD  -  Indicates  that the resource share was created in
                RAM using the console or APIs. These resource shares are visi-
                ble  to  all principals you share the resource share with. You
                can modify these resource shares in RAM using the  console  or
                APIs.

       clientToken -> (string)
          The idempotency identifier associated with this request. If you want
          to repeat the same operation in an idempotent manner then  you  must
          include  this  value  in  the  clientToken request parameter of that
          later call. All other parameters must also have the same values that
          you used in the first call.
