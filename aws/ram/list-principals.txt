LIST-PRINCIPALS()                                            LIST-PRINCIPALS()



NAME
       list-principals -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  principals  that you are sharing resources with or that are
       sharing resources with you.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-principals is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: principals

          NOTE:
              Not all resource types can be shared with IAM roles  and  users.
              For  more  information,  see Sharing with IAM roles and users in
              the Resource Access Manager User Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --resource-type (string)
          Specifies that you want to list information for only principals  as-
          sociated  with  resource  shares that include the specified resource
          type.

          For a list of valid values, query the  ListResourceTypes operation.

       --resource-share-arns (list)
          Specifies that you want to list information for only principals  as-
          sociated with the resource shares specified by a list the Amazon Re-
          source Names (ARNs) .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list principals with access to a resource

       The following list-principals example displays a list of the principals
       that  can  access  resources of the specified type through any resource
       shares.

          aws ram list-principals \
              --resource-type ec2:Subnet

       Output:

          {
              "principals": [
                  {
                      "id": "arn:aws:organizations::123456789012:ou/o-gx7EXAMPLE/ou-29c5-zEXAMPLE",
                      "resourceShareArn": "arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/7ab63972-b505-7e2a-420d-6f5d3EXAMPLE",
                      "creationTime": 1565298209.737,
                      "lastUpdatedTime": 1565298211.019,
                      "external": false
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       principals -> (list)
          An array of objects that contain the details about the principals.

          (structure)
              Describes a principal for use with Resource Access Manager.

              id -> (string)
                 The ID of the principal.

              resourceShareArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resoure Name (ARN) of a resource share the princi-
                 pal is associated with.

              creationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date and time when the principal was associated with the
                 resource share.

              lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the association was last updated.

              external -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the principal belongs to the same organiza-
                 tion in Organizations as the Amazon Web Services account that
                 owns the resource share.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If present, this value indicates that more output is available  than
          is included in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken
          request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to  get  the
          next  part of the output. You should repeat this until the NextToken
          response element comes back as null . This indicates  that  this  is
          the last page of results.
