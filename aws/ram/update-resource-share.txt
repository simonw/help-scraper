UPDATE-RESOURCE-SHARE()                                UPDATE-RESOURCE-SHARE()



NAME
       update-resource-share -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies some of the properties of the specified resource share.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-resource-share
          --resource-share-arn <value>
          [--name <value>]
          [--allow-external-principals | --no-allow-external-principals]
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-share-arn (string)
          Specifies  the  Amazon Resoure Name (ARN) of the resource share that
          you want to modify.

       --name (string)
          If specified, the new name that you want to attach to  the  resource
          share.

       --allow-external-principals | --no-allow-external-principals (boolean)
          Specifies  whether principals outside your organization in Organiza-
          tions can be associated with a resource share.

       --client-token (string)
          Specifies a unique, case-sensitive identifier that  you  provide  to
          ensure  the  idempotency  of the request. This lets you safely retry
          the request without accidentally performing  the  same  operation  a
          second  time. Passing the same value to a later call to an operation
          requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters.
          We recommend that you use a UUID type of value. .

          If  you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates
          a random one for you.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a resource share

       The  following  update-resource-share example changes the specified re-
       source share to allow external principals that are not in an AWS  Orga-
       nization.

          aws ram update-resource-share \
              --allow-external-principals \
              --resource-share-arn arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/7ab63972-b505-7e2a-420d-6f5d3EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "resourceShare": {
                  "resourceShareArn": "arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/7ab63972-b505-7e2a-420d-6f5d3EXAMPLE",
                  "name": "my-resource-share",
                  "owningAccountId": "123456789012",
                  "allowExternalPrincipals": true,
                  "status": "ACTIVE",
                  "creationTime": 1565295733.282,
                  "lastUpdatedTime": 1565303080.023
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       resourceShare -> (structure)
          Information about the resource share.

          resourceShareArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resoure Name (ARN) of the resource share

          name -> (string)
              The name of the resource share.

          owningAccountId -> (string)
              The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the resource
              share.

          allowExternalPrincipals -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether principals outside your organization in  Orga-
              nizations can be associated with a resource share.

          status -> (string)
              The current status of the resource share.

          statusMessage -> (string)
              A message about the status of the resource share.

          tags -> (list)
              The tag key and value pairs attached to the resource share.

              (structure)
                 A  structure containing a tag. A tag is metadata that you can
                 attach to your resources  to  help  organize  and  categorize
                 them.  You  can  also  use  them  to help you secure your re-
                 sources. For more information, see Controlling access to Ama-
                 zon Web Services resources using tags .

                 For  more information about tags, see Tagging Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices resources in the Amazon Web Services General  Reference
                 Guide .

                 key -> (string)
                     The  key,  or  name,  attached to the tag. Every tag must
                     have a key. Key names are case sensitive.

                 value -> (string)
                     The string value attached to the tag. The value can be an
                     empty string. Key values are case sensitive.

          creationTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the resource share was created.

          lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the resource share was last updated.

          featureSet -> (string)
              Indicates  how  the  resource share was created. Possible values
              include:

              o CREATED_FROM_POLICY - Indicates that the  resource  share  was
                created  from  an  Identity  and  Access  Management (IAM) re-
                source-based permission policy attached to the resource.  This
                type  of resource share is visible only to the Amazon Web Ser-
                vices account that created it. You can't modify it in RAM  un-
                less  you  promote  it.  For more information, see  PromoteRe-
                sourceShareCreatedFromPolicy .

              o PROMOTING_TO_STANDARD - The resource share is in  the  process
                of being promoted. For more information, see  PromoteResource-
                ShareCreatedFromPolicy .

              o STANDARD - Indicates that the resource share  was  created  in
                RAM using the console or APIs. These resource shares are visi-
                ble to all principals you share the resource share  with.  You
                can  modify  these resource shares in RAM using the console or
                APIs.

       clientToken -> (string)
          The idempotency identifier associated with this request. If you want
          to  repeat  the same operation in an idempotent manner then you must
          include this value in the  clientToken  request  parameter  of  that
          later call. All other parameters must also have the same values that
          you used in the first call.
