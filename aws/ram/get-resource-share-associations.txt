GET-RESOURCE-SHARE-ASSOCIATIONS()            GET-RESOURCE-SHARE-ASSOCIATIONS()



NAME
       get-resource-share-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  resource and principal associations for resource shares
       that you own.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-resource-share-associations is a paginated operation. Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: resourceShareAssociations

SYNOPSIS
            get-resource-share-associations
          --association-type <value>
          [--resource-share-arns <value>]
          [--resource-arn <value>]
          [--principal <value>]
          [--association-status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --association-type (string)
          Specifies whether you want to retrieve the associations that involve
          a specified resource or principal.

          o PRINCIPAL  list the principals that are associated with the speci-
            fied resource share.

          o RESOURCE   list  the resources that are associated with the speci-
            fied resource share.

          Possible values:

          o PRINCIPAL

          o RESOURCE

       --resource-share-arns (list)
          Specifies a list of Amazon Resource Names  (ARNs)  of  the  resource
          share whose associations you want to retrieve.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --resource-arn (string)
          Specifies  the  Amazon  Resoure Name (ARN) of the resource whose re-
          source shares you want to retrieve.

          You cannot specify this parameter if the association type is PRINCI-
          PAL .

       --principal (string)
          Specifies  the ID of the principal whose resource shares you want to
          retrieve. This can be an Amazon Web Services account ID, an  organi-
          zation  ID,  an  organizational  unit ID, or the Amazon Resoure Name
          (ARN) of an individual IAM user or role.

          You cannot specify this parameter if the  association  type  is  RE-
          SOURCE .

       --association-status (string)
          Specifies that you want to retrieve only associations with this sta-
          tus.

          Possible values:

          o ASSOCIATING

          o ASSOCIATED

          o FAILED

          o DISASSOCIATING

          o DISASSOCIATED

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To list all resource associations for all resource types

       The following get-resource-share-associations  example  lists  the  re-
       source  associations for all resource types across all of your resource
       shares.

          aws ram get-resource-share-associations \
              --association-type RESOURCE

       Output:

       Example 2: To list principal associations for a resource share

       The following get-resource-share-associations example  lists  only  the
       principal associations for only the specified resource share.

          aws ram get-resource-share-associations \
             --resource-share-arns arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/7be8694e-095c-41ca-9ce8-7be4aEXAMPLE \
             --association-type PRINCIPAL

       Output:

          {
              "resourceShareAssociations": [
                  {
                      "resourceShareArn": "arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/7be8694e-095c-41ca-9ce8-7be4aEXAMPLE",
                      "resourceShareName": "MyNewResourceShare",
                      "associatedEntity": "arn:aws:organizations::123456789012:ou/o-63bEXAMPLE/ou-46xi-rEXAMPLE",
                      "associationType": "PRINCIPAL",

                      "external": false
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       resourceShareAssociations -> (list)
          An array of objects that contain the details about the associations.

          (structure)
              Describes  an  association  with  a  resource share and either a
              principal or a resource.

              resourceShareArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resoure Name (ARN) of the resource share.

              resourceShareName -> (string)
                 The name of the resource share.

              associatedEntity -> (string)
                 The associated entity. This can be either of the following:

                 o For a resource association, this is the Amazon Resoure Name
                   (ARN) of the resource.

                 o For principal associations, this is one of the following:

                   o The ID of an Amazon Web Services account

                   o The Amazon Resoure Name (ARN) of an organization in Orga-
                     nizations

                   o The ARN of an organizational unit (OU) in Organizations

                   o The ARN of an IAM role

                   o The ARN of an IAM user

              associationType -> (string)
                 The type of entity included in this association.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status of the association.

              statusMessage -> (string)
                 A message about the status of the association.

              creationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the association was created.

              lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the association was last updated.

              external -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the principal belongs to the same organiza-
                 tion in Organizations as the Amazon Web Services account that
                 owns the resource share.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If present, this value indicates that more output is available  than
          is included in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken
          request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to  get  the
          next  part of the output. You should repeat this until the NextToken
          response element comes back as null . This indicates  that  this  is
          the last page of results.
