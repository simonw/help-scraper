NAME
       list-permission-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the available versions of the specified RAM permission.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-permission-versions
          --permission-arn <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --permission-arn (string)
          Specifies  the Amazon Resoure Name (ARN) of the RAM permission whose
          versions you want to list. You can use the permissionVersion parame-
          ter  on the  AssociateResourceSharePermission operation to specify a
          non-default version to attach.

       --next-token (string)
          Specifies that you want to receive the next page of  results.  Valid
          only  if  you received a NextToken response in the previous request.
          If you did, it indicates that more output is available. Set this pa-
          rameter  to  the value provided by the previous call's NextToken re-
          sponse to request the next page of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies the total number of results that you want included on each
          page  of  the response. If you do not include this parameter, it de-
          faults to a value that is specific to the operation.  If  additional
          items  exist  beyond  the number you specify, the NextToken response
          element is returned with a value (not null). Include  the  specified
          value as the NextToken request parameter in the next call to the op-
          eration to get the next part of the results. Note that  the  service
          might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more
          results available. You should check NextToken after every  operation
          to ensure that you receive all of the results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       permissions -> (list)
          An array of objects that contain details for each of  the  available
          versions.

          (structure)
              Information  about  an  RAM permission that is associated with a
              resource share and any of its resources of a specified type.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resoure Name (ARN) of the permission you want  in-
                 formation about.

              version -> (string)
                 The version of the permission represented in this structure.

              defaultVersion -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  the version of the permission represented
                 in this structure is the default version for this permission.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of this permission.

              resourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to which this permission applies.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status of the permission.

              creationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the permission was created.

              lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the permission was last updated.

              isResourceTypeDefault -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the version of the  permission  represented
                 in this structure is the default version for all resources of
                 this resource type.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If present, this value indicates that more output is available  than
          is included in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken
          request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to  get  the
          next  part of the output. You should repeat this until the NextToken
          response element comes back as null . This indicates  that  this  is
          the last page of results.
