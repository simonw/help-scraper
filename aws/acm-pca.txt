DESCRIPTION
       This  is  the  ACM Private CA API Reference . It provides descriptions,
       syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data  types  in-
       volved  in  creating  and managing private certificate authorities (CA)
       for your organization.

       The documentation for each action shows the Query API  request  parame-
       ters  and  the  XML response. Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS
       SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the  programming  language  or
       platform that you're using. For more information, see AWS SDKs .

       Each  ACM Private CA API operation has a quota that determines the num-
       ber of times the operation can be called per  second.  ACM  Private  CA
       throttles  API  requests at different rates depending on the operation.
       Throttling means that ACM Private CA rejects an otherwise valid request
       because the request exceeds the operation's quota for the number of re-
       quests per second. When a request is throttled, ACM Private CA  returns
       a  ThrottlingException error. ACM Private CA does not guarantee a mini-
       mum request rate for APIs.

       To see an up-to-date list of your ACM Private CA quotas, or to  request
       a  quota increase, log into your AWS account and visit the Service Quo-
       tas console.
