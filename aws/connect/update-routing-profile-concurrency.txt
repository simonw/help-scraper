OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)

          (structure)
              Contains information about which channels are supported, and how
              many contacts an agent can have on a channel simultaneously.

              Channel -> (string)
                 The  channels  that  agents can handle in the Contact Control
                 Panel (CCP).

              Concurrency -> (integer)
                 The number of contacts an agent can have on a channel  simul-
                 taneously.

                 Valid  Range for VOICE : Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of
                 1.

                 Valid Range for CHAT : Minimum value of 1. Maximum  value  of
                 10.

                 10.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Channel=string,Concurrency=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Channel": "VOICE"|"CHAT"|"TASK",
              "Concurrency": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
