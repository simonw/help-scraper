STOP-CONTACT-RECORDING()                              STOP-CONTACT-RECORDING()



NAME
       stop-contact-recording -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops  recording  a  call when a contact is being recorded. StopContac-
       tRecording is a one-time action. If  you  use  StopContactRecording  to
       stop  recording an ongoing call, you can't use StartContactRecording to
       restart it. For scenarios where the recording has started and you  want
       to  suspend  it  for  sensitive  information (for example, to collect a
       credit card number), and then restart it,  use  SuspendContactRecording
       and ResumeContactRecording.

       Only voice recordings are supported at this time.

SYNOPSIS
            stop-contact-recording
          --instance-id <value>
          --contact-id <value>
          --initial-contact-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The  identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can find the in-
          stanceId in the ARN of the instance.

       --contact-id (string)
          The identifier of the contact.

       --initial-contact-id (string)
          The identifier of the contact. This is the identifier of the contact
          associated with the first interaction with the contact center.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
