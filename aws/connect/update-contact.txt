              A link that an agent selects to complete a given task.  You  can
              have  up  to  4,096 UTF-8 bytes across all references for a con-
              tact.

              Value -> (string)
                 A valid value for the reference. For example, for a URL  ref-
                 erence,  a formatted URL that is displayed to an agent in the

                 dated on a contact.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=Value=string,Type=string,KeyName2=Value=string,Type=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {
                "Value": "string",
                "Type": "URL"|"ATTACHMENT"
              }
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
