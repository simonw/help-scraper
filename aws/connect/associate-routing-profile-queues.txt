OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)

          (structure)
              Contains information about the queue and channel for which  pri-
              ority and delay can be set.

              QueueReference -> (structure)
                 Contains information about a queue resource.

                 QueueId -> (string)
                     The identifier for the queue.

                     The  channels  agents  can  handle in the Contact Control

              Delay -> (integer)
                 The  delay,  in seconds, a contact should be in the queue be-
                 fore they are routed to an available agent. For more informa-

                 Administrator Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          QueueReference={QueueId=string,Channel=string},Priority=integer,Delay=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "QueueReference": {
                "QueueId": "string",
                "Channel": "VOICE"|"CHAT"|"TASK"
              },
              "Priority": integer,
              "Delay": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
