CREATE-INSTANCE()                                            CREATE-INSTANCE()



NAME
       create-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       This  API  is  in  preview release for Amazon Connect and is subject to
       change.

       Initiates an Amazon Connect instance with all  the  supported  channels
       enabled.  It does not attach any storage, such as Amazon Simple Storage
       Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon Kinesis. It also does not allow  for  any
       configurations on features, such as Contact Lens for Amazon Connect.

       Amazon  Connect  enforces a limit on the total number of instances that
       you can create or delete in 30 days. If you exceed this limit, you will
       get  an  error message indicating there has been an excessive number of
       attempts at creating or deleting instances. You must wait 30  days  be-
       fore you can restart creating and deleting instances in your account.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-instance
          [--client-token <value>]
          --identity-management-type <value>
          [--instance-alias <value>]
          [--directory-id <value>]
          --inbound-calls-enabled | --no-inbound-calls-enabled
          --outbound-calls-enabled | --no-outbound-calls-enabled
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          The idempotency token.

       --identity-management-type (string)
          The type of identity management for your Amazon Connect users.

          Possible values:

          o SAML

          o CONNECT_MANAGED

          o EXISTING_DIRECTORY

       --instance-alias (string)
          The name for your instance.

       --directory-id (string)
          The identifier for the directory.

       --inbound-calls-enabled | --no-inbound-calls-enabled (boolean)
          Your contact center handles incoming contacts.

       --outbound-calls-enabled | --no-outbound-calls-enabled (boolean)
          Your contact center allows outbound calls.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Id -> (string)
          The identifier for the instance.

       Arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance.
