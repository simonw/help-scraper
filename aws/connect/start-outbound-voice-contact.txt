START-OUTBOUND-VOICE-CONTACT()                  START-OUTBOUND-VOICE-CONTACT()



NAME
       start-outbound-voice-contact -

DESCRIPTION
       Places  an  outbound  call to a contact, and then initiates the contact
       flow. It performs the actions in the contact flow that's specified  (in
       ContactFlowId ).

       Agents  do  not initiate the outbound API, which means that they do not
       dial the contact. If the contact flow places an outbound call to a con-
       tact,  and  then  puts the contact in queue, the call is then routed to
       the agent, like any other inbound case.

       There is a 60-second dialing timeout for this operation. If the call is
       not connected after 60 seconds, it fails.

       NOTE:
          UK  numbers with a 447 prefix are not allowed by default. Before you
          can dial these UK mobile numbers, you must submit  a  service  quota
          increase  request.  For more information, see Amazon Connect Service
          Quotas in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide .

       NOTE:
          Campaign calls are not allowed by default. Before  you  can  make  a
          call  with  TrafficType = CAMPAIGN , you must submit a service quota
          increase request. For more information, see Amazon  Connect  Service
          Quotas in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide .

OPTIONS
       --destination-phone-number (string)
          The phone number of the customer, in E.164 format.

       --contact-flow-id (string)
          The identifier of the contact flow for the outbound call. To see the
          ContactFlowId in the Amazon Connect console user interface,  on  the
          navigation  menu  go to Routing , Contact Flows . Choose the contact
          flow. On the contact flow page, under the name of the contact  flow,
          choose  Show  additional flow information . The ContactFlowId is the
          last part of the ARN, shown here in bold:

          arn:aws:connect:us-west-2:xxxxxxxxxxxx:in-
          stance/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/con-
          tact-flow/846ec553-a005-41c0-8341-xxxxxxxxxxxx

       --instance-id (string)
          The identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can find the  in-
          stanceId in the ARN of the instance.

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. The token is valid for 7 days after cre-
          ation. If a contact is already started, the contact ID is returned.

       --source-phone-number (string)
          The  phone  number  associated  with the Amazon Connect instance, in
          E.164 format. If you do not specify a source phone number, you  must
          specify a queue.

       --queue-id (string)
          The  queue for the call. If you specify a queue, the phone displayed
          for caller ID is the phone number specified in the queue. If you  do
          not  specify a queue, the queue defined in the contact flow is used.
          If you do not specify a queue, you must specify a source phone  num-
          ber.

       --attributes (map)
          A  custom  key-value pair using an attribute map. The attributes are
          standard Amazon Connect attributes, and can be accessed  in  contact
          flows just like any other contact attributes.

          There can be up to 32,768 UTF-8 bytes across all key-value pairs per
          contact. Attribute keys can include only alphanumeric, dash, and un-
          derscore characters.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --answer-machine-detection-config (structure)
          Configuration  of  the answering machine detection for this outbound
          call.

          EnableAnswerMachineDetection -> (boolean)
              The flag to indicate if answer machine detection analysis  needs
              to  be  performed for a voice call. If set to true , TrafficType
              must be set as CAMPAIGN .

          AwaitAnswerMachinePrompt -> (boolean)
              Wait for the answering machine prompt.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EnableAnswerMachineDetection=boolean,AwaitAnswerMachinePrompt=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "EnableAnswerMachineDetection": true|false,
            "AwaitAnswerMachinePrompt": true|false
          }

       --campaign-id (string)
          The campaign identifier of the outbound communication.

       --traffic-type (string)
          Denotes the class of traffic. Calls with different traffic types are
          handled  differently by Amazon Connect. The default value is GENERAL
          . Use CAMPAIGN if EnableAnswerMachineDetection is set to true .  For
          all other cases, use GENERAL .

          Possible values:

          o GENERAL

          o CAMPAIGN

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ContactId -> (string)
          The identifier of this contact within the Amazon Connect instance.
