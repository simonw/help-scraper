       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-current-metric-data
          --instance-id <value>
          --filters <value>
          [--groupings <value>]
          --current-metrics <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The  identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can find the in-
          stanceId in the ARN of the instance.

       --filters (structure)
          The queues, up to 100, or channels, to use to filter the metrics re-
          turned.  Metric  data is retrieved only for the resources associated
          with the queues or channels included in the filter. You can  include
          both  queue IDs and queue ARNs in the same request. VOICE, CHAT, and
          TASK channels are supported.

          Queues -> (list)
              The queues to use to filter the metrics. You should  specify  at
              least  one  queue, and can specify up to 100 queues per request.
              The GetCurrentMetricsData API in  particular  requires  a  queue
              when you include a Filter in your request.

              (string)

          Channels -> (list)
              The channel to use to filter the metrics.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Queues=string,string,Channels=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Queues": ["string", ...],
            "Channels": ["VOICE"|"CHAT"|"TASK", ...]
          }

       --groupings (list)
          The  grouping  applied  to  the  metrics returned. For example, when
          grouped by QUEUE , the metrics returned apply to each  queue  rather
          than aggregated for all queues. If you group by CHANNEL , you should
          include a Channels filter. VOICE, CHAT, and TASK channels  are  sup-
          ported.

          If  no  Grouping is included in the request, a summary of metrics is
          returned.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            QUEUE
            CHANNEL

       --current-metrics (list)
          The metrics to retrieve. Specify the name and unit for each  metric.
          The  following  metrics  are available. For a description of all the
          metrics, see Real-time Metrics Definitions in the Amazon Connect Ad-
          ministrator Guide .

              CONTACTS_IN_QUEUE

          Unit: COUNT

          Name in real-time metrics report: In queue

              OLDEST_CONTACT_AGE

          Unit: SECONDS

          When  you use groupings, Unit says SECONDS and the Value is returned
          in SECONDS.

          When you do not use groupings, Unit says SECONDS but  the  Value  is
          returned  in  MILLISECONDS.  For example, if you get a response like
          this:
              { "Metric": { "Name": "OLDEST_CONTACT_AGE", "Unit": "SECONDS" },
              "Value": 24113.0 }

          The actual OLDEST_CONTACT_AGE is 24 seconds.

          Name in real-time metrics report: Oldest

              (structure)

              Contains information about a real-time metric. For a description
              of each metric, see Real-time Metrics Definitions in the  Amazon
              Connect Administrator Guide .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the metric.

              Unit -> (string)
                 The unit for the metric.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Unit=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "AGENTS_ONLINE"|"AGENTS_AVAILABLE"|"AGENTS_ON_CALL"|"AGENTS_NON_PRODUCTIVE"|"AGENTS_AFTER_CONTACT_WORK"|"AGENTS_ERROR"|"AGENTS_STAFFED"|"CONTACTS_IN_QUEUE"|"OLDEST_CONTACT_AGE"|"CONTACTS_SCHEDULED"|"AGENTS_ON_CONTACT"|"SLOTS_ACTIVE"|"SLOTS_AVAILABLE",
              "Unit": "SECONDS"|"COUNT"|"PERCENT"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of results. Use the value returned in the
          previous response in the next request to retrieve the  next  set  of
          results.

          The  token expires after 5 minutes from the time it is created. Sub-
          sequent requests that use the token must use the same request param-
          eters as the request that generated the token.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return per page.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If  there are additional results, this is the token for the next set
          of results.

          The token expires after 5 minutes from the time it is created.  Sub-
          sequent requests that use the token must use the same request param-
          eters as the request that generated the token.
