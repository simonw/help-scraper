GET-METRIC-DATA()                                            GET-METRIC-DATA()



NAME
       get-metric-data -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets historical metric data from the specified Amazon Connect instance.

       For  a  description  of  each historical metric, see Historical Metrics
       Definitions in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-metric-data is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: MetricResults

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The  identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can find the in-
          stance ID in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The timestamp, in UNIX Epoch time format, at which to start the  re-
          porting  interval  for the retrieval of historical metrics data. The
          time must be specified using a multiple of 5 minutes, such as 10:05,
          10:10, 10:15.

          The  start  time  cannot be earlier than 24 hours before the time of
          the request. Historical metrics are available only for 24 hours.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The timestamp, in UNIX Epoch time format, at which to  end  the  re-
          porting  interval  for the retrieval of historical metrics data. The
          time must be specified using an  interval  of  5  minutes,  such  as
          11:00,  11:05,  11:10,  and  must be later than the start time time-
          stamp.

          The time range between the start and end time must be less  than  24
          hours.

       --filters (structure)
          The queues, up to 100, or channels, to use to filter the metrics re-
          turned. Metric data is retrieved only for the  resources  associated
          with  the queues or channels included in the filter. You can include
          both queue IDs and queue ARNs in the same request. VOICE, CHAT,  and
          TASK channels are supported.

          NOTE:
              To  filter  by  Queues , enter the queue ID/ARN, not the name of
              the queue.

          Queues -> (list)
              The queues to use to filter the metrics. You should  specify  at
              least  one  queue, and can specify up to 100 queues per request.
              The GetCurrentMetricsData API in  particular  requires  a  queue
              when you include a Filter in your request.

              (string)

          Channels -> (list)
              The channel to use to filter the metrics.

              (string)

          RoutingProfiles -> (list)
              A list of up to 100 routing profile IDs or ARNs.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Queues=string,string,Channels=string,string,RoutingProfiles=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Queues": ["string", ...],
            "Channels": ["VOICE"|"CHAT"|"TASK", ...],
            "RoutingProfiles": ["string", ...]
          }

       --groupings (list)
          The  grouping applied to the metrics returned. For example, when re-
          sults are grouped by queue, the  metrics  returned  are  grouped  by
          queue.  The  values  returned  apply  to  the metrics for each queue
          rather than aggregated for all queues.

          If no grouping is specified, a summary of metrics for all queues  is
          returned.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            QUEUE
            CHANNEL
            ROUTING_PROFILE

       --historical-metrics (list)
          The  metrics  to retrieve. Specify the name, unit, and statistic for
          each metric. The following historical metrics are available.  For  a
          description  of  each  metric, see Historical Metrics Definitions in
          the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide .

          NOTE:
              This API does not support a contacts incoming metric (there's no
              CONTACTS_INCOMING metric missing from the documented list).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If  there are additional results, this is the token for the next set
          of results.

          The token expires after 5 minutes from the time it is created.  Sub-
          sequent requests that use the token must use the same request param-
          eters as the request that generated the token.

       MetricResults -> (list)
