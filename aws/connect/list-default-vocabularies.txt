LIST-DEFAULT-VOCABULARIES()                        LIST-DEFAULT-VOCABULARIES()



NAME
       list-default-vocabularies -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  default  vocabularies  for the specified Amazon Connect in-
       stance.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-default-vocabularies is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: DefaultVocabularyList

SYNOPSIS
            list-default-vocabularies
          --instance-id <value>
          [--language-code <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The  identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can find the in-
          stanceId in the ARN of the instance.

       --language-code (string)
          The language code of the vocabulary entries. For a list of languages
          and  their  corresponding  language  codes, see What is Amazon Tran-
          scribe?

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 The  language  code  of the vocabulary entries. For a list of
                 languages and their corresponding language codes, see What is
                 Amazon Transcribe?

              VocabularyId -> (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  there are additional results, this is the token for the next set
          of results.
