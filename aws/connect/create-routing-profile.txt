OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The  identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can find the in-
          stanceId in the ARN of the instance.

       --name (string)

       --queue-configs (list)
          The inbound queues associated with the routing profile. If no  queue

          (structure)
              Contains  information about the queue and channel for which pri-
              ority and delay can be set.

              QueueReference -> (structure)
                 Contains information about a queue resource.

                 QueueId -> (string)
                     The identifier for the queue.

                 Channel -> (string)
                     The channels agents can handle  in  the  Contact  Control
                     Panel (CCP) for this routing profile.

              Priority -> (integer)
                 The  order in which contacts are to be handled for the queue.
                 For more information, see Queues: priority and delay .

              Delay -> (integer)
                 The delay, in seconds, a contact should be in the  queue  be-
                 fore they are routed to an available agent. For more informa-
                 tion, see Queues: priority and delay in  the  Amazon  Connect
                 Administrator Guide .

          [
            {
              "QueueReference": {
                "QueueId": "string",

       --media-concurrencies (list)
          The  channels  that  agents  can handle in the Contact Control Panel
          (CCP) for this routing profile.

          (structure)
              Contains information about which channels are supported, and how
              many contacts an agent can have on a channel simultaneously.

              Channel -> (string)
                 The  channels  that  agents can handle in the Contact Control
                 Panel (CCP).

              Concurrency -> (integer)
                 The number of contacts an agent can have on a channel  simul-
                 taneously.

                 Valid  Range for VOICE : Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of

                 Valid Range for CHAT : Minimum value of 1. Maximum  value  of
                 10.

                 Valid  Range  for TASK : Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of
                 10.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Channel=string,Concurrency=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Channel": "VOICE"|"CHAT"|"TASK",
              "Concurrency": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --tags (map)
          One or more tags.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RoutingProfileArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the routing profile.

       RoutingProfileId -> (string)
          The identifier of the routing profile.
