START-TASK-CONTACT()                                      START-TASK-CONTACT()



NAME
       start-task-contact -

DESCRIPTION
       Initiates  a  flow  to  start  a new task contact. For more information
       about task contacts, see Concepts: Tasks in Amazon Connect in the  Ama-
       zon Connect Administrator Guide .

       When  using  PreviousContactId  and  RelatedContactId input parameters,
       note the following:

       o PreviousContactId

         o Any updates to user-defined task contact attributes on any  contact
           linked through the same PreviousContactId will affect every contact
           in the chain.

         o There can be a maximum of 12 linked task contacts in a chain.  That
           is,  12  task contacts can be created that share the same Previous-
           ContactId .

       o RelatedContactId

         o Copies contact attributes from the related task contact to the  new
           contact.

         o Any  update on attributes in a new task contact does not update at-
           tributes on previous contact.

         o Theres no limit on the number of task contacts that can be  created
           that use the same RelatedContactId .

       In  addition,  when  calling StartTaskContact include only one of these
       parameters: ContactFlowID , QuickConnectID , or TaskTemplateID  .  Only
       one  parameter is required as long as the task template has a flow con-
       figured to run it. If more than one parameter is specified, or only the
       TaskTemplateID is specified but it does not have a flow configured, the
       request returns an error because Amazon  Connect  cannot  identify  the
       unique flow to run when the task is created.

       A  ServiceQuotaExceededException  occurs  when the number of open tasks
       exceeds the active tasks quota or there are already 12 tasks  referenc-
       ing  the  same  PreviousContactId  . For more information about service
       quotas for task contacts, see Amazon Connect service quotas in the Ama-
       zon Connect Administrator Guide .

          stance ID in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance.

       --previous-contact-id (string)
          The identifier of the previous chat, voice, or task contact. Any up-
          dates  to  user-defined attributes to task contacts linked using the
          same PreviousContactID will affect every contact in the chain. There
          can be a maximum of 12 linked task contacts in a chain.

       --contact-flow-id (string)
          The identifier of the flow for initiating the tasks. To see the Con-
          tactFlowId in the Amazon Connect admin website,  on  the  navigation
          menu  go to Routing , Flows . Choose the flow. On the flow page, un-
          der the name of the flow, choose Show additional flow information  .
          The ContactFlowId is the last part of the ARN, shown here in bold:

          arn:aws:connect:us-west-2:xxxxxxxxxxxx:in-
          stance/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/con-

          KeyName1=Value=string,Type=string,Status=string,Arn=string,StatusReason=string,KeyName2=Value=string,Type=string,Status=string,Arn=string,StatusReason=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {
                "Value": "string",
                "Type": "URL"|"ATTACHMENT"|"CONTACT_ANALYSIS"|"NUMBER"|"STRING"|"DATE"|"EMAIL"|"EMAIL_MESSAGE",

          Control Panel (CCP).

       --client-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request. If not provided, the Amazon Web Services
          SDK populates this field. For more  information  about  idempotency,
          see Making retries safe with idempotent APIs .

       --scheduled-time (timestamp)
          The  timestamp, in Unix Epoch seconds format, at which to start run-
          ning the inbound flow. The scheduled time cannot be in the past.  It
          must be within up to 6 days in future.

       --task-template-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for  the  task template. For more information
          about task templates, see Create task templates in the  Amazon  Con-
          nect Administrator Guide .

       --quick-connect-id (string)
          The  identifier for the quick connect. Tasks that are created by us-
          ing QuickConnectId will use the flow that is  defined  on  agent  or
          queue  quick connect. For more information about quick connects, see
          Create quick connects .

       --related-contact-id (string)
          The contactId that is related to this  contact.  Linking  tasks  to-
          gether by using RelatedContactID copies over contact attributes from
          the related task contact to the new task  contact.  All  updates  to
          user-defined  attributes  in the new task contact are limited to the
          individual contact ID, unlike what happens when tasks are linked  by
          using  PreviousContactID . There are no limits to the number of con-
          tacts that can be linked by using RelatedContactId .

       --segment-attributes (map)
          A set of system defined key-value pairs stored on individual contact
          segments  (unique contact ID) using an attribute map. The attributes
          are standard Amazon Connect attributes.  They  can  be  accessed  in
          flows.

          Attribute keys can include only alphanumeric, -, and _.

          This  field  can be used to set Contact Expiry as a duration in min-
          utes and set a UserId for the User who created a task.

          NOTE:
              To set contact expiry, a ValueMap must be  specified  containing
              the integer number of minutes the contact will be active for be-
              fore expiring, with SegmentAttributes like { "connect:ContactEx-
              piry":  {"ValueMap"  :  {  "ExpiryDuration":  {  "ValueInteger":
              135}}}} .

              To set the created by user, a valid AgentResourceId must be sup-
              plied,  with  SegmentAttributes like { "connect:CreatedByUser" {
              "ValueString":       "arn:aws:connect:us-west-2:xxxxxxxxxxxx:in-
              stance/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/agent/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"}}}
              .

       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
