OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)

          tact  flow.  On the contact flow page, under the name of the contact

          flows just like any other contact attributes.

          There can be up to 32,768 UTF-8 bytes across all key-value pairs per
          contact. Attribute keys can include only alphanumeric, dash, and un-
          derscore characters.

              tact.

              Value -> (string)
                 A  valid value for the reference. For example, for a URL ref-

                 dated on a contact.

          KeyName1=Value=string,Type=string,KeyName2=Value=string,Type=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {
                "Value": "string",
                "Type": "URL"|"ATTACHMENT"
              }
            ...}

       --description (string)
          A description of the task that is shown to an agent in  the  Contact
          Control Panel (CCP).

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request.

       --scheduled-time (timestamp)
          The timestamp, in Unix Epoch seconds format, at which to start  run-
          ning  the  inbound contact flow. The scheduled time cannot be in the
          past. It must be within up to 6 days in future.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ContactId -> (string)
          The identifier of this contact within the Amazon Connect instance.
