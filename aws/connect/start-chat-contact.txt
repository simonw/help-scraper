START-CHAT-CONTACT()                                      START-CHAT-CONTACT()



NAME
       start-chat-contact -

DESCRIPTION
       Initiates a contact flow to start a new chat for the customer. Response
       of this API provides a token required to obtain  credentials  from  the
       CreateParticipantConnection  API in the Amazon Connect Participant Ser-
       vice.

       When a new chat contact is successfully created, clients must subscribe
       to  the  participants connection for the created chat within 5 minutes.
       This is achieved by invoking CreateParticipantConnection with WEBSOCKET
       and CONNECTION_CREDENTIALS.

       A 429 error occurs in the following situations:

       o API  rate  limit is exceeded. API TPS throttling returns a TooManyRe-
         quests exception.

       o The quota for concurrent active chats is exceeded. Active chat throt-
         tling returns a LimitExceededException .

       If you use the ChatDurationInMinutes parameter and receive a 400 error,
       your account may not support the ability to configure custom chat dura-
       tions. For more information, contact Amazon Web Services Support.

       For  more information about chat, see Chat in the Amazon Connect Admin-
       istrator Guide .

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)

          tact flow. On the contact flow page, under the name of  the  contact

       --attributes (map)
          A custom key-value pair using an attribute map. The  attributes  are
          standard  Amazon Connect attributes. They can be accessed in contact
          flows just like any other contact attributes.

          There can be up to 32,768 UTF-8 bytes across all key-value pairs per
          contact. Attribute keys can include only alphanumeric, dash, and un-
          derscore characters.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --participant-details (structure)
          Information identifying the participant.

          DisplayName -> (string)
              Display name of the participant.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DisplayName=string

       JSON Syntax:

            "DisplayName": "string"
          }

       --initial-message (structure)
          The initial message to be sent to the newly created chat.

          ContentType -> (string)
              The type of the content. Supported types are text and plain.

          Content -> (string)
              The content of the chat message.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ContentType=string,Content=string

          {
            "ContentType": "string",
            "Content": "string"
          }

       --client-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request.

       --chat-duration-in-minutes (integer)
          The  total duration of the newly started chat session. If not speci-
          fied, the chat session duration defaults to  25  hour.  The  minumum
          configurable  time  is  60 minutes. The maximum configurable time is
          10,080 minutes (7 days).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          participant is the same throughout the chat lifecycle.

       ParticipantToken -> (string)
          The   token   used    by    the    chat    participant    to    call
          CreateParticipantConnection . The participant token is valid for the
          lifetime of a chat participant.
