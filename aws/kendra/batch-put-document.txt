BATCH-PUT-DOCUMENT()                                      BATCH-PUT-DOCUMENT()



NAME
       batch-put-document -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds one or more documents to an index.

       The  BatchPutDocument  operation enables you to ingest inline documents
       or a set of documents stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use this operation
       to ingest your text and unstructured text into an index, add custom at-
       tributes to the documents, and to attach an access control list to  the
       documents added to the index.

       The  documents  are indexed asynchronously. You can see the progress of
       the batch using Amazon Web Services CloudWatch. Any error messages  re-
       lated  to  processing  the  batch  are sent to your Amazon Web Services
       CloudWatch log.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-put-document
          --index-id <value>
          [--role-arn <value>]
          --documents <value>
          [--custom-document-enrichment-configuration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index to add the documents  to.  You  need  to
          create the index first using the CreateIndex operation.

       --role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a role that is allowed to run the
          BatchPutDocument operation. For more information, see IAM Roles  for
          Amazon Kendra .

       --documents (list)
          One or more documents to add to the index.

          Documents can include custom attributes. For example, 'DataSourceId'
          and 'DataSourceSyncJobId' are custom attributes that provide  infor-
          mation on the synchronization of documents running on a data source.
          Note, 'DataSourceSyncJobId' could be an optional custom attribute as
          Amazon Kendra will use the ID of a running sync job.

          Documents have the following file size limits.

          o 5 MB total size for inline documents

          o 50 MB total size for files from an S3 bucket

          o 5 MB extracted text for any file

          For more information about file size and transaction per second quo-
          tas, see Quotas .

          (structure)
              A document in an index.

              Id -> (string)
                 A unique identifier of the document in the index.

              Title -> (string)
                 The title of the document.

              Blob -> (blob)
                 The contents of the document.

                 Documents passed to the Blob parameter  must  be  base64  en-
                 coded.  Your  code might not need to encode the document file
                 bytes if you're using an Amazon Web Services SDK to call Ama-
                 zon  Kendra  operations. If you are calling the Amazon Kendra
                 endpoint directly using REST, you must base64 encode the con-
                 tents before sending.

              S3Path -> (structure)
                 Information  required to find a specific file in an Amazon S3
                 bucket.

                 Bucket -> (string)
                     The name of the S3 bucket that contains the file.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The name of the file.

              Attributes -> (list)
                 Custom attributes to apply to the document.  Use  the  custom
                 attributes  to  provide additional information for searching,
                 to provide facets for refining searches, and to provide addi-
                 tional information in the query response.

                 (structure)
                     A custom attribute value assigned to a document.

                     For more information on how to create custom document at-
                     tributes, see Custom Attributes .

       --custom-document-enrichment-configuration (structure)
          Configuration  information  for  altering your document metadata and
          content during the document  ingestion  process  when  you  use  the
          BatchPutDocument operation.

          For  more  information  on how to create, modify and delete document
          metadata, or make other content alterations when  you  ingest  docu-
          ments  into  Amazon Kendra, see Customizing document metadata during
          the ingestion process .

          InlineConfigurations -> (list)
              Configuration information to alter document attributes or  meta-
              data  fields  and  content  when ingesting documents into Amazon
              Kendra.

              (structure)
                 Provides the configuration  information  for  applying  basic
                 logic  to  alter document metadata and content when ingesting
                 documents into Amazon Kendra. To apply advanced logic, to  go
                 beyond    what   you   can   do   with   basic   logic,   see
                 HookConfiguration .

                 For more information, see Customizing document metadata  dur-
                 ing the ingestion process .

                 Condition -> (structure)
                     Configuration  of the condition used for the target docu-
                     ment attribute or metadata field when ingesting documents
                     into Amazon Kendra.

                     ConditionDocumentAttributeKey -> (string)
                        The  identifier of the document attribute used for the
                        condition.

                        For example, 'Source_URI' could be an  identifier  for
                        the  attribute  or metadata field that contains source
                        URIs associated with the documents.

                        Amazon  Kendra  currently  does  not  support   _docu-
                        ment_body as an attribute key used for the condition.

                     Operator -> (string)
                        The condition operator.

                        For example, you can use 'Contains' to partially match
                        a string.

                     ConditionOnValue -> (structure)
                        The value used by the operator.

                        For example, you can specify the value 'financial' for
                        strings in the 'Source_URI' field that partially match
                        or contain this value.

                        StringValue -> (string)
                            A string, such as "department".

                        StringListValue -> (list)
                            A list of strings.

                            (string)

                        LongValue -> (long)
                            A long integer value.

                        DateValue -> (timestamp)
                            A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                            It is important for the time zone to  be  included
                            in  the  ISO  8601  date-time format. For example,
                            2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00   is   the   ISO    8601
                            date-time  format  for  March 25th 2012 at 12:30PM
                            (plus 10 seconds) in Central European Time.

                 Target -> (structure)
                     Configuration of the target document attribute  or  meta-
                     data  field  when ingesting documents into Amazon Kendra.
                     You can also include a value.

                     TargetDocumentAttributeKey -> (string)
                        The identifier of the  target  document  attribute  or
                        metadata field.

                        For  example,  'Department' could be an identifier for
                        the target attribute or metadata field  that  includes
                        the department names associated with the documents.

                     TargetDocumentAttributeValueDeletion -> (boolean)
                        TRUE  to  delete  the  existing  target value for your
                        specified target attribute key. You  cannot  create  a
                        target value and set this to TRUE . To create a target
                        value (TargetDocumentAttributeValue  ),  set  this  to
                        FALSE .

                     TargetDocumentAttributeValue -> (structure)
                        The target value you want to create for the target at-
                        tribute.

                        For example, 'Finance' could be the target  value  for
                        the target attribute key 'Department'.

                        StringValue -> (string)
                            A string, such as "department".

                        StringListValue -> (list)
                            A list of strings.

                            (string)

                            A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                            It  is  important for the time zone to be included
                            in the ISO 8601  date-time  format.  For  example,
                            2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00    is   the   ISO   8601
                            date-time format for March 25th  2012  at  12:30PM
                            (plus 10 seconds) in Central European Time.

                 DocumentContentDeletion -> (boolean)
                     TRUE to delete content if the condition used for the tar-
                     get attribute is met.

          PreExtractionHookConfiguration -> (structure)
              Configuration information for  invoking  a  Lambda  function  in
              Lambda  on the original or raw documents before extracting their
              metadata and text. You can use a Lambda function  to  apply  ad-
              vanced logic for creating, modifying, or deleting document meta-
              data and content. For more information, see Advanced data manip-
              ulation .

              InvocationCondition -> (structure)
                 The  condition  used for when a Lambda function should be in-
                 voked.

                 For example, you can specify a condition that  if  there  are
                 empty  date-time  values,  then Amazon Kendra should invoke a
                 function that inserts the current date-time.

                 ConditionDocumentAttributeKey -> (string)
                     The identifier of the document  attribute  used  for  the
                     condition.

                     For  example, 'Source_URI' could be an identifier for the
                     attribute or metadata field that contains source URIs as-
                     sociated with the documents.

                     Amazon  Kendra  currently does not support _document_body
                     as an attribute key used for the condition.

                 Operator -> (string)
                     The condition operator.

                     For example, you can use 'Contains' to partially match  a
                     string.

                 ConditionOnValue -> (structure)
                     The value used by the operator.

                     For  example,  you  can specify the value 'financial' for
                     strings in the 'Source_URI' field that partially match or
                     contain this value.

                     StringValue -> (string)
                        A string, such as "department".

                     StringListValue -> (list)
                        A list of strings.

                        (string)

                     LongValue -> (long)
                        A long integer value.

                     DateValue -> (timestamp)
                        A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                        It  is  important  for the time zone to be included in
                        the  ISO   8601   date-time   format.   For   example,
                        2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00  is  the  ISO 8601 date-time
                        format for March 25th 2012 at 12:30PM  (plus  10  sec-
                        onds) in Central European Time.

              LambdaArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of a role with permission to
                 run a Lambda function during ingestion. For more information,
                 see IAM roles for Amazon Kendra .

              S3Bucket -> (string)
                 Stores  the original, raw documents or the structured, parsed
                 documents before and after altering them. For  more  informa-
                 tion, see Data contracts for Lambda functions .

          PostExtractionHookConfiguration -> (structure)
              Configuration  information  for  invoking  a  Lambda function in
              Lambda on the structured documents with their metadata and  text
              extracted. You can use a Lambda function to apply advanced logic
              for creating, modifying, or deleting document metadata and  con-
              tent. For more information, see Advanced data manipulation .

              InvocationCondition -> (structure)
                 The  condition  used for when a Lambda function should be in-
                 voked.

                 For example, you can specify a condition that  if  there  are
                 empty  date-time  values,  then Amazon Kendra should invoke a
                 function that inserts the current date-time.

                 ConditionDocumentAttributeKey -> (string)
                     The identifier of the document  attribute  used  for  the
                     condition.

                     For  example, 'Source_URI' could be an identifier for the
                     attribute or metadata field that contains source URIs as-
                     sociated with the documents.

                     Amazon  Kendra  currently does not support _document_body
                     as an attribute key used for the condition.

                 Operator -> (string)
                     The condition operator.

                     For example, you can use 'Contains' to partially match  a
                     string.

                 ConditionOnValue -> (structure)
                     The value used by the operator.

                     For  example,  you  can specify the value 'financial' for
                     strings in the 'Source_URI' field that partially match or
                     contain this value.

                     StringValue -> (string)
                        A string, such as "department".

                     StringListValue -> (list)
                        A list of strings.

                        (string)

                     LongValue -> (long)
                        A long integer value.

                     DateValue -> (timestamp)
                        A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                        It  is  important  for the time zone to be included in

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FailedDocuments -> (list)
          A  list  of  documents  that were not added to the index because the
          document failed a validation check. Each document contains an  error
          message that indicates why the document couldn't be added to the in-
          dex.

          If there was an error adding a document to an index the error is re-
          ported in your Amazon Web Services CloudWatch log. For more informa-
          tion, see Monitoring Amazon Kendra with Amazon CloudWatch Logs

          (structure)
              Provides information about a document that could not be indexed.

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the document.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
