QUERY()                                                                QUERY()



NAME
       query -

DESCRIPTION
       Searches  an  active index. Use this API to search your documents using
       query. The Query operation enables to do faceted search and  to  filter
       results based on document attributes.

       It  also enables you to provide user context that Amazon Kendra uses to
       enforce document access control in the search results.

       Amazon Kendra searches your index for text content and question and an-
       swer (FAQ) content. By default the response contains three types of re-
       sults.

       o Relevant passages

       o Matching FAQs

       o Relevant documents

       You can specify that the query return only one type of result using the
       QueryResultTypeConfig parameter.

       Each query returns the 100 most relevant results.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            query
          --index-id <value>
          [--query-text <value>]
          [--attribute-filter <value>]
          [--facets <value>]
          [--requested-document-attributes <value>]
          [--query-result-type-filter <value>]
          [--document-relevance-override-configurations <value>]
          [--page-number <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--sorting-configuration <value>]
          [--user-context <value>]
          [--visitor-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The  unique identifier of the index to search. The identifier is re-
          turned in the response from the CreateIndex operation.

       --query-text (string)
          The text to search for.

       --attribute-filter (structure)
          Enables filtered searches based on document attributes. You can only
          provide one attribute filter; however, the AndAllFilters , NotFilter
          , and OrAllFilters parameters contain a list of other filters.

          The AttributeFilter parameter enables you to create a set of filter-
          ing  rules  that a document must satisfy to be included in the query
          results.

          AndAllFilters -> (list)
              Performs a logical AND operation on all supplied filters.

              (structure)
                 Provides filtering the query results based  on  document  at-
                 tributes.

                 When  you use the AndAllFilters or OrAllFilters , filters you
                 can use 2 layers under the first attribute filter. For  exam-
                 ple, you can use:
                     <AndAllFilters>

                 o <OrAllFilters>

                 o <EqualsTo>

                 If you use more than 2 layers, you receive a ValidationExcep-
                 tion exception with the message "AttributeFilter cannot  have
                 a depth of more than 2."

                 If you use more than 10 attribute filters in a given list for
                 AndAllFilters or OrAllFilters , you receive  a  ValidationEx-
                 ception  with  the  message  "AttributeFilter  cannot  have a
                 length of more than 10".

                 AndAllFilters -> (list)
                     Performs a logical AND operation on all supplied filters.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                 OrAllFilters -> (list)
                     Performs a logical OR operation on all supplied filters.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                 ( ... recursive ... )EqualsTo -> (structure)

       --facets (list)
          An array of documents attributes. Amazon Kendra returns a count  for
          each  attribute  key specified. You can use this information to help
          narrow the search for your user.

          (structure)
              Information about a document attribute

              DocumentAttributeKey -> (string)
                 The unique key for the document attribute.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DocumentAttributeKey=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "DocumentAttributeKey": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --requested-document-attributes (list)
          An array of document attributes to include in the response. No other
          document  attributes  are  included  in the response. By default all
          document attributes are included in the response.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --query-result-type-filter (string)
          Sets the type of query. Only results for the  specified  query  type
          are returned.

          Possible values:

          o DOCUMENT

          o QUESTION_ANSWER

          o ANSWER

       --document-relevance-override-configurations (list)
          Overrides  relevance  tuning  configurations of fields or attributes
          set at the index level.

          If you use this API to override the relevance tuning  configured  at
          the  index level, but there is no relevance tuning configured at the
          index level, then Amazon Kendra does not apply any relevance tuning.

          If there is relevance tuning configured at the index level, but  you
          do  not  use this API to override any relevance tuning in the index,
          then Amazon Kendra uses the relevance tuning that is  configured  at
          the index level.

          If  there  is  relevance  tuning  configured for fields at the index
          level, but you use this API to override only some of  these  fields,
          then  for  the fields you did not override, the importance is set to
          1.

          (structure)
              Overrides the document relevance properties of  a  custom  index
              field.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  tuning configuration to override document
                 relevance at the index level.

              Relevance -> (structure)
                 Provides information for manually tuning the relevance  of  a
                 field in a search. When a query includes terms that match the
                 field, the results are given a boost in the response based on
                 these tuning parameters.

                 Freshness -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  that this field determines how "fresh" a docu-
                     ment is. For example, if document 1 was created on Novem-
                     ber 5, and document 2 was created on October 31, document
                     1 is "fresher" than document 2.  You  can  only  set  the
                     Freshness  field  on one DATE type field. Only applies to
                     DATE fields.

                 Importance -> (integer)
                     The relative importance  of  the  field  in  the  search.
                     Larger  numbers provide more of a boost than smaller num-
                     bers.

                 Duration -> (string)
                     Specifies the time period that the boost applies to.  For
                     example,  to  make  the boost apply to documents with the
                     field  value  within  the  last  month,  you  would   use
                     "2628000s".  Once the field value is beyond the specified
                     range, the effect of the boost drops off. The higher  the
                     importance, the faster the effect drops off. If you don't
                     specify a value, the default is 3 months.  The  value  of
                     the  field  is a numeric string followed by the character
                     "s", for example "86400s" for one day, or  "604800s"  for
                     one week.

                     Only applies to DATE fields.

                 RankOrder -> (string)
                     Determines how values should be interpreted.

                     When  the  RankOrder  field is ASCENDING , higher numbers
                     are better. For example, a document with a  rating  score
                     of  10  is  higher  ranking than a document with a rating
                     score of 1.

                     When the RankOrder field is DESCENDING  ,  lower  numbers
                     are  better. For example, in a task tracking application,
                     a priority 1 task is more important  than  a  priority  5
                     task.

                     Only applies to LONG and DOUBLE fields.

                 ValueImportanceMap -> (map)
                     A  list  of values that should be given a different boost
                     when they appear in the result list. For example, if  you
                     are  boosting  a  field  called "department," query terms
                     that match the department field are boosted  in  the  re-
                     sult.  However,  you  can add entries from the department
                     field to boost documents with those values higher.

                     For example, you can add entries to the map with names of
                     departments.  If  you  add "HR",5 and "Legal",3 those de-
                     partments are given special attention when they appear in
                     the  metadata of a document. When those terms appear they
                     are given the specified importance instead of the regular
                     importance for the boost.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (integer)

          Query results are returned in pages the size of the PageSize parame-
          ter. By default, Amazon Kendra returns the first  page  of  results.
          Use this parameter to get result pages after the first one.

       --page-size (integer)
          Sets  the  number  of  results that are returned in each page of re-
          sults. The default page size is 10. The maximum  number  of  results
          returned  is 100. If you ask for more than 100 results, only 100 are
          returned.

       --sorting-configuration (structure)
          Provides information that determines how the results  of  the  query
          are sorted. You can set the field that Amazon Kendra should sort the
          results on, and specify whether the results should be sorted in  as-
          cending  or descending order. In the case of ties in sorting the re-
          sults, the results are sorted by relevance.

          If you don't provide sorting configuration, the results  are  sorted
          by the relevance that Amazon Kendra determines for the result.

          DocumentAttributeKey -> (string)
              The  name  of  the document attribute used to sort the response.
              You can use any field that has the Sortable flag set to true.

              You can also sort by any of the following built-in attributes:

              o _category

              o _created_at

              o _last_updated_at

              o _version

              o _view_count

          SortOrder -> (string)
              The order that the results should be returned  in.  In  case  of
              ties,  the  relevance assigned to the result by Amazon Kendra is
              used as the tie-breaker.

       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
