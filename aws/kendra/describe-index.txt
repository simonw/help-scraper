NAME
       describe-index -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes an existing Amazon Kendra index

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-index
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The name of the index to describe.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Name -> (string)
          The name of the index.

       Id -> (string)
          The name of the index.

       Edition -> (string)
          The Amazon Kendra edition used for the index. You decide the edition
          when you create the index.

       RoleArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM  role  that  gives  Amazon
          Kendra permission to write to your Amazon Cloudwatch logs.

       ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
          The  identifier  of the KMScustomer master key (CMK) used to encrypt
          your data. Amazon Kendra doesn't support asymmetric CMKs.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              The identifier of  the  KMScustomer  master  key  (CMK).  Amazon
              Kendra doesn't support asymmetric CMKs.

       Status -> (string)
          The  current status of the index. When the value is ACTIVE , the in-
          dex is ready for use. If the Status field value is FAILED , the  Er-
          rorMessage field contains a message that explains why.

       Description -> (string)
          The description of the index.

       CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The Unix datetime that the index was created.

       UpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The Unix datetime that the index was last updated.

       DocumentMetadataConfigurations -> (list)
          Configuration  settings for any metadata applied to the documents in
          the index.

          (structure)
              Specifies the properties of a custom index field.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the index field.

              Type -> (string)
                 The data type of the index field.

              Relevance -> (structure)
                 Provides manual tuning parameters to determine how the  field
                 affects the search results.

                 Freshness -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  that this field determines how "fresh" a docu-
                     ment is. For example, if document 1 was created on Novem-
                     ber 5, and document 2 was created on October 31, document
                     1 is "fresher" than document 2.  You  can  only  set  the
                     Freshness  field  on one DATE type field. Only applies to
                     DATE fields.

                 Importance -> (integer)
                     The relative importance  of  the  field  in  the  search.
                     Larger  numbers provide more of a boost than smaller num-
                     bers.

                 Duration -> (string)
                     Specifies the time period that the boost applies to.  For
                     example,  to  make  the boost apply to documents with the
                     field  value  within  the  last  month,  you  would   use
                     "2628000s".  Once the field value is beyond the specified
                     range, the effect of the boost drops off. The higher  the
                     importance, the faster the effect drops off. If you don't
                     specify a value, the default is 3 months.  The  value  of
                     the  field  is a numeric string followed by the character
                     "s", for example "86400s" for one day, or  "604800s"  for
                     one week.

                     Only applies to DATE fields.

                 RankOrder -> (string)
                     Determines how values should be interpreted.

                     When  the  RankOrder  field is ASCENDING , higher numbers
                     are better. For example, a document with a  rating  score
                     of  10  is  higher  ranking than a document with a rating
                     score of 1.

                     When the RankOrder field is DESCENDING  ,  lower  numbers
                     are  better. For example, in a task tracking application,
                     a priority 1 task is more important  than  a  priority  5
                     task.

                     Only applies to LONG and DOUBLE fields.

                 ValueImportanceMap -> (map)
                     A  list  of values that should be given a different boost
                     when they appear in the result list. For example, if  you
                     are  boosting  a  field  called "department," query terms
                     that match the department field are boosted  in  the  re-
                     sult.  However,  you  can add entries from the department
                     field to boost documents with those values higher.

                     For example, you can add entries to the map with names of
                     departments.  If  you  add "HR",5 and "Legal",3 those de-
                     partments are given special attention when they appear in
                     the  metadata of a document. When those terms appear they
                     are given the specified importance instead of the regular
                     importance for the boost.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (integer)

              Search -> (structure)
                 Provides  information  about  how  the field is used during a
                 search.

                 Facetable -> (boolean)
                     Indicates that the field can be  used  to  create  search
                     facets,  a  count of results for each value in the field.
                     The default is false .

                 Searchable -> (boolean)
                     Determines whether the field is used in  the  search.  If
                     the Searchable field is true , you can use relevance tun-
                     ing to manually tune how Amazon Kendra weights the  field
                     in  the search. The default is true for string fields and
                     false for number and date fields.

                 Displayable -> (boolean)
                     Determines whether the field is returned in the query re-
                     sponse. The default is true .

                 Sortable -> (boolean)
                     Determines  whether the field can be used to sort the re-
                     sults of a query. If you specify sorting on a field  that
                     does  not  have  Sortable set to true , Amazon Kendra re-
                     turns an exception. The default is false .

       IndexStatistics -> (structure)
          Provides information about the number of FAQ questions  and  answers
          and the number of text documents indexed.

          FaqStatistics -> (structure)
              The number of question and answer topics in the index.

              IndexedQuestionAnswersCount -> (integer)
                 The  total  number  of FAQ questions and answers contained in
                 the index.

          TextDocumentStatistics -> (structure)
              The number of text documents indexed.

              IndexedTextDocumentsCount -> (integer)
                 The number of text documents indexed.

              IndexedTextBytes -> (long)
                 The total size, in bytes, of the indexed documents.

       ErrorMessage -> (string)
          When th e``Status`` field value is FAILED , the  ErrorMessage  field
          contains a message that explains why.

       CapacityUnits -> (structure)
          For Enterprise edition indexes, you can choose to use additional ca-
          pacity to meet the needs of your application. This contains the  ca-
          pacity  units  used for the index. A 0 for the query capacity or the
          storage capacity indicates that the index is using the  default  ca-
          pacity for the index.

          StorageCapacityUnits -> (integer)
              The  amount of extra storage capacity for an index. A single ca-
              pacity unit provides 30 GB of storage  space  or  100,000  docu-
              ments, whichever is reached first.

          QueryCapacityUnits -> (integer)
              The   amount   of   extra   query  capacity  for  an  index  and
              GetQuerySuggestions capacity.

              A single extra capacity unit for an index provides  0.1  queries
              per second or approximately 8,000 queries per day.
                 GetQuerySuggestions  capacity  is  five times the provisioned
                 query capacity for an index, or  the  base  capacity  of  2.5
                 calls  per second, whichever is higher. For example, the base
                 capacity for an index is 0.1 queries  per  second,  and  Get-
                 QuerySuggestions capacity has a base of 2.5 calls per second.
                 If you add another  0.1  queries  per  second  to  total  0.2
                 queries  per second for an index, the GetQuerySuggestions ca-
                 pacity is 2.5 calls per second (higher than  five  times  0.2
                 queries per second).

       UserTokenConfigurations -> (list)
          The user token configuration for the Amazon Kendra index.

          (structure)
              Provides configuration information for a token configuration.

              JwtTokenTypeConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Information about the JWT token type configuration.

                 KeyLocation -> (string)
                     The location of the key.

                 URL -> (string)
                     The signing key URL.

                 SecretManagerArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (arn) of the secret.

                 UserNameAttributeField -> (string)
                     The user name attribute field.

                 GroupAttributeField -> (string)
                     The group attribute field.

                 Issuer -> (string)
                     The issuer of the token.

                 ClaimRegex -> (string)
                     The regular expression that identifies the claim.

              JsonTokenTypeConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Information about the JSON token type configuration.

                 UserNameAttributeField -> (string)
                     The user name attribute field.

                 GroupAttributeField -> (string)
                     The group attribute field.

       UserContextPolicy -> (string)
          The user context policy for the Amazon Kendra index.

       UserGroupResolutionConfiguration -> (structure)
          Shows whether you have enabled the configuration for fetching access
          levels of groups and users from an Amazon Web Services  Single  Sign
          On identity source.

          UserGroupResolutionMode -> (string)
              The  identity store provider (mode) you want to use to fetch ac-
              cess levels of groups and users. Amazon Web Services Single Sign
              On  is  currently the only available mode. Your users and groups
              must exist in an Amazon Web Services SSO identity source in  or-
              der to use this mode.
