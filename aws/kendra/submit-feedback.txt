SYNOPSIS
            submit-feedback
          --index-id <value>
          --query-id <value>
          [--click-feedback-items <value>]
          [--relevance-feedback-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index that was queried.

       --query-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the specific query for which you are submitting
          feedback. The query ID is returned in the response to the Query  op-
          eration.

       --click-feedback-items (list)
          Tells  Amazon Kendra that a particular search result link was chosen
          by the user.

          (structure)
              Gathers information about when a particular result  was  clicked
              by a user. Your application uses the SubmitFeedback operation to
              provide click information.

              ResultId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the search result that was clicked.

              ClickTime -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix timestamp of the date and time that the  result  was
                 clicked.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResultId=string,ClickTime=timestamp ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ResultId": "string",
              "ClickTime": timestamp
            }
            ...
          ]

       --relevance-feedback-items (list)
          Provides  Amazon  Kendra  with relevant or not relevant feedback for
          whether a particular item was relevant to the search.

          (structure)
              Provides feedback on how relevant a document  is  to  a  search.
              Your  application  uses  the SubmitFeedback operation to provide
              relevance information.

              ResultId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the search result that the user pro-
                 vided relevance feedback for.

              RelevanceValue -> (string)
                 Whether  to  document  was  relevant  or  not relevant to the
                 search.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResultId=string,RelevanceValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ResultId": "string",
              "RelevanceValue": "RELEVANT"|"NOT_RELEVANT"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
