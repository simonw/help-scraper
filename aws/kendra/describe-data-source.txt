NAME
       describe-data-source -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about an Amazon Kendra data source.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-data-source
          --id <value>
          --index-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The unique identifier of the data source to describe.

       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index that contains the data source.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          S3Configuration -> (structure)
              Provides  the  configuration information to connect to an Amazon
              S3 bucket as your data source.

              BucketName -> (string)
                 The name of the bucket that contains the documents.

              InclusionPrefixes -> (list)

                 A list of glob patterns for documents that should be indexed.
                 If a document that matches an inclusion pattern also  matches
                 an exclusion pattern, the document is not indexed.

                 Some examples are:

                 o

                   **
                   .txt*  will  include  all  text files in a directory (files
                   with the extension .txt).

                 System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 169)
                   Inline strong start-string without end-string.

                 o

                 A  list of glob patterns for documents that should not be in-
                 dexed. If a document that matches an inclusion prefix or  in-
                 clusion  pattern also matches an exclusion pattern, the docu-
                 ment is not indexed.

                 Some examples are:

                 o

                   **

                 o internal will exclude all files in a directory that contain
                   'internal' in the file name, such  as  'internal',  'inter-
                   nal_only', 'company_internal'.

                 o */*internal  will  exclude  all internal-related files in a

                 metadata about a single document.

                 S3Prefix -> (string)
                     A  prefix  used to filter metadata configuration files in
                     the Amazon Web Services S3 bucket. The  S3  bucket  might
                     contain  multiple metadata files. Use S3Prefix to include
                     only the desired metadata files.

              AccessControlListConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Provides the path to the S3 bucket  that  contains  the  user
                 context  filtering  files for the data source. For the format

                 the  sever  domain  name as part of the credentials. For more
                 information, see Using a Microsoft SharePoint Data  Source  .
                 For  more  information  about Secrets Manager see What Is Se-
                 crets Manager in the Secrets Manager user guide.

              CrawlAttachments -> (boolean)
                 TRUE to include attachments to documents stored in  your  Mi-

                 Set to TRUE to use the Microsoft SharePoint change log to de-
                 termine the documents that need to be updated in  the  index.
                 Depending  on  the  size of the SharePoint change log, it may
                 take longer for Amazon Kendra to use the change log  than  it
                 takes  it to determine the changed documents using the Amazon
                 Kendra document crawler.

              InclusionPatterns -> (list)
                 A list of regular expression patterns. Documents  that  match
                 the  patterns are included in the index. Documents that don't
                 match the patterns are excluded from the index. If a document
                 matches  both  an inclusion pattern and an exclusion pattern,
                 the document is not included in the index.

                 The regex is applied to the display  URL  of  the  SharePoint
                 document.

                 (string)

              ExclusionPatterns -> (list)
                 A  list  of regular expression patterns. Documents that match
                 the patterns are excluded  from  the  index.  Documents  that
                 don't match the patterns are included in the index. If a doc-
                 ument matches both an exclusion pattern and an inclusion pat-
                 tern, the document is not included in the index.

                 The  regex  is  applied  to the display URL of the SharePoint
                 document.

                     a query response based on user context. The  document  is
                     only  returned  to  users  that  are in one of the groups
                     specified in the UserContext field of the Query API.

              SqlConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Provides information about how Amazon Kendra uses quote marks
                 around SQL identifiers when querying a database data source.

                 QueryIdentifiersEnclosingOption -> (string)
                     Determines whether Amazon Kendra encloses SQL identifiers
                     for tables and column names in  double  quotes  (")  when
                     making a database query.

                     By  default, Amazon Kendra passes SQL identifiers the way
                     that they are entered into the data source configuration.
                     It  does  not  change  the case of identifiers or enclose
                     them in quotes.

                     PostgreSQL internally converts  uppercase  characters  to
                     lower  case  characters  in  identifiers  unless they are
                     quoted. Choosing  this  option  encloses  identifiers  in
                     quotes  so  that  PostgreSQL does not convert the charac-
                     ter's case.

                     For MySQL databases, you must enable the ansi_quotes  op-
                     tion when you set this field to DOUBLE_QUOTES .

          SalesforceConfiguration -> (structure)
              Provides  the configuration information to connect to Salesforce
              as your data source.

                 dex.

              SecretArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of an Secrets Managersecret
                 that contains the key/value pairs required to connect to your

                 is authenticated using the user name and password provided in
                 the  Secrets  Manager secret in the SecretArn field. When you
                 choose OAUTH2 , Amazon  Kendra  is  authenticated  using  the
                 OAuth  token  and  secret provided in the Secrets Manager se-
                 cret, and the user name and password are  used  to  determine
                 which information Amazon Kendra has access to.

                 When you use OAUTH2 authentication, you must generate a token
                 and a client secret using the ServiceNow  console.  For  more

                     indexed.  A space in the list must exist. Otherwise, Ama-
                     zon Kendra logs an error when the data source is synchro-
                     nized.  If  a  space is in both the IncludeSpaces and the
                     ExcludeSpaces list, the space is excluded.

                 the Directory Service console and enable  a  Amazon  WorkDocs
                 site for the directory in the Amazon WorkDocs console.

              CrawlComments -> (boolean)
                     TRUE  to include comments on documents in your index. In-
                     cluding comments in your index means each  comment  is  a
                     document that can be searched on.

                 The default is set to FALSE .

              UseChangeLog -> (boolean)
                     TRUE  to  use the change logs to update documents in your
                     index instead of scanning all documents.

                 If you are syncing your Amazon WorkDocs data source with your
                 index  for  the  first time, all documents are scanned. After
                 your first sync, you can use the change logs to  update  your
                 documents in your index for future syncs.

                 The default is set to FALSE .

              InclusionPatterns -> (list)
                 A  list  of  regular  expression  patterns to include certain
                 files in your Amazon WorkDocs  site  repository.  Files  that
                 match  the  patterns  are  included  in the index. Files that
                 don't match the patterns are excluded from the  index.  If  a
                 file  matches both an inclusion pattern and an exclusion pat-
                 tern, the exclusion pattern takes  precedence  and  the  file
                 isnt included in the index.

                 (string)

              ExclusionPatterns -> (list)
                 A  list  of  regular  expression  patterns to exclude certain
                 files in your Amazon WorkDocs  site  repository.  Files  that
                 match  the  patterns  are excluded from the index. Files that
                 dont match the patterns are included in the index. If a  file
                 matches  both  an inclusion pattern and an exclusion pattern,
                 the exclusion pattern takes precedence and the file isnt  in-
                 cluded in the index.

                        The  identifier of the document attribute used for the
                        condition.

                        For example, 'Source_URI' could be an  identifier  for
                        the  attribute  or metadata field that contains source
                        URIs associated with the documents.

                        Amazon  Kendra  currently  does  not  support   _docu-
                        ment_body as an attribute key used for the condition.

                        The identifier of the  target  document  attribute  or
                        metadata field.

                        For  example,  'Department' could be an identifier for
                        the target attribute or metadata field  that  includes
                        the department names associated with the documents.

                     TargetDocumentAttributeValueDeletion -> (boolean)

                            A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                            It  is  important for the time zone to be included
                            in the ISO 8601  date-time  format.  For  example,
                            2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00    is   the   ISO   8601
                            date-time format for March 25th  2012  at  12:30PM
                            (plus 10 seconds) in Central European Time.

              vanced logic for creating, modifying, or deleting document meta-
              data and content. For more information, see Advanced data manip-
              ulation .

              InvocationCondition -> (structure)
                 The  condition  used for when a Lambda function should be in-
                 voked.

                 For example, you can specify a condition that  if  there  are
                 empty  date-time  values,  then Amazon Kendra should invoke a
                 function that inserts the current date-time.

                     The identifier of the document  attribute  used  for  the
                     condition.

                     For  example, 'Source_URI' could be an identifier for the
                     attribute or metadata field that contains source URIs as-
                     sociated with the documents.

                     Amazon  Kendra  currently does not support _document_body

                     The value used by the operator.

                     For  example,  you  can specify the value 'financial' for
                     strings in the 'Source_URI' field that partially match or
                     contain this value.

                     StringValue -> (string)
                        A string, such as "department".

                     StringListValue -> (list)
                        A list of strings.

                        (string)

                     LongValue -> (long)
                        A long integer value.

                     DateValue -> (timestamp)
                        A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                        It  is  important  for the time zone to be included in
                        the  ISO   8601   date-time   format.   For   example,
                        2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00  is  the  ISO 8601 date-time
                        format for March 25th 2012 at 12:30PM  (plus  10  sec-
                        onds) in Central European Time.

              LambdaArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of a role with permission to
                 run a Lambda function during ingestion. For more information,
                 see IAM roles for Amazon Kendra .

              S3Bucket -> (string)
                 Stores  the original, raw documents or the structured, parsed
                 documents before and after altering them. For  more  informa-
                 tion, see Data contracts for Lambda functions .

          PostExtractionHookConfiguration -> (structure)
              Configuration  information  for  invoking  a  Lambda function in
              Lambda on the structured documents with their metadata and  text
              extracted. You can use a Lambda function to apply advanced logic
              for creating, modifying, or deleting document metadata and  con-
              tent. For more information, see Advanced data manipulation .

              InvocationCondition -> (structure)
                 The  condition  used for when a Lambda function should be in-
                 voked.

                 For example, you can specify a condition that  if  there  are
                 empty  date-time  values,  then Amazon Kendra should invoke a
                 function that inserts the current date-time.

                 ConditionDocumentAttributeKey -> (string)
                     The identifier of the document  attribute  used  for  the
                     condition.

                     For  example, 'Source_URI' could be an identifier for the
                     attribute or metadata field that contains source URIs as-
                     sociated with the documents.

                     Amazon  Kendra  currently does not support _document_body
                     as an attribute key used for the condition.

                 Operator -> (string)
                     The condition operator.

                     For example, you can use 'Contains' to partially match  a
                     string.

                 ConditionOnValue -> (structure)
                     The value used by the operator.

                     For  example,  you  can specify the value 'financial' for
                     strings in the 'Source_URI' field that partially match or
                     contain this value.

                     StringValue -> (string)

                        A list of strings.

                        (string)

                     LongValue -> (long)
                        A long integer value.

                     DateValue -> (timestamp)
                        A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                        It  is  important  for the time zone to be included in
                        the  ISO   8601   date-time   format.   For   example,
                        2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00  is  the  ISO 8601 date-time
