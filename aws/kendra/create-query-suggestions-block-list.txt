       your S3 bucket. In your text file, enter each block word or phrase on a
       separate line.

       For information on the current quota limits for block lists, see Quotas

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index you want to create a  query  suggestions
          block list for.

       --name (string)
          A user friendly name for the block list.

          For example, the block list named 'offensive-words' includes all of-
          fensive words that could appear in  user  queries  and  need  to  be
          blocked from suggestions.

       --description (string)
          A user-friendly description for the block list.

          For  example,  the description "List of all offensive words that can
          appear in user queries and need to be blocked from suggestions."

       --source-s3-path (structure)
          The S3 path to your block list text file in your S3 bucket.

          Each block word or phrase should be on a separate  line  in  a  text
          file.

          For  information  on  the  current quota limits for block lists, see
          Quotas for Amazon Kendra .

          Bucket -> (string)
              The name of the S3 bucket that contains the file.

          Key -> (string)
              The name of the file.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Bucket=string,Key=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Bucket": "string",
            "Key": "string"
          }

       --client-token (string)
          A token that you provide to identify the request to create  a  query
          suggestions block list.

       --role-arn (string)
          The  IAM (Identity and Access Management) role used by Amazon Kendra
          to access the block list text file in your S3 bucket.

          You need permissions to the role ARN (Amazon Web  Services  Resource
          Name).  The  role  needs  S3 read permissions to your file in S3 and
          needs to give STS (Security Token Service) assume  role  permissions
          to Amazon Kendra.

       --tags (list)
          A tag that you can assign to a block list that categorizes the block
          list.

          (structure)
              A list of key/value pairs that identify an index, FAQ,  or  data
              source. Tag keys and values can consist of Unicode letters, dig-
              its, white space, and any of the following symbols: _ . : / =  +
              - @.

              Key -> (string)
                 The  key for the tag. Keys are not case sensitive and must be
                 unique for the index, FAQ, or data source.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value associated with the tag. The value may be an  empty
                 string but it can't be null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Id -> (string)
          The unique identifier of the created block list.
