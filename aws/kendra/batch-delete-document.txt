BATCH-DELETE-DOCUMENT()                                BATCH-DELETE-DOCUMENT()



NAME
       batch-delete-document -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  one  or  more documents from an index. The documents must have
       been added with the BatchPutDocument operation.

       The documents are deleted asynchronously. You can see the  progress  of
       the  deletion  by  using Amazon Web Services CloudWatch. Any error mes-
       sages related to the processing of the batch are sent to you CloudWatch
       log.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-delete-document
          --index-id <value>
          --document-id-list <value>
          [--data-source-sync-job-metric-target <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index that contains the documents to delete.

       --document-id-list (list)
          One or more identifiers for documents to delete from the index.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --data-source-sync-job-metric-target (structure)
          Maps a particular data source sync job to a particular data source.

          DataSourceId -> (string)
              The ID of the data source that is running the sync job.

          DataSourceSyncJobId -> (string)
              The ID of the sync job that is running on the data source.

              If  the ID of a sync job is not provided and there is a sync job
              running, then the ID of this sync job is used  and  metrics  are
              generated for this sync job.

              If the ID of a sync job is not provided and there is no sync job
              running, then no metrics are generated  and  documents  are  in-
              dexed/deleted  at  the  index level without sync job metrics in-
              cluded.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DataSourceId=string,DataSourceSyncJobId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DataSourceId": "string",
            "DataSourceSyncJobId": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FailedDocuments -> (list)
          A list of documents that could not be removed from the  index.  Each
          entry  contains  an  error  message  that indicates why the document
          couldn't be removed from the index.

          (structure)
              Provides information about documents that could not  be  removed
              from an index by the BatchDeleteDocument operation.

              Id -> (string)
                 The  identifier of the document that couldn't be removed from
                 the index.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The error code for why the document couldn't be removed  from
                 the index.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 An  explanation for why the document couldn't be removed from
                 the index.
