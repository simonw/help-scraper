SYNOPSIS
            list-query-suggestions-block-lists
          --index-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index for a list of all block lists that exist
          for that index.

          For information on the current quota limits  for  block  lists,  see
          Quotas for Amazon Kendra .

       --next-token (string)
          If  the previous response was incomplete (because there is more data
          to retrieve), Amazon Kendra returns a pagination token  in  the  re-
          sponse.  You  can use this pagination token to retrieve the next set
          of block lists (BlockListSummaryItems ).

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of block lists to return.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
