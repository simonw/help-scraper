OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The identifier of the index to update.

       --name (string)
          The name of the index to update.

       --role-arn (string)
          A  new  IAM  role that gives Amazon Kendra permission to access your
          Amazon CloudWatch logs.

       --description (string)
          A new description for the index.

       --document-metadata-configuration-updates (list)
          The document metadata you want to update.

          (structure)
              Specifies the properties of a custom index field.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the index field.

              Type -> (string)
                 The data type of the index field.

              Relevance -> (structure)
                 Provides manual tuning parameters to determine how the  field
                 affects the search results.

                 Freshness -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  that this field determines how "fresh" a docu-
                     ment is. For example, if document 1 was created on Novem-
                     ber 5, and document 2 was created on October 31, document
                     1 is "fresher" than document 2.  You  can  only  set  the
                     Freshness  field  on one DATE type field. Only applies to
                     DATE fields.

                 Importance -> (integer)
                     The relative importance  of  the  field  in  the  search.
                     Larger  numbers provide more of a boost than smaller num-
                     bers.

                 Duration -> (string)
                     Specifies the time period that the boost applies to.  For
                     example,  to  make  the boost apply to documents with the
                     field  value  within  the  last  month,  you  would   use
                     "2628000s".  Once the field value is beyond the specified
                     range, the effect of the boost drops off. The higher  the
                     importance, the faster the effect drops off. If you don't
                     specify a value, the default is 3 months.  The  value  of
                     the  field  is a numeric string followed by the character
                     "s", for example "86400s" for one day, or  "604800s"  for
                     one week.

                     Only applies to DATE fields.

                 RankOrder -> (string)
                     Determines how values should be interpreted.

                     When  the  RankOrder  field is ASCENDING , higher numbers
                     are better. For example, a document with a  rating  score
                     of  10  is  higher  ranking than a document with a rating
                     score of 1.

                     When the RankOrder field is DESCENDING  ,  lower  numbers
                     are  better. For example, in a task tracking application,
                     a priority 1 task is more important  than  a  priority  5
                     task.

                     Only applies to LONG and DOUBLE fields.

                 ValueImportanceMap -> (map)
                     A  list  of values that should be given a different boost
                     when they appear in the result list. For example, if  you
                     are  boosting  a  field  called "department," query terms
                     that match the department field are boosted  in  the  re-
                     sult.  However,  you  can add entries from the department
                     field to boost documents with those values higher.

                     For example, you can add entries to the map with names of
                     departments.  If  you  add "HR",5 and "Legal",3 those de-
                     partments are given special attention when they appear in
                     the  metadata of a document. When those terms appear they
                     are given the specified importance instead of the regular
                     importance for the boost.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (integer)

              Search -> (structure)
                 Provides  information  about  how  the field is used during a
                 search.

                 Facetable -> (boolean)
                     Indicates that the field can be  used  to  create  search
                     facets,  a  count of results for each value in the field.
                     The default is false .

                 Searchable -> (boolean)
                     Determines whether the field is used in  the  search.  If
                     the Searchable field is true , you can use relevance tun-
                     ing to manually tune how Amazon Kendra weights the  field
                     in  the search. The default is true for string fields and
                     false for number and date fields.

                 Displayable -> (boolean)
                     Determines whether the field is returned in the query re-
                     sponse. The default is true .

                 Sortable -> (boolean)
                     Determines  whether the field can be used to sort the re-
                     sults of a query. If you specify sorting on a field  that
                     does  not  have  Sortable set to true , Amazon Kendra re-
                     turns an exception. The default is false .

          Name=string,Type=string,Relevance={Freshness=boolean,Importance=integer,Duration=string,RankOrder=string,ValueImportanceMap={KeyName1=integer,KeyName2=integer}},Search={Facetable=boolean,Searchable=boolean,Displayable=boolean,Sortable=boolean} ...

       JSON Syntax:

              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --capacity-units (structure)
          Sets the number of additional storage and query capacity units  that
          should  be used by the index. You can change the capacity of the in-
          dex up to 5 times per day.

          If you are using extra storage units, you can't reduce  the  storage
          capacity  below that required to meet the storage needs for your in-
          dex.

          StorageCapacityUnits -> (integer)
              The amount of extra storage capacity for an index. A single  ca-
              pacity  unit  provides  30  GB of storage space or 100,000 docu-
              ments, whichever is reached first.

          QueryCapacityUnits -> (integer)
              The  amount  of  extra  query  capacity   for   an   index   and
              GetQuerySuggestions capacity.

              A  single  extra capacity unit for an index provides 0.1 queries
              per second or approximately 8,000 queries per day.
                 GetQuerySuggestions capacity is five  times  the  provisioned
                 query  capacity  for  an  index,  or the base capacity of 2.5
                 calls per second, whichever is higher. For example, the  base
                 capacity  for  an  index  is 0.1 queries per second, and Get-
                 QuerySuggestions capacity has a base of 2.5 calls per second.
                 If  you  add  another  0.1  queries  per  second to total 0.2
                 queries per second for an index, the GetQuerySuggestions  ca-
                 pacity  is  2.5  calls per second (higher than five times 0.2
                 queries per second).

          UserGroupResolutionConfiguration .

          UserGroupResolutionMode -> (string)
              The identity store provider (mode) you want to use to fetch  ac-
              cess levels of groups and users. Amazon Web Services Single Sign
              On is currently the only available mode. Your users  and  groups
              must  exist in an Amazon Web Services SSO identity source in or-
              der to use this mode.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          UserGroupResolutionMode=string

          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
