BATCH-GET-DOCUMENT-STATUS()                        BATCH-GET-DOCUMENT-STATUS()



NAME
       batch-get-document-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  indexing  status for one or more documents submitted with
       the BatchPutDocument API.

       When you use the BatchPutDocument  API,  documents  are  indexed  asyn-
       chronously.  You can use the BatchGetDocumentStatus API to get the cur-
       rent status of a list of documents so that you can  determine  if  they
       have been successfully indexed.

       You  can also use the BatchGetDocumentStatus API to check the status of
       the BatchDeleteDocument API. When a document is deleted from the index,
       Amazon Kendra returns NOT_FOUND as the status.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-get-document-status
          --index-id <value>
          --document-info-list <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index to add documents to. The index ID is re-
          turned by the CreateIndex API.

       --document-info-list (list)
          A list of DocumentInfo objects that identify the documents for which
          to  get  the status. You identify the documents by their document ID
          and optional attributes.

          (structure)
              Identifies a document for which to retrieve status information

              DocumentId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the document.

              Attributes -> (list)
                 Attributes that identify a specific version of a document  to
                 check.

                 The only valid attributes are:

                 o version

                 o datasourceId

                 o jobExecutionId

                 The attributes follow these rules:

                 o dataSourceId and jobExecutionId must be used together.

                 o version  is  ignored if dataSourceId and jobExecutionId are
                   not provided.

                 o If dataSourceId and jobExecutionId are provided,  but  ver-
                   sion is not, the version defaults to "0".

                 (structure)
                     A custom attribute value assigned to a document.

                     For more information on how to create custom document at-
                     tributes, see Custom Attributes .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The identifier for the attribute.

                     Value -> (structure)
                        The value of the attribute.

                        StringValue -> (string)
                            A string, such as "department".

                        StringListValue -> (list)
                            A list of strings.

                            (string)

                        LongValue -> (long)
                            A long integer value.

                        DateValue -> (timestamp)
                            A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string.

                            It is important for the time zone to  be  included
                            in  the  ISO  8601  date-time format. For example,
                            2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00   is   the   ISO    8601
                            date-time  format  for  March 25th 2012 at 12:30PM
                            (plus 10 seconds) in Central European Time.

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "DocumentId": "string",
              "Attributes": [
                {
                  "Key": "string",
                  "Value": {
                    "StringValue": "string",
                    "StringListValue": ["string", ...],
                    "LongValue": long,
                    "DateValue": timestamp
                  }
                }
                ...
              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Errors -> (list)
          A  list of documents that Amazon Kendra couldn't get the status for.
          The list includes the ID of the document and  the  reason  that  the
          status couldn't be found.

          (structure)
              Provides  a  response when the status of a document could not be
              retrieved.

              DocumentId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the document whose status could  not
                 be retrieved.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 Indicates the source of the error.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 States  that  the API could not get the status of a document.
                 This could be because the request is not valid or there is  a
                 system error.

       DocumentStatusList -> (list)
          The  status  of  documents.  The status indicates if the document is
          waiting to be indexed, is in the process of indexing, has  completed
          indexing,  or  failed  indexing.  If a document failed indexing, the
          status provides the reason why.

          (structure)
              Provides information about the status of documents submitted for
              indexing.

              DocumentId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the document.

              DocumentStatus -> (string)
                 The current status of a document.

                 If  the  document  was  submitted for deletion, the status is
                 NOT_FOUND after the document is deleted.

              FailureCode -> (string)
                 Indicates the source of the error.

              FailureReason -> (string)
                 Provides detailed information about why the document couldn't
                 be  indexed. Use this information to correct the error before
                 you resubmit the document for indexing.
