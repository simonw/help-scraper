DESCRIPTION
       Gets statistics about synchronizing Amazon Kendra with a data source.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-data-source-sync-jobs
          --id <value>
          --index-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--start-time-filter <value>]
          [--status-filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The identifier of the data source.

       --index-id (string)
          The identifier of the index that contains the data source.

       --next-token (string)
          If  the previous response was incomplete (because there is more data
          to retrieve), Amazon Kendra returns a pagination token  in  the  re-
          sponse.  You  can use this pagination token to retrieve the next set
          of jobs.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of synchronization jobs  to  return  in  the  re-
          sponse.  If  there are fewer results in the list, this response con-
          tains only the actual results.

       --start-time-filter (structure)
          When specified, the synchronization jobs returned in  the  list  are
          limited to jobs between the specified dates.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              The UNIX datetime of the beginning of the time range.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The UNIX datetime of the end of the time range.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          StartTime=timestamp,EndTime=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "StartTime": timestamp,
            "EndTime": timestamp
          }

       --status-filter (string)
          When  specified,  only  returns synchronization jobs with the Status
          field equal to the specified status.

          Possible values:

          o FAILED

          o SUCCEEDED

          o SYNCING

          o INCOMPLETE

          o STOPPING

          o ABORTED

          o SYNCING_INDEXING

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       History -> (list)
          A history of synchronization jobs for the data source.

          (structure)
              Provides information about a synchronization job.

              ExecutionId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the synchronization job.

              StartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The UNIX datetime that the synchronization job was started.

              EndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The UNIX datetime that the synchronization job was completed.

              Status -> (string)
                 The execution status of the  synchronization  job.  When  the
                 Status field is set to SUCCEEDED , the synchronization job is
                 done. If the status code is set to FAILED , the ErrorCode and
                 ErrorMessage fields give you the reason for the failure.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 If  the Status field is set to ERROR , the ErrorMessage field
                 contains a description of the error that caused the  synchro-
                 nization to fail.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 If  the  Status  field is set to FAILED , the ErrorCode field
                 contains a the reason that the synchronization failed.

              DataSourceErrorCode -> (string)
                 If the reason that the synchronization failed is  due  to  an
                 error  with the underlying data source, this field contains a
                 code that identifies the error.

              Metrics -> (structure)
                 Maps a batch delete  document  request  to  a  specific  data
                 source sync job. This is optional and should only be supplied
                 when documents are deleted by a data source connector.

                 DocumentsAdded -> (string)
                     The number of documents added from the data source up  to
                     now in the data source sync.

                 DocumentsModified -> (string)
                     The number of documents modified in the data source up to
                     now in the data source sync run.

                 DocumentsDeleted -> (string)
                     The number of documents deleted from the data  source  up
                     to now in the data source sync run.

                 DocumentsFailed -> (string)
                     The number of documents that failed to sync from the data
                     source up to now in the data source sync run.

                 DocumentsScanned -> (string)
                     The current number of documents crawled  by  the  current
                     sync job in the data source.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the response is truncated, Amazon Kendra returns this token that
          you can use in the subsequent request to retrieve the  next  set  of
          jobs.
