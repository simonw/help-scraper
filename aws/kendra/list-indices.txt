LIST-INDICES()                                                  LIST-INDICES()



NAME
       list-indices -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the Amazon Kendra indexes that you have created.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-indices
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          If  the previous response was incomplete (because there is more data
          to retrieve), Amazon Kendra returns a pagination token  in  the  re-
          sponse.  You  can use this pagination token to retrieve the next set
          of indexes (DataSourceSummaryItems ).

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of data sources to return.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       IndexConfigurationSummaryItems -> (list)
          An  array of summary information on the configuration of one or more
          indexes.

          (structure)
              A summary of information on the configuration of an index.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the index.

              Id -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the index. Use this to  identify  the
                 index when you are using APIs such as Query , DescribeIndex ,
                 UpdateIndex , and DeleteIndex .

              Edition -> (string)
                 Indicates whether the index is a enterprise edition index  or
                 a developer edition index.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix timestamp when the index was created.

              UpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix timestamp when the index was last updated by the Up-
                 dateIndex API.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status of the index. When the status is ACTIVE  ,
                 the index is ready to search.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the response is truncated, Amazon Kendra returns this token that
          you can use in the subsequent request to retrieve the  next  set  of
          indexes.
