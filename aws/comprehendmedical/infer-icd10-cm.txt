INFER-ICD10-CM()                                              INFER-ICD10-CM()



NAME
       infer-icd10-cm -

DESCRIPTION
       InferICD10CM detects medical conditions as entities listed in a patient
       record and links those entities to normalized  concept  identifiers  in
       the ICD-10-CM knowledge base from the Centers for Disease Control. Ama-
       zon Comprehend Medical only detects medical entities  in  English  lan-
       guage texts.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            infer-icd10-cm
          --text <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --text (string)
          The  input  text  used for analysis. The input for InferICD10CM is a
          string from 1 to 10000 characters.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example  1:  To  detect  medical  condition  entities  and  link to the
       ICD-10-CM Ontology directly from text

       The following infer-icd10-cm example labels the detected medical condi-
       tion  entities  and links those entities with codes in the 2019 edition
       of the International Classification of Diseases  Clinical  Modification
       (ICD-10-CM).

          aws comprehendmedical infer-icd10-cm \
              --text "The patient complains of abdominal pain, has a long-standing history of diabetes treated with Micronase daily."

OUTPUT
       Entities -> (list)
          The medical conditions detected in the text linked to ICD-10-CM con-
          cepts. If the action is successful, the service sends back  an  HTTP
          200 response, as well as the entities detected.

          (structure)
              The collection of medical entities extracted from the input text
              and their associated information. For each entity, the  response
              provides  the entity text, the entity category, where the entity
              text begins and ends, and the level of  confidence  that  Amazon
              Comprehend Medical has in the detection and analysis. Attributes
              and traits of the entity are also returned.

              Id -> (integer)
                 The numeric identifier for the entity. This  is  a  monotoni-
                 cally increasing id unique within this response rather than a
                 global unique identifier.

              Text -> (string)
                 The segment of input text that is matched to the detected en-
                 tity.

              Category -> (string)
                 The  category of the entity. InferICD10CM detects entities in
                 the MEDICAL_CONDITION category.

              Type -> (string)
                 Describes the specific type of entity with category of  enti-
                 ties.  InferICD10CM  detects entities of the type DX_NAME and
                 TIME_EXPRESSION .

              Score -> (float)
                 The level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend Medical has in
                 the accuracy of the detection.

              BeginOffset -> (integer)
