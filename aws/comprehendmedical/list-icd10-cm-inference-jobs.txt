DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of InferICD10CM jobs that you have submitted.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-icd10-cm-inference-jobs
          [--filter <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          Filters  the  jobs  that  are returned. You can filter jobs based on
          their names, status, or the date and time that they were  submitted.
          You can only set one filter at a time.

          JobName -> (string)
              Filters on the name of the job.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              Filters  the list of jobs based on job status. Returns only jobs
              with the specified status.

          SubmitTimeBefore -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was sub-
              mitted  for  processing.  Returns only jobs submitted before the
              specified time. Jobs are returned in ascending order, oldest  to
              newest.

          SubmitTimeAfter -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was sub-
              mitted for processing. Returns only  jobs  submitted  after  the
              specified time. Jobs are returned in descending order, newest to
              oldest.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          JobName=string,JobStatus=string,SubmitTimeBefore=timestamp,SubmitTimeAfter=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "JobName": "string",
            "JobStatus": "SUBMITTED"|"IN_PROGRESS"|"COMPLETED"|"PARTIAL_SUCCESS"|"FAILED"|"STOP_REQUESTED"|"STOPPED",
            "SubmitTimeBefore": timestamp,
            "SubmitTimeAfter": timestamp
          }

       --next-token (string)
          Identifies the next page of results to return.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in each page. The default is
          100.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The following example shows how the list-icd10-cm-inference-jobs opera-
       tion returns a list of current asynchronous ICD-10-CM  batch  inference
       jobs.

OUTPUT
       ComprehendMedicalAsyncJobPropertiesList -> (list)
          A list containing the properties of each job that is returned.

          (structure)
              Provides information about a detection job.

              JobId -> (string)
                 The identifier assigned to the detection job.

              JobName -> (string)
                 The name that you assigned to the detection job.

              JobStatus -> (string)
                 The current status of the detection job.  If  the  status  is
                 FAILED , the Message field shows the reason for the failure.

              Message -> (string)
                 A description of the status of a job.

              SubmitTime -> (timestamp)

              EndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the detection job completed.

              ExpirationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time  that  job  metadata is deleted from the
                 server. Output files in your S3 bucket will not  be  deleted.
                 After  the metadata is deleted, the job will no longer appear
                 in the results of the ListEntitiesDetectionV2Job or the List-
                 PHIDetectionJobs operation.

              InputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The  input data configuration that you supplied when you cre-
                 ated the detection job.

                 S3Bucket -> (string)

                     The bucket must be in the same region as the API endpoint
                     that you are calling.

                     Each file in the document collection must be less than 40
                     KB. You can store a maximum of 30 GB in the bucket.

                 S3Key -> (string)
                     The path to the input data files in the S3 bucket.

              OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The output data configuration that you supplied when you cre-
                 ated the detection job.

                 S3Bucket -> (string)
                     When you use the OutputDataConfig object  with  asynchro-
                     nous operations, you specify the Amazon S3 location where
                     you want to write the output data. The URI must be in the
                     same region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The
                     location is used as the prefix for the actual location of
                     the output.

                 S3Key -> (string)
                     The  path to the output data files in the S3 bucket. Com-
                     prehend Medical; creates an output  directory  using  the
                     job ID so that the output from one job does not overwrite
                     the output of another.

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 The language code of the input documents.

              DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)

                 the output files.

              ModelVersion -> (string)
                 The  version  of the model used to analyze the documents. The
                 version number looks like X.X.X. You can use this information
