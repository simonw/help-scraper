OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          Filters  the  jobs  that  are returned. You can filter jobs based on
          their names, status, or the date and time that they were  submitted.
          You can only set one filter at a time.

          JobName -> (string)
              Filters on the name of the job.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              Filters  the list of jobs based on job status. Returns only jobs
              with the specified status.

          SubmitTimeBefore -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was sub-
              mitted  for  processing.  Returns only jobs submitted before the
              specified time. Jobs are returned in ascending order, oldest  to
              newest.

          SubmitTimeAfter -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was sub-
              mitted for processing. Returns only  jobs  submitted  after  the
              specified time. Jobs are returned in descending order, newest to
              oldest.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          JobName=string,JobStatus=string,SubmitTimeBefore=timestamp,SubmitTimeAfter=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "JobName": "string",
            "JobStatus": "SUBMITTED"|"IN_PROGRESS"|"COMPLETED"|"PARTIAL_SUCCESS"|"FAILED"|"STOP_REQUESTED"|"STOPPED",
            "SubmitTimeBefore": timestamp,
            "SubmitTimeAfter": timestamp
          }

       --next-token (string)
          Identifies the next page of results to return.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in each page. The default is
          100.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following example shows how the list-icd10-cm-inference-jobs opera-
       tion  returns  a list of current asynchronous ICD-10-CM batch inference
       jobs.

OUTPUT
       ComprehendMedicalAsyncJobPropertiesList -> (list)
          A list containing the properties of each job that is returned.

          (structure)
              Provides information about a detection job.

              JobId -> (string)
                 The identifier assigned to the detection job.

              JobName -> (string)
                 The name that you assigned to the detection job.

              JobStatus -> (string)
                 The  current  status  of  the detection job. If the status is
                 FAILED , the Message field shows the reason for the failure.

              Message -> (string)
                 A description of the status of a job.

              SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the detection job was submitted for processing.

              EndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the detection job completed.

              ExpirationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that  job  metadata  is  deleted  from  the
                 server.  Output  files in your S3 bucket will not be deleted.
                 After the metadata is deleted, the job will no longer  appear
                 in the results of the ListEntitiesDetectionV2Job or the List-
                 PHIDetectionJobs operation.

              InputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The input data configuration that you supplied when you  cre-
                 ated the detection job.

                 S3Bucket -> (string)
                     The  URI  of  the S3 bucket that contains the input data.
                     The bucket must be in the same region as the API endpoint
                     that you are calling.

                 S3Key -> (string)
                     The path to the input data files in the S3 bucket.

              OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The output data configuration that you supplied when you cre-
                 ated the detection job.

                 S3Bucket -> (string)
                     When you use the OutputDataConfig object  with  asynchro-
                     nous operations, you specify the Amazon S3 location where
                     you want to write the output data. The URI must be in the
                     same region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The
                     location is used as the prefix for the actual location of
                     the output.

                 S3Key -> (string)
                     The  path to the output data files in the S3 bucket. Ama-
                     zon Comprehend Medical creates an output directory  using
                     the job ID so that the output from one job does not over-
                     write the output of another.

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 The language code of the input documents.

              DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that gives  Amazon  Comprehend
                 Medical read access to your input data.

              ManifestFilePath -> (string)
                 The  path  to  the file that describes the results of a batch
                 job.

                 the output files.

              ModelVersion -> (string)
                 The  version  of the model used to analyze the documents. The
                 version number looks like X.X.X. You can use this information
                 to track the model used for a particular batch of documents.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Identifies the next page of results to return.
