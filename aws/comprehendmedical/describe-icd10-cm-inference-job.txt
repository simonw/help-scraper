          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The identifier that Amazon Comprehend Medical generated for the job.
          The  StartICD10CMInferenceJob  operation  returns this identifier in
          its response.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       ComprehendMedicalAsyncJobProperties -> (structure)
          An object that contains the properties associated with  a  detection
          job.

          JobId -> (string)
              The identifier assigned to the detection job.

          JobName -> (string)
              The name that you assigned to the detection job.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the detection job. If the status is FAILED
              , the Message field shows the reason for the failure.

          Message -> (string)
              A description of the status of a job.

          SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the detection job was submitted for processing.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the detection job completed.

          ExpirationTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that job metadata is deleted from the  server.
              Output  files  in  your S3 bucket will not be deleted. After the
              metadata is deleted, the job will no longer appear  in  the  re-
              sults of the ListEntitiesDetectionV2Job or the ListPHIDetection-
              Jobs operation.

          InputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The input data configuration that you supplied when you  created
              the detection job.

              S3Bucket -> (string)
                 The  URI  of  the S3 bucket that contains the input data. The
                 bucket must be in the same region as the  API  endpoint  that
                 you are calling.

              S3Key -> (string)
                 The path to the input data files in the S3 bucket.

          OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The output data configuration that you supplied when you created
              the detection job.

              S3Bucket -> (string)
                 When you use the OutputDataConfig  object  with  asynchronous
                 operations, you specify the Amazon S3 location where you want
                 to write the output data. The URI must be in the same  region
                 as  the  API  endpoint  that you are calling. The location is
                 used as the prefix for the actual location of the output.

              S3Key -> (string)
                 The path to the output data files in the  S3  bucket.  Amazon
                 Comprehend  Medical creates an output directory using the job
                 ID so that the output from one job  does  not  overwrite  the
                 output of another.

          LanguageCode -> (string)
              The language code of the input documents.

          DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that gives Amazon Comprehend Med-
              ical read access to your input data.

          ManifestFilePath -> (string)
              The path to the file that describes the results of a batch job.

          KMSKey -> (string)
              The AWS Key Management Service key, if any, used to encrypt  the
              output files.

          ModelVersion -> (string)
              The version of the model used to analyze the documents. The ver-
              sion number looks like X.X.X. You can use  this  information  to
              track the model used for a particular batch of documents.
