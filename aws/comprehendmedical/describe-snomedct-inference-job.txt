NAME
       describe-snomedct-inference-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the properties associated with an InferSNOMEDCT job. Use this op-
       eration to get the status of an inference job.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-snomedct-inference-job
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The identifier that Amazon Comprehend Medical generated for the job.
          The  StartSNOMEDCTInferenceJob  operation returns this identifier in
          its response.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       ComprehendMedicalAsyncJobProperties -> (structure)
          Provides information about a detection job.

          JobId -> (string)
              The identifier assigned to the detection job.

          JobName -> (string)
              The name that you assigned to the detection job.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the detection job. If the status is FAILED
              , the Message field shows the reason for the failure.

          Message -> (string)
              A description of the status of a job.

          SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the detection job was submitted for processing.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the detection job completed.

          ExpirationTime -> (timestamp)
              The  date and time that job metadata is deleted from the server.
              Output files in your S3 bucket will not be  deleted.  After  the
              metadata  is  deleted,  the job will no longer appear in the re-
              sults of the ListEntitiesDetectionV2Job or the ListPHIDetection-
              Jobs operation.

          InputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The  input data configuration that you supplied when you created
              the detection job.

              S3Bucket -> (string)
                 The URI of the S3 bucket that contains the  input  data.  The
                 bucket  must  be  in the same region as the API endpoint that
                 you are calling.

                 Each file in the document collection must be less than 40 KB.
                 You can store a maximum of 30 GB in the bucket.

              S3Key -> (string)
                 The path to the input data files in the S3 bucket.

          OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The output data configuration that you supplied when you created
              the detection job.

              S3Bucket -> (string)
                 When you use the OutputDataConfig  object  with  asynchronous
                 operations, you specify the Amazon S3 location where you want
                 to write the output data. The URI must be in the same  region
                 as  the  API  endpoint  that you are calling. The location is
                 used as the prefix for the actual location of the output.

              S3Key -> (string)
                 The path to the output data files in the S3  bucket.  Compre-
                 hend Medical; creates an output directory using the job ID so
                 that the output from one job does not overwrite the output of
                 another.

          LanguageCode -> (string)
              The language code of the input documents.

          DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) that gives Comprehend Medical;
              read access to your input data.

          ManifestFilePath -> (string)
              The path to the file that describes the results of a batch job.

          KMSKey -> (string)
              The AWS Key Management Service key, if any, used to encrypt  the
              output files.

          ModelVersion -> (string)
              The version of the model used to analyze the documents. The ver-
              sion number looks like X.X.X. You can use  this  information  to
              track the model used for a particular batch of documents.
