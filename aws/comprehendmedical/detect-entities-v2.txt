DETECT-ENTITIES-V2()                                      DETECT-ENTITIES-V2()



NAME
       detect-entities-v2 -

DESCRIPTION
       Inspects  the  clinical  text for a variety of medical entities and re-
       turns specific information about them such as  entity  category,  loca-
       tion, and confidence score on that information. Amazon Comprehend Medi-
       cal only detects medical entities in English language texts.

       The DetectEntitiesV2 operation replaces the  DetectEntities  operation.
       This  new action uses a different model for determining the entities in
       your medical text and changes the way that some entities  are  returned
       in the output. You should use the DetectEntitiesV2 operation in all new
       applications.

       The DetectEntitiesV2 operation returns the Acuity and  Direction  enti-
       ties as attributes instead of types.

OPTIONS
       --text (string)
          A  UTF-8  string  containing the clinical content being examined for
          entities.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To detect entities directly from text

       The  following  detect-entities-v2  example shows the detected entities
       and labels them according to type, directly from input text.

          aws comprehendmedical detect-entities-v2 \
              --text "Sleeping trouble on present dosage of Clonidine. Severe rash on face and leg, slightly itchy."

       Output:

          {
              "Id": 0,
              "BeginOffset": 38,
              "EndOffset": 47,
              "Score": 0.9942955374717712,
              "Text": "Clonidine",
              "Category": "MEDICATION",
              "Type": "GENERIC_NAME",
              "Traits": []
          }

       Example 2: To detect entities from a file path

       The  following  detect-entities-v2  example shows the detected entities
       and labels them according to type from a file path.

          aws comprehendmedical detect-entities-v2 \
              --text file://medical_entities.txt

OUTPUT
       Entities -> (list)
          The collection of medical entities extracted from the input text and
          their associated information. For each entity, the response provides
          the  entity  text, the entity category, where the entity text begins
          and ends, and the level of confidence in the detection and analysis.
          Attributes and traits of the entity are also returned.

          (structure)
              Provides information about an extracted medical entity.

              Id -> (integer)
                 The  numeric  identifier  for the entity. This is a monotoni-
                 cally increasing id unique within this response rather than a
                 global unique identifier.

              BeginOffset -> (integer)
                 The  0-based  character  offset  in the input text that shows
                 where the entity begins. The offset returns  the  UTF-8  code
                 point in the string.

              EndOffset -> (integer)
                 The  0-based  character  offset  in the input text that shows
                 where the entity ends. The  offset  returns  the  UTF-8  code
                 point in the string.

              Score -> (float)
                 The level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend Medical has in
                 the accuracy of the detection.

              Text -> (string)
                 The segment of input text extracted as this entity.

              Category -> (string)
                 The category of the entity.

                 ties.

              Traits -> (list)
                 Contextual information for the entity.

                     an entity, or otherwise related to an entity, such as the
                     dosage of a medication  taken.  It  contains  information
                     about  the  attribute  such  as  id, begin and end offset
                     within the input text, and the segment of the input text.

                        shows where the attribute ends. The offset returns the
                        UTF-8 code point in the string.

                     Text -> (string)
                        The segment of input text extracted as this attribute.
