INFER-RX-NORM()                                                INFER-RX-NORM()



NAME
       infer-rx-norm -

DESCRIPTION
       InferRxNorm  detects medications as entities listed in a patient record
       and links to the normalized concept identifiers in the RxNorm  database
       from  the  National Library of Medicine. Amazon Comprehend Medical only
       detects medical entities in English language texts.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            infer-rx-norm
          --text <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --text (string)
          The input text used for analysis. The input  for  InferRxNorm  is  a
          string from 1 to 10000 characters.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example  1:  To  detect medication entities and link to RxNorm directly
       from text

       The following infer-rx-norm example shows and labels the detected medi-
       cation entities and links those entities to concept identifiers (RxCUI)
       from the National Library of Medicine RxNorm database.

          aws comprehendmedical infer-rx-norm \
              --text "Patient reports taking Levothyroxine 125 micrograms p.o. once daily, but denies taking Synthroid."

OUTPUT
       Entities -> (list)
          The  medication  entities detected in the text linked to RxNorm con-
          cepts. If the action is successful, the service sends back  an  HTTP
          200 response, as well as the entities detected.

          (structure)
              The collection of medical entities extracted from the input text
              and their associated information. For each entity, the  response
              provides  the entity text, the entity category, where the entity
              text begins and ends, and the level of  confidence  that  Amazon
              Comprehend Medical has in the detection and analysis. Attributes
              and traits of the entity are also returned.

              Id -> (integer)
                 The numeric identifier for the entity. This  is  a  monotoni-
                 cally increasing id unique within this response rather than a
                 global unique identifier.

              Text -> (string)
                 The segment of input text extracted from which the entity was
                 detected.

              Category -> (string)
                 The  category  of  the  entity. The recognized categories are

              Type -> (string)
                 Describes the specific type of entity. For  InferRxNorm,  the
                 recognized entity type is MEDICATION .

                 the accuracy of the detected entity.

              BeginOffset -> (integer)
                 The 0-based character offset in the  input  text  that  shows
                 where  the  entity  begins. The offset returns the UTF-8 code
                 point in the string.

              EndOffset -> (integer)
                 The 0-based character offset in the  input  text  that  shows
                 where  the  entity  ends.  The  offset returns the UTF-8 code
                 point in the string.

              Attributes -> (list)
                 The extracted attributes that relate to the entity.  The  at-
                 tributes  recognized  by  InferRxNorm are DOSAGE , DURATION ,
