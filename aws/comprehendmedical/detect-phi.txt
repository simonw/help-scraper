DETECT-PHI()                                                      DETECT-PHI()



NAME
       detect-phi -

DESCRIPTION
       Inspects the clinical text for protected health information (PHI) enti-
       ties and returns the entity category, location,  and  confidence  score
       for  each  entity.  Amazon  Comprehend Medical only detects entities in
       English language texts.

OPTIONS
       --text (string)
          A UTF-8 text string containing the clinical content  being  examined
          for PHI entities.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       Entities -> (list)
          The collection of PHI entities extracted from  the  input  text  and
          their associated information. For each entity, the response provides
          the entity text, the entity category, where the entity  text  begins
          and ends, and the level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend Medical
          has in its detection.

          (structure)
              Provides information about an extracted medical entity.

              Id -> (integer)
                 The numeric identifier for the entity. This  is  a  monotoni-
                 cally increasing id unique within this response rather than a
                 global unique identifier.

              BeginOffset -> (integer)
                 The 0-based character offset in the  input  text  that  shows
                 where  the  entity  begins. The offset returns the UTF-8 code
                 point in the string.

              EndOffset -> (integer)
                 The 0-based character offset in the  input  text  that  shows
                 where  the  entity  ends.  The  offset returns the UTF-8 code
                 point in the string.

              Score -> (float)
                 The level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend Medical has in
                 the accuracy of the detection.

              Text -> (string)
                 The segment of input text extracted as this entity.

              Category -> (string)
                 The category of the entity.

                 Describes  the specific type of entity with category of enti-
                 ties.

              Traits -> (list)
                 Contextual information for the entity.

                 (structure)
                     Provides contextual information about the  extracted  en-
                     tity.

                     Name -> (string)
                        Provides  a  name  or contextual description about the
                        trait.

                     Score -> (float)
                        The level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend Medical
                        has in the accuracy of this trait.

              Attributes -> (list)
                 The extracted attributes that relate to this entity.

                 (structure)
                     An  extracted segment of the text that is an attribute of
                     an entity, or otherwise related to an entity, such as the
                     dosage  of  a  medication  taken. It contains information
                     about the attribute such as  id,  begin  and  end  offset
                     within the input text, and the segment of the input text.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The type of attribute.

                     Score -> (float)
                        The level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend Medical

                        as an attribute.

                     RelationshipScore -> (float)
                        The level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend Medical
                        has that this attribute is correctly related  to  this
                        entity.

                     RelationshipType -> (string)
                        The type of relationship between the entity and attri-
                        bute. Type for the relationship is OVERLAP ,  indicat-
                        ing  that  the entity occurred at the same time as the
                        Date_Expression .

                     Id -> (integer)
                        The numeric identifier for this attribute. This  is  a
                        monotonically  increasing  id  unique  within this re-
                        sponse rather than a global unique identifier.

                     BeginOffset -> (integer)
                        The 0-based character offset in the  input  text  that
                        shows  where  the attribute begins. The offset returns
                        the UTF-8 code point in the string.

                     EndOffset -> (integer)
                        The 0-based character offset in the  input  text  that
                        shows where the attribute ends. The offset returns the
                        UTF-8 code point in the string.

                     Text -> (string)
                        The segment of input text extracted as this attribute.

                     Category -> (string)
