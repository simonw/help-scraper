OPTIONS
       --home-directory (string)
          The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log  in  to  the
          server using the client.

          A HomeDirectory example is /bucket_name/home/mydirectory .

       --home-directory-type (string)
          The type of landing directory (folder) you want your users' home di-
          rectory to be when they log into the server. If you set it to PATH ,
          the  user  will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or EFS paths as is
          in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it LOGICAL , you
          need  to  provide  mappings in the HomeDirectoryMappings for how you
          want to make Amazon S3 or EFS paths visible to your users.

          Possible values:

          o PATH

          o LOGICAL

       --home-directory-mappings (list)
          Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS
          paths  and  keys  should be visible to your user and how you want to
          make them visible. You must specify the Entry and Target pair, where
          Entry  shows  how  the path is made visible and Target is the actual
          Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a  target,  it  is
          displayed  as is. You also must ensure that your Amazon Web Services
          Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access  to  paths
          in Target . This value can only be set when HomeDirectoryType is set
          to LOGICAL .

          The following is an Entry and Target pair example.
              [ { "Entry": "/directory1",  "Target":  "/bucket_name/home/mydi-
              rectory" } ]

          In  most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy
          to lock down your user to the designated home directory ("chroot ").
          To  do  this, you can set Entry to '/' and set Target to the HomeDi-
          rectory parameter value.

          The following is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot .
              [ { "Entry:": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ]

          (structure)
              Represents an object that contains entries and targets for Home-
              DirectoryMappings .

              The following is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot .
                 [  { "Entry:": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory"
                 } ]

              Entry -> (string)
                 Represents an entry for HomeDirectoryMappings .

              Target -> (string)
                 Represents the map target that  is  used  in  a  HomeDirecto-
                 rymapEntry .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Entry=string,Target=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Entry": "string",
              "Target": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --policy (string)
          A session policy for your user so that you can use the same IAM role
          across multiple users. This policy scopes down user access  to  por-
          tions  of  their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside
          this policy include ${Transfer:UserName} , ${Transfer:HomeDirectory}
          , and ${Transfer:HomeBucket} .

          NOTE:
              This  only  applies  when the domain of ServerId is S3. EFS does
              not use session policies.

              For session policies, Amazon Web Services Transfer Family stores
              the  policy  as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name
              (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass
              it in the Policy argument.

              For  an example of a session policy, see Creating a session pol-
              icy .

              For more information, see AssumeRole in the Amazon Web  Services
              Security Token Service API Reference .

       --posix-profile (structure)
          Specifies  the  full POSIX identity, including user ID (Uid ), group
          ID (Gid ), and any secondary groups IDs (SecondaryGids ), that  con-
          trols your users' access to your Amazon Elastic File Systems (Amazon
          EFS). The POSIX permissions that are set on files and directories in
          your  file system determines the level of access your users get when
          transferring files into and out of your Amazon EFS file systems.

          Uid -> (long)
              The POSIX user ID used for all EFS operations by this user.

          Gid -> (long)
              The POSIX group ID used for all EFS operations by this user.

          SecondaryGids -> (list)
              The secondary POSIX group IDs used for  all  EFS  operations  by
              this user.

              (long)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Uid=long,Gid=long,SecondaryGids=long,long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Uid": long,
            "Gid": long,
            "SecondaryGids": [long, ...]
          }

       --role (string)
          Specifies  the  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that con-
          trols your users' access to your Amazon S3 bucket or EFS  file  sys-
          tem.  The  policies attached to this role determine the level of ac-
          cess that you want to provide your  users  when  transferring  files
          into  and  out  of your Amazon S3 bucket or EFS file system. The IAM
          role should also contain a trust relationship that allows the server
          to  access  your  resources  when servicing your users' transfer re-
          quests.

       --server-id (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier for a server instance  that  the
          user account is assigned to.

       --user-name (string)
          A  unique  string  that  identifies  a user and is associated with a
          server as specified by the ServerId . This user name must be a mini-
          mum  of  3  and  a maximum of 100 characters long. The following are
          valid characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, underscore '_', hyphen '-',  period
          '.',  and  at sign '@'. The user name can't start with a hyphen, pe-
          riod, or at sign.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ServerId -> (string)
          A  system-assigned  unique identifier for a server instance that the
          user account is assigned to.

       UserName -> (string)
          The unique identifier for a user that is assigned to  a  server  in-
          stance that was specified in the request.
