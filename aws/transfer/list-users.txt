LIST-USERS()                                                      LIST-USERS()



NAME
       list-users -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  users  for a file transfer protocol-enabled server that you
       specify by passing the ServerId parameter.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-users
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          --server-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies the number of users to return as a response  to  the  Lis-
          tUsers request.

       --next-token (string)
          When you can get additional results from the ListUsers call, a Next-
          Token parameter is returned in the output. You can then  pass  in  a
          subsequent  command  to  the NextToken parameter to continue listing
          additional users.

       --server-id (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier for a server that has users  as-
          signed to it.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          When you can get additional results from the ListUsers call, a Next-
          Token  parameter  is  returned in the output. You can then pass in a
          subsequent command to the NextToken parameter  to  continue  listing
          additional users.

       ServerId -> (string)
          A  system-assigned unique identifier for a server that the users are
          assigned to.

       Users -> (list)
          Returns the user accounts and  their  properties  for  the  ServerId
          value that you specify.

          (structure)
              Returns properties of the user that you specify.

              Arn -> (string)
                 Provides  the  unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the user
                 that you want to learn about.

              HomeDirectory -> (string)
                 The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to
                 the server using the client.

                 A HomeDirectory example is /bucket_name/home/mydirectory .

              HomeDirectoryType -> (string)
                 The  type  of landing directory (folder) you want your users'
                 home directory to be when they log into the  server.  If  you
                 set  it  to  PATH  , the user will see the absolute Amazon S3
                 bucket or EFS paths as is in  their  file  transfer  protocol
                 clients. If you set it LOGICAL , you need to provide mappings
                 in the HomeDirectoryMappings for how you want to make  Amazon
                 S3 or EFS paths visible to your users.

              Role -> (string)
                 Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that
                 controls your users' access to your Amazon S3 bucket  or  EFS
                 file system. The policies attached to this role determine the
                 level of access that you want  to  provide  your  users  when
                 transferring  files  into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or
                 EFS file system. The IAM role should also contain a trust re-
                 lationship  that  allows  the server to access your resources
                 when servicing your users' transfer requests.

                 NOTE:
                     The IAM role that controls your  users'  access  to  your
                     Amazon S3 bucket for servers with Domain=S3 , or your EFS
                     file system for servers with Domain=EFS .

                     The policies attached to this role determine the level of
                     access  you  want to provide your users when transferring
                     files into and out of your S3 buckets or  EFS  file  sys-
                     tems.

              SshPublicKeyCount -> (integer)
                 Specifies  the  number of SSH public keys stored for the user
                 you specified.

              UserName -> (string)
                 Specifies the name of the user whose ARN was specified.  User
                 names are used for authentication purposes.
