START-SERVER()                                                  START-SERVER()



NAME
       start-server -

DESCRIPTION
       Changes  the state of a file transfer protocol-enabled server from OFF-
       LINE to ONLINE . It has no impact on a server that is already ONLINE  .
       An ONLINE server can accept and process file transfer jobs.

       The  state  of STARTING indicates that the server is in an intermediate
       state, either not fully able to respond, or not fully online. The  val-
       ues of START_FAILED can indicate an error condition.

       No response is returned from this call.

SYNOPSIS
            start-server
          --server-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --server-id (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier for a server that you start.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
