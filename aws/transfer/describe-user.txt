OPTIONS
       --server-id (string)
          A  system-assigned unique identifier for a server that has this user
          assigned.

       --user-name (string)
          The name of the user assigned to one or more servers. User names are
          part  of  the sign-in credentials to use the Transfer Family service
          and perform file transfer tasks.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ServerId -> (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier for a server that has this  user
          assigned.

       User -> (structure)
          An  array  containing the properties of the Transfer Family user for
          the ServerID value that you specified.

          Arn -> (string)
              Specifies the unique Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  for  the  user
              that was requested to be described.

          HomeDirectory -> (string)
              The  landing  directory  (folder) for a user when they log in to
              the server using the client.

              A HomeDirectory example is /bucket_name/home/mydirectory .

              NOTE:
                 The HomeDirectory parameter is only used if HomeDirectoryType
                 is set to PATH .

          HomeDirectoryMappings -> (list)
              Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon
              EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user  and  how  you
              want to make them visible. You must specify the Entry and Target
              pair, where Entry shows how the path is made visible and  Target
              is  the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify
              a target, it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that  your
              Identity  and  Access  Management  (IAM) role provides access to
              paths in Target . This value can be set only when HomeDirectory-
              Type is set to LOGICAL .

              In  most  cases,  you  can use this value instead of the session
              policy to lock your user down to the designated  home  directory
              ("chroot "). To do this, you can set Entry to '/' and set Target
              to the HomeDirectory parameter value.

              (structure)
                 Represents an object that contains entries  and  targets  for
                 HomeDirectoryMappings .

                 The  following is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot
                 .
                     [ { "Entry": "/",  "Target":  "/bucket_name/home/mydirec-
                     tory" } ]

                 Entry -> (string)
                     Represents an entry for HomeDirectoryMappings .

                 Target -> (string)
                     Represents  the map target that is used in a HomeDirecto-
                     ryMapEntry .

                 Type -> (string)
                     Specifies the type of mapping. Set the type  to  FILE  if
                     you want the mapping to point to a file, or DIRECTORY for
                     the directory to point to a directory.

                     NOTE:
                        By default, home directory mappings have a Type of DI-
                        RECTORY  when you create a Transfer Family server. You
                        would need to explicitly set Type to FILE if you  want
                        a mapping to have a file target.

          HomeDirectoryType -> (string)
              The type of landing directory (folder) that you want your users'
              home directory to be when they log in to the server. If you  set
              it  to PATH , the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or
              Amazon EFS path as is in their file transfer  protocol  clients.
              If  you  set it to LOGICAL , you need to provide mappings in the
              HomeDirectoryMappings for how you want to make Amazon S3 or Ama-
              zon EFS paths visible to your users.

              NOTE:
                 If  HomeDirectoryType is LOGICAL , you must provide mappings,
                 using the HomeDirectoryMappings parameter. If, on  the  other
                 hand,  HomeDirectoryType  is  PATH  , you provide an absolute
                 path using the HomeDirectory parameter. You cannot have  both
                 HomeDirectory and HomeDirectoryMappings in your template.

          Policy -> (string)
              A  session  policy  for  your  user so that you can use the same
              Identity and Access Management (IAM) role across multiple users.
              This  policy  scopes  down  a user's access to portions of their
              Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this  policy
              include  ${Transfer:UserName}  , ${Transfer:HomeDirectory} , and
              ${Transfer:HomeBucket} .

          PosixProfile -> (structure)
              Specifies the full POSIX identity, including  user  ID  (Uid  ),
              group  ID (Gid ), and any secondary groups IDs (SecondaryGids ),
              that controls your users' access to  your  Amazon  Elastic  File
              System (Amazon EFS) file systems. The POSIX permissions that are
              set on files and directories in your file system  determine  the
              level  of access your users get when transferring files into and
              out of your Amazon EFS file systems.

              Uid -> (long)
                 The POSIX user ID used for all EFS operations by this user.

              Gid -> (long)
                 The POSIX group ID used for all EFS operations by this user.

              SecondaryGids -> (list)
                 The secondary POSIX group IDs used for all EFS operations  by
                 this user.

                 (long)

          Role -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Man-
              agement (IAM) role that controls your users' access to your Ama-
              zon  S3  bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The policies attached
              to this role determine the level of access that you want to pro-
              vide  your  users  when  transferring files into and out of your
              Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The IAM role  should
              also  contain a trust relationship that allows the server to ac-
              cess your resources when  servicing  your  users'  transfer  re-
              quests.

          SshPublicKeys -> (list)
              Specifies  the public key portion of the Secure Shell (SSH) keys
              stored for the described user.

              (structure)
                 Provides information about the public Secure Shell (SSH)  key
                 that  is  associated with a Transfer Family user for the spe-
                 cific file transfer protocol-enabled server (as identified by
                 ServerId  ).  The  information returned includes the date the
                 key was imported, the public key contents, and the public key
                 ID.  A user can store more than one SSH public key associated
                 with their user name on a specific server.

                 DateImported -> (timestamp)
                     Specifies the date that the public key was added  to  the
                     Transfer Family user.

                 SshPublicKeyBody -> (string)
                     Specifies  the content of the SSH public key as specified
                     by the PublicKeyId .

                     Transfer Family accepts RSA, ECDSA, and ED25519 keys.

                 SshPublicKeyId -> (string)
                     Specifies the SshPublicKeyId parameter contains the iden-
                     tifier of the public key.

          Tags -> (list)
              Specifies the key-value pairs for the user requested. Tag can be
              used to search for and group users for a variety of purposes.

              (structure)
                 Creates a key-value pair for a specific  resource.  Tags  are
                 metadata  that you can use to search for and group a resource
                 for various purposes. You can apply tags to  servers,  users,
                 and  roles. A tag key can take more than one value. For exam-
                 ple, to group servers for accounting purposes, you might cre-
                 ate a tag called Group and assign the values Research and Ac-
                 counting to that group.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The name assigned to the tag that you create.

                 Value -> (string)
                     Contains one or more values that you assigned to the  key
                     name you create.

          UserName -> (string)
              Specifies  the  name  of  the  user that was requested to be de-
              scribed. User names are used for authentication  purposes.  This
              is the string that will be used by your user when they log in to
              your server.
