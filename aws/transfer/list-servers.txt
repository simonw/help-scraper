LIST-SERVERS()                                                  LIST-SERVERS()



NAME
       list-servers -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  file  transfer protocol-enabled servers that are associated
       with your Amazon Web Services account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-servers is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: Servers

SYNOPSIS
            list-servers
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          When  you can get additional results from the ListServers operation,
          a NextToken parameter is returned in the output. In a following com-
          mand,  you  can  pass in the NextToken parameter to continue listing
          additional servers.

       Servers -> (list)
          An array of servers that were listed.

          (structure)
              Returns properties of a file  transfer  protocol-enabled  server
              that was specified.

              Arn -> (string)
                 Specifies  the unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a server
                 to be listed.

              Domain -> (string)
                 Specifies the domain of the storage system that is  used  for
                 file transfers.

              IdentityProviderType -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  mode  of authentication for a server. The de-
                 fault value is SERVICE_MANAGED , which allows  you  to  store
                 and  access  user  credentials within the Amazon Web Services
                 Transfer Family service.

                 Use AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE to provide access to Active  Direc-
                 tory  groups  in Amazon Web Services Managed Active Directory
                 or Microsoft Active Directory in your on-premises environment
                 or  in  Amazon  Web Services using AD Connectors. This option
                 also requires you to provide a Directory ID using the Identi-
                 tyProviderDetails parameter.

                 Use  the  API_GATEWAY  value  to  integrate  with an identity
                 provider of your choosing. The API_GATEWAY  setting  requires
                 you  to  provide  an API Gateway endpoint URL to call for au-
                 thentication using the IdentityProviderDetails parameter.

                 Use the AWS_LAMBDA value to directly use a Lambda function as
                 your  identity  provider.  If you choose this value, you must
                 specify the ARN for the lambda function in the  Function  pa-
                 rameter for the IdentityProviderDetails data type.

              EndpointType -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  type of VPC endpoint that your server is con-
                 nected to. If your server is connected  to  a  VPC  endpoint,
                 your server isn't accessible over the public internet.

              LoggingRole -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web
                 Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) role  that  al-
                 lows a server to turn on Amazon CloudWatch logging for Amazon
                 S3 or Amazon EFS events.  When  set,  user  activity  can  be
                 viewed in your CloudWatch logs.

              ServerId -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  unique  system  assigned  identifier  for the
                 servers that were listed.

              State -> (string)
                 Specifies the condition of a server for the server  that  was
                 described.  A  value  of ONLINE indicates that the server can
                 accept jobs and transfer files.  A  State  value  of  OFFLINE
                 means  that  the  server  cannot perform file transfer opera-
                 tions.

                 The states of STARTING and STOPPING indicate that the  server
                 is  in  an  intermediate  state, either not fully able to re-
                 spond, or not fully offline. The values  of  START_FAILED  or
                 STOP_FAILED can indicate an error condition.

              UserCount -> (integer)
                 Specifies  the  number of users that are assigned to a server
                 you specified with the ServerId .
