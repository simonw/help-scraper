DESCRIBE-SERVER()                                            DESCRIBE-SERVER()



NAME
       describe-server -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  a  file transfer protocol-enabled server that you specify by
       passing the ServerId parameter.

       The response contains a description of a server's properties. When  you
       set  EndpointType to VPC, the response will contain the EndpointDetails
       .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-server
          --server-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --server-id (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier for a server.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Server -> (structure)
          An array containing the properties of a server with the ServerID you
          specified.

          Arn -> (string)
              Specifies the unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the server.

          Certificate -> (string)
              Specifies  the ARN of the Amazon Web ServicesCertificate Manager
              (ACM) certificate. Required when Protocols is set to FTPS .

          ProtocolDetails -> (structure)
              The protocol settings that are configured for your server.

              Use the PassiveIp parameter to indicate passive  mode.  Enter  a
              single dotted-quad IPv4 address, such as the external IP address
              of a firewall, router, or load balancer.

              PassiveIp -> (string)
                 Indicates passive mode, for FTP and FTPS protocols.  Enter  a
                 single  dotted-quad IPv4 address, such as the external IP ad-
                 dress of a firewall, router, or load balancer. For example:

                     ``
                     aws  transfer   update-server   --protocol-details   Pas-
                     siveIp=*0.0.0.0* ``

                 Replace `` 0.0.0.0 `` in the example above with the actual IP
                 address you want to use.

                 NOTE:
                     If you change the PassiveIp value, you must stop and then
                     restart  your  Transfer server for the change to take ef-
                     fect. For details on using Passive IP (PASV) in a NAT en-
                     vironment,  see  Configuring  your  FTPS  server behind a
                     firewall or NAT with Amazon Web Services Transfer  Family
                     .

              TlsSessionResumptionMode -> (string)
                 A  property used with Transfer servers that use the FTPS pro-
                 tocol. TLS Session Resumption provides a mechanism to  resume
                 or share a negotiated secret key between the control and data
                 connection for an FTPS session. TlsSessionResumptionMode  de-
                 termines whether or not the server resumes recent, negotiated
                 sessions through a unique session ID. This property is avail-
                 able during CreateServer and UpdateServer calls. If a TlsSes-
                 sionResumptionMode value  is  not  specified  during  Create-
                 Server, it is set to ENFORCED by default.

                 o DISABLED  : the server does not process TLS session resump-
                   tion client requests and creates a new TLS session for each
                   request.

                 o ENABLED : the server processes and accepts clients that are
                   performing TLS session resumption. The server  doesn't  re-
                   ject  client  data  connections that do not perform the TLS
                   session resumption client processing.

                 o ENFORCED : the server processes and  accepts  clients  that
                   are  performing  TLS session resumption. The server rejects
                   client data connections that do not perform the TLS session
                   resumption  client  processing. Before you set the value to
                   ENFORCED , test your clients.

                 NOTE:
                     Not all FTPS clients perform TLS session resumption.  So,
                     if you choose to enforce TLS session resumption, you pre-
                     vent any connections from FTPS clients that don't perform
                     the protocol negotiation. To determine whether or not you
                     can use  the  ENFORCED  value,  you  need  to  test  your
                     clients.

          Domain -> (string)
              Specifies the domain of the storage system that is used for file
              transfers.

          EndpointDetails -> (structure)
              The virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that are  con-
              figured for your server. When you host your endpoint within your
              VPC, you can make it accessible only to  resources  within  your
              VPC, or you can attach Elastic IP addresses and make it accessi-
              ble to clients over the internet. Your  VPC's  default  security
              groups are automatically assigned to your endpoint.

              AddressAllocationIds -> (list)
                 A  list of address allocation IDs that are required to attach
                 an Elastic IP address to your server's endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to
                     VPC and it is only valid in the UpdateServer API.

                 (string)

              SubnetIds -> (list)
                 A  list  of  subnet IDs that are required to host your server
                 endpoint in your VPC.

                 NOTE:
                     This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to
                     VPC .

                 (string)

              VpcEndpointId -> (string)
                 The ID of the VPC endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to
                     VPC_ENDPOINT .

                     For           more            information,            see
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vpc-endpoint.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The VPC ID of the VPC in which a server's  endpoint  will  be
                 hosted.

                 NOTE:
                     This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to
                     VPC .

              SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                 A list of security groups IDs that are available to attach to
                 your server's endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to
                     VPC .

                     You  can  edit  the  SecurityGroupIds  property  in   the
                     UpdateServer  API  only if you are changing the Endpoint-
                     Type from PUBLIC or VPC_ENDPOINT to VPC . To change secu-
                     rity  groups  associated  with your server's VPC endpoint
                     after creation, use the Amazon EC2 ModifyVpcEndpoint API.

                 (string)

          EndpointType -> (string)
              Defines the type of endpoint that your server is  connected  to.
              If your server is connected to a VPC endpoint, your server isn't
              accessible over the public internet.

          HostKeyFingerprint -> (string)
              Specifies the Base64-encoded SHA256 fingerprint of the  server's
              host key. This value is equivalent to the output of the ssh-key-
              gen -l -f my-new-server-key command.

          IdentityProviderDetails -> (structure)
              Specifies information to call a customer-supplied authentication
              API.  This  field is not populated when the IdentityProviderType
              of a server is AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE or SERVICE_MANAGED .

              Url -> (string)
                 Provides the location of the service endpoint used to authen-
                 ticate users.

              InvocationRole -> (string)
                 Provides  the type of InvocationRole used to authenticate the
                 user account.

              DirectoryId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the Amazon Web Services  Directory  Service
                 directory that you want to stop sharing.

              Function -> (string)
                 The  ARN  for  a  lambda  function  to  use  for the Identity
                 provider.

          IdentityProviderType -> (string)
              Specifies the mode of authentication for a server.  The  default
              value  is SERVICE_MANAGED , which allows you to store and access
              user credentials within the Amazon Web Services Transfer  Family
              service.

              Use  AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE to provide access to Active Directory
              groups in Amazon Web Services Managed Active Directory or Micro-
              soft Active Directory in your on-premises environment or in Ama-
              zon Web Services using AD Connectors. This option also  requires
              you  to provide a Directory ID using the IdentityProviderDetails
              parameter.

              Use the API_GATEWAY value to integrate with an identity provider
              of  your  choosing. The API_GATEWAY setting requires you to pro-
              vide an API Gateway endpoint URL to call for authentication  us-
              ing the IdentityProviderDetails parameter.

              Use  the  AWS_LAMBDA  value to directly use a Lambda function as
              your identity provider. If you choose this value, you must spec-
              ify  the  ARN  for the lambda function in the Function parameter
              for the IdentityProviderDetails data type.

          LoggingRole -> (string)
              Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web  Ser-
              vices  Identity  and  Access Management (IAM) role that allows a
              server to turn on Amazon CloudWatch logging  for  Amazon  S3  or
              Amazon EFS events. When set, user activity can be viewed in your
              CloudWatch logs.

          Protocols -> (list)
              Specifies the file transfer protocol  or  protocols  over  which
              your  file transfer protocol client can connect to your server's
              endpoint. The available protocols are:

              o SFTP (Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol): File  trans-
                fer over SSH

              o FTPS  (File  Transfer Protocol Secure): File transfer with TLS
                encryption

              o FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Unencrypted file transfer

              (string)

          SecurityPolicyName -> (string)
              Specifies the name of the security policy that  is  attached  to
              the server.

          ServerId -> (string)
              Specifies  the  unique  system-assigned  identifier for a server
              that you instantiate.

          State -> (string)
              Specifies the condition of a server for the server that was  de-
              scribed.  A value of ONLINE indicates that the server can accept
              jobs and transfer files. A State value of OFFLINE means that the
              server cannot perform file transfer operations.

              The  states of STARTING and STOPPING indicate that the server is
              in an intermediate state, either not fully able to  respond,  or
              not fully offline. The values of START_FAILED or STOP_FAILED can
              indicate an error condition.

          Tags -> (list)
              Specifies the key-value pairs that you can use to search for and
              group  servers  that  were  assigned  to the server that was de-
              scribed.

              (structure)
                 Creates a key-value pair for a specific  resource.  Tags  are
                 metadata  that you can use to search for and group a resource
                 for various purposes. You can apply tags to  servers,  users,
                 and  roles. A tag key can take more than one value. For exam-
                 ple, to group servers for accounting purposes, you might cre-
                 ate a tag called Group and assign the values Research and Ac-
                 counting to that group.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The name assigned to the tag that you create.

                 Value -> (string)
                     Contains one or more values that you assigned to the  key
                     name you create.

          UserCount -> (integer)
              Specifies  the number of users that are assigned to a server you
              specified with the ServerId .

          WorkflowDetails -> (structure)
              Specifies the workflow ID for the workflow to assign and the ex-
              ecution role used for executing the workflow.

              OnUpload -> (list)
                 A trigger that starts a workflow: the workflow begins to exe-
                 cute after a file is uploaded.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies the workflow ID for the workflow to assign  and
                     the execution role used for executing the workflow.

                     WorkflowId -> (string)
                        A unique identifier for the workflow.

                     ExecutionRole -> (string)
                        Includes  the  necessary  permissions for S3, EFS, and
                        Lambda operations that Transfer can  assume,  so  that
                        all  workflow  steps  can  operate on the required re-
                        sources
