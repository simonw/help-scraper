LIST-EXECUTIONS()                                            LIST-EXECUTIONS()



NAME
       list-executions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all executions for the specified workflow.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-executions
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          --workflow-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies the aximum number of executions to return.

       --next-token (string)
              ListExecutions  returns  the  NextToken parameter in the output.
              You can then pass the NextToken parameter in a  subsequent  com-
              mand to continue listing additional executions.

          This  is useful for pagination, for instance. If you have 100 execu-
          tions for a workflow, you might only want to list first 10.  If  so,
          callthe API by specifing the max-results :
              aws transfer list-executions --max-results 10

          This  returns  details  for  the first 10 executions, as well as the
          pointer (NextToken ) to the eleventh execution. You can now call the
          API again, suppling the NextToken value you received:
              aws   transfer  list-executions  --max-results  10  --next-token
              $somePointerReturnedFromPreviousListResult

          This call returns the next 10 executions, the 11th through the 20th.
          You  can  then  repeat the call until the details for all 100 execu-
          tions have been returned.

       --workflow-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the workflow.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          ListExecutions  returns  the  NextToken parameter in the output. You
          can then pass the NextToken parameter in  a  subsequent  command  to
          continue listing additional executions.

       WorkflowId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the workflow.

       Executions -> (list)
          Returns the details for each execution.

          o NextToken : returned from a call to several APIs, you can use pass
            it to a subsequent command to continue listing  additional  execu-
            tions.

          o StartTime : timestamp indicating when the execution began.

          o Executions : details of the execution, including the execution ID,
            initial file location, and Service metadata.

          o Status : one of the following values: IN_PROGRESS  ,  COMPLETED  ,
            EXCEPTION , HANDLING_EXEPTION .

          (structure)
              Returns properties of the execution that is specified.

              ExecutionId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the execution of a workflow.

              InitialFileLocation -> (structure)
                 A  structure  that  describes the Amazon S3 or EFS file loca-
                 tion. This is the file location when the execution begins: if
                 the  file is being copied, this is the initial (as opposed to
                 destination) file location.

                 S3FileLocation -> (structure)
                     Specifies the S3 details for the file being used, such as
                     bucket, Etag, and so forth.

                     Bucket -> (string)
                        Specifies  the  S3 bucket that contains the file being
                        used.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The name assigned to the file when it was  created  in
                        S3. You use the object key to retrieve the object.

                     VersionId -> (string)
                        Specifies the file version.

                     Etag -> (string)
                        The  entity  tag is a hash of the object. The ETag re-
                        flects changes only to the contents of an object,  not
                        its metadata.

                 EfsFileLocation -> (structure)
                     Specifies the Amazon EFS ID and the path for the file be-
                     ing used.

                     FileSystemId -> (string)
                        The ID of the file system, assigned by Amazon EFS.

                     Path -> (string)
                        The pathname for the folder being used by a workflow.

              ServiceMetadata -> (structure)
                 A container object for the session details associated with  a
                 workflow.

                 UserDetails -> (structure)
                     The  Server  ID  (ServerId ), Session ID (SessionId ) and
                     user (UserName ) make up the UserDetails .

                     UserName -> (string)
                        A unique string that identifies a user account associ-
                        ated with a server.

                     ServerId -> (string)
                        The  system-assigned  unique identifier for a Transfer
                        server instance.

                     SessionId -> (string)
                        The system-assigned unique identifier  for  a  session
