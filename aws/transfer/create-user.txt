CREATE-USER()                                                    CREATE-USER()



NAME
       create-user -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a user and associates them with an existing file transfer pro-
       tocol-enabled server. You can only  create  and  associate  users  with
       servers that have the IdentityProviderType set to SERVICE_MANAGED . Us-
       ing parameters for CreateUser , you can specify the user name, set  the
       home directory, store the user's public key, and assign the user's Ama-
       zon Web Services Identity and Access Management  (IAM)  role.  You  can
       also  optionally  add  a  session policy, and assign metadata with tags
       that can be used to group and search for users.

OPTIONS
       --home-directory (string)
          The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log  in  to  the
          server using the client.

          A HomeDirectory example is /bucket_name/home/mydirectory .

       --home-directory-type (string)
          The type of landing directory (folder) you want your users' home di-
          rectory to be when they log into the server. If you set it to PATH ,
          the  user  will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or EFS paths as is
          in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it LOGICAL , you
          need  to  provide  mappings in the HomeDirectoryMappings for how you
          want to make Amazon S3 or EFS paths visible to your users.

          Possible values:

          o PATH

          o LOGICAL

       --home-directory-mappings (list)
          Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS
          paths  and  keys  should be visible to your user and how you want to
          make them visible. You must specify the Entry and Target pair, where
          Entry  shows  how  the path is made visible and Target is the actual
          Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a  target,  it  is
          displayed  as is. You also must ensure that your Amazon Web Services
          Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access  to  paths
          in Target . This value can only be set when HomeDirectoryType is set
          to LOGICAL .

          The following is an Entry and Target pair example.
              [ { "Entry": "/directory1",  "Target":  "/bucket_name/home/mydi-
              rectory" } ]

          In  most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy
          to lock your user down to the designated home directory ("chroot ").
          To  do this, you can set Entry to / and set Target to the HomeDirec-
          tory parameter value.

          The following is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot .
              [ { "Entry:": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ]

          NOTE:
              If the target of a logical directory entry  does  not  exist  in
              Amazon S3 or EFS, the entry is ignored. As a workaround, you can
              use the Amazon S3 API or EFS API to create  0  byte  objects  as
              place  holders  for  your  directory.  If using the CLI, use the
              s3api or efsapi call instead of s3 or efs so  you  can  use  the
              put-object  operation.  For  example, you use the following: aws
              s3api put-object --bucket  bucketname  --key  path/to/folder/  .
              Make  sure that the end of the key name ends in a / for it to be
              considered a folder.

          (structure)
              Represents an object that contains entries and targets for Home-
              DirectoryMappings .

              The following is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot .
                 [  { "Entry:": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory"
                 } ]

              NOTE:
                 If the target of a logical directory entry does not exist  in
                 Amazon  S3 or EFS, the entry is ignored. As a workaround, you
                 can use the Amazon S3 API or EFS API to create 0 byte objects
                 as  place  holders  for your directory. If using the CLI, use
                 the s3api or efsapi call instead of s3 or efs so you can  use
                 the put-object operation. For example, you use the following:
                 aws    s3api    put-object    --bucket    bucketname    --key
                 path/to/folder/ . Make sure that the end of the key name ends
                 in a / for it to be considered a folder.

              Entry -> (string)
                 Represents an entry for HomeDirectoryMappings .

              Target -> (string)
                 Represents the map target that  is  used  in  a  HomeDirecto-
                 rymapEntry .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Entry=string,Target=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Entry": "string",
              "Target": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --policy (string)
          A session policy for your user so that you can use the same IAM role
          across multiple users. This policy scopes down user access  to  por-
          tions  of  their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside
          this policy include ${Transfer:UserName} , ${Transfer:HomeDirectory}
          , and ${Transfer:HomeBucket} .

          NOTE:
              This  only  applies  when the domain of ServerId is S3. EFS does
              not use session policies.

              For session policies, Amazon Web Services Transfer Family stores
              the  policy  as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name
              (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass
              it in the Policy argument.

              For an example of a session policy, see Example session policy .

              For  more information, see AssumeRole in the Amazon Web Services
              Security Token Service API Reference .

       --posix-profile (structure)
          Specifies the full POSIX identity, including user ID (Uid  ),  group
          ID  (Gid ), and any secondary groups IDs (SecondaryGids ), that con-
          trols your users' access to your Amazon EFS file systems. The  POSIX
          permissions  that are set on files and directories in Amazon EFS de-
          termine the level of access your users get when  transferring  files
          into and out of your Amazon EFS file systems.

          Uid -> (long)
              The POSIX user ID used for all EFS operations by this user.

          Gid -> (long)
              The POSIX group ID used for all EFS operations by this user.

          SecondaryGids -> (list)
              The  secondary  POSIX  group  IDs used for all EFS operations by
              this user.

              (long)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Uid=long,Gid=long,SecondaryGids=long,long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Uid": long,
            "Gid": long,
            "SecondaryGids": [long, ...]
          }

       --role (string)
          Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role  that  con-
          trols  your  users' access to your Amazon S3 bucket or EFS file sys-
          tem. The policies attached to this role determine the level  of  ac-
          cess  that  you  want  to provide your users when transferring files
          into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or EFS file  system.  The  IAM
          role should also contain a trust relationship that allows the server
          to access your resources when servicing  your  users'  transfer  re-
          quests.

       --server-id (string)
          A  system-assigned  unique identifier for a server instance. This is
          the specific server that you added your user to.

       --ssh-public-key-body (string)
          The public portion of the Secure Shell (SSH) key used  to  authenti-
          cate the user to the server.

          NOTE:
              Currently, Transfer Family does not accept elliptical curve keys
              (keys beginning with ecdsa ).

       --tags (list)
          Key-value pairs that can be used to group and search for users. Tags
          are metadata attached to users for any purpose.

          (structure)
              Creates a key-value pair for a specific resource. Tags are meta-
              data that you can use to search for and  group  a  resource  for
              various  purposes.  You  can  apply  tags to servers, users, and
              roles. A tag key can take more than one value. For  example,  to
              group  servers  for  accounting purposes, you might create a tag
              called Group and assign the values Research  and  Accounting  to
              that group.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name assigned to the tag that you create.

              Value -> (string)
                 Contains one or more values that you assigned to the key name
                 you create.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --user-name (string)
          A unique string that identifies a user  and  is  associated  with  a
          ServerId  .  This  user name must be a minimum of 3 and a maximum of
          100 characters long. The following are valid characters:  a-z,  A-Z,
          0-9,  underscore  '_',  hyphen '-', period '.', and at sign '@'. The
          user name can't start with a hyphen, period, or at sign.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ServerId -> (string)
          The ID of the server that the user is attached to.

       UserName -> (string)
          A unique string that identifies a user  account  associated  with  a
          server.
