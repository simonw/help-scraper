NAME
       describe-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       You  can use DescribeExecution to check the details of the execution of
       the specified workflow.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-execution
          --execution-id <value>
          --workflow-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --execution-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the execution of a workflow.

       --workflow-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the workflow.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       WorkflowId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the workflow.

       Execution -> (structure)
          The structure that contains the details of the workflow' execution.

          ExecutionId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the execution of a workflow.

          InitialFileLocation -> (structure)
              A  structure  that describes the Amazon S3 or EFS file location.
              This is the file location when the execution begins: if the file
              is being copied, this is the initial (as opposed to destination)
              file location.

              S3FileLocation -> (structure)
                 Specifies the S3 details for the file  being  used,  such  as
                 bucket, Etag, and so forth.

                 Bucket -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  S3  bucket  that  contains the file being
                     used.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The name assigned to the file when it was created in  S3.

                 Etag -> (string)
                     The entity tag is a hash of the object. The ETag reflects
                     changes only to the contents of an object, not its  meta-
                     data.

              EfsFileLocation -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the  Amazon EFS ID and the path for the file being
                 used.

                     A unique string that identifies a user account associated
                     with a server.

                 ServerId -> (string)
                     The  system-assigned  unique  identifier  for  a Transfer
                     server instance.

                 SessionId -> (string)
                     The system-assigned unique identifier for a session  that

                 lows a server to turn on Amazon CloudWatch logging for Amazon
                 S3 or Amazon EFS events.  When  set,  user  activity  can  be
                 viewed in your CloudWatch logs.

              LogGroupName -> (string)
                 The  name  of the CloudWatch logging group for the Amazon Web
