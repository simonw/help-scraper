NAME
       describe-scaling-plan-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the scalable resources in the specified scaling plan.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-scaling-plan-resources  is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: ScalingPlanResources

SYNOPSIS
            describe-scaling-plan-resources
          --scaling-plan-name <value>
          --scaling-plan-version <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --scaling-plan-name (string)
          The name of the scaling plan.

       --scaling-plan-version (long)
          The version number of the scaling plan. Currently,  the  only  valid
          value is 1 .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The  following describe-scaling-plan-resources example displays details
       about the single scalable resource (an Auto Scaling group) that is  as-
       sociated with the specified scaling plan.

                 (structure)
                     Represents a scaling policy.

                     PolicyName -> (string)

                            A predefined metric. You can specify either a pre-
                            defined metric or a customized metric.

                            PredefinedScalingMetricType -> (string)
                               The metric type.  The  ALBRequestCountPerTarget
                               metric   type  applies  only  to  Auto  Scaling
                               groups, Spot Fleet requests, and ECS services.

                            ResourceLabel -> (string)
                               Identifies the  resource  associated  with  the
                               metric type. You can't specify a resource label
                               unless the metric type  is  ALBRequestCountPer-
                               Target  and  there is a target group for an Ap-
                               plication Load Balancer attached  to  the  Auto
                               Scaling  group, Spot Fleet request, or ECS ser-
                               vice.

                               You create the resource label by appending  the
                               final  portion of the load balancer ARN and the
                               final portion of the target group  ARN  into  a
                               single value, separated by a forward slash (/).
                               The       format       is        app/<load-bal-
                               ancer-name>/<load-balancer-id>/target-
                               group/<target-group-name>/<target-group-id>,
                               where:

                               o app/<load-balancer-name>/<load-balancer-id>
                                 is the final portion of the load balancer ARN

                               o targetgroup/<target-group-name>/<tar-
                                 get-group-id>  is  the  final  portion of the
                                 target group ARN.

                               This  is  an  example:   app/EC2Co-EcsEl-1TKLT-
                               MITMM0EO/f37c06a68c1748aa/targetgroup/EC2Co-De-
                               fau-LDNM7Q3ZH1ZN/6d4ea56ca2d6a18d.

                               To find the ARN for an  Application  Load  Bal-
                               ancer, use the DescribeLoadBalancers API opera-
                               tion. To find the ARN for the target group, use
                               the DescribeTargetGroups API operation.

                        CustomizedScalingMetricSpecification -> (structure)
                            A customized metric. You can specify either a pre-
                            defined metric or a customized metric.

                            MetricName -> (string)
                               The name of the metric.

                            Namespace -> (string)
                               The namespace of the metric.

                            Dimensions -> (list)
                               The dimensions of the metric.

                               Conditional: If you published your metric  with
                               dimensions,  you  must  specify the same dimen-
                               sions in your customized scaling metric  speci-
                               fication.

                               (structure)
                                   Represents  a  dimension  for  a customized
                                   metric.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the dimension.

                                   Value -> (string)
                                      The value of the dimension.

                            Statistic -> (string)
                               The statistic of the metric.

                            Unit -> (string)
                               The unit of the metric.

                        TargetValue -> (double)
                            The target value for  the  metric.  Although  this
                            property  accepts numbers of type Double, it won't
                            accept values that are either  too  small  or  too
                            large.  Values  must  be in the range of -2^360 to
                            2^360.

                        DisableScaleIn -> (boolean)
                            Indicates whether scale in by the target  tracking
                            scaling policy is disabled. If the value is true ,
                            scale in is disabled and the target tracking scal-
                            ing  policy doesn't remove capacity from the scal-
                            able resource. Otherwise, scale in is enabled  and
                            the  target tracking scaling policy can remove ca-
                            pacity from the scalable resource.

                            The default value is false .

                        ScaleOutCooldown -> (integer)
                            The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a pre-
                            vious  scale-out  activity  to  take  effect. This
                            property is not used if the scalable  resource  is
                            an Auto Scaling group.

                            With the scale-out cooldown period , the intention
                            is to continuously  (but  not  excessively)  scale
                            out.  After  Auto  Scaling successfully scales out
                            using a target tracking scaling policy, it  starts
                            to calculate the cooldown time. The scaling policy
                            won't increase the desired capacity  again  unless
                            either  a  larger  scale  out  is triggered or the
                            cooldown period ends.

                        ScaleInCooldown -> (integer)
                            The amount of time, in seconds, after  a  scale-in
                            activity  completes before another scale-in activ-
                            ity can start. This property is not  used  if  the
                            scalable resource is an Auto Scaling group.

                            With  the scale-in cooldown period , the intention
                            is to scale in conservatively to protect your  ap-
                            plications  availability,  so  scale-in activities
                            are blocked until the cooldown period has expired.
                            However, if another alarm triggers a scale-out ac-

                            Scaling scales out the target immediately. In this
                            case,  the  scale-in  cooldown  period  stops  and
                            doesn't complete.

                        EstimatedInstanceWarmup -> (integer)
                            The  estimated  time,  in  seconds,  until a newly
                            launched instance can contribute to the CloudWatch
                            metrics.  This  value is used only if the resource
                            is an Auto Scaling group.

              ScalingStatusCode -> (string)
                 The scaling status of the resource.

                 o Active - The scaling configuration is active.

                 o Inactive - The scaling configuration is not active  because
                   the scaling plan is being created or the scaling configura-
                   tion could not be applied. Check  the  status  message  for
                   more information.

                 o PartiallyActive  -  The  scaling configuration is partially
                   active because the scaling plan is being created or deleted
                   or  the  scaling  configuration could not be fully applied.
                   Check the status message for more information.

              ScalingStatusMessage -> (string)
                 A simple message about the current scaling status of the  re-
                 source.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token  required  to  get the next set of results. This value is
          null if there are no more results to return.
