          The scaling instructions.

          For more information, see ScalingInstruction in the AWS Auto Scaling
          API Reference .

          (structure)
              Describes  a  scaling  instruction  for a scalable resource in a
              scaling plan. Each scaling instruction applies to one resource.

              AWS Auto Scaling creates target tracking scaling policies  based
              on  the  scaling  instructions. Target tracking scaling policies
              adjust the capacity of your scalable  resource  as  required  to
              maintain resource utilization at the target value that you spec-
              ified.

              AWS Auto Scaling also configures  predictive  scaling  for  your
              Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups using a subset of parameters, in-
              cluding the load metric, the scaling metric,  the  target  value
              for  the  scaling  metric, the predictive scaling mode (forecast
              and scale or forecast only), and the desired behavior  when  the
              forecast  capacity exceeds the maximum capacity of the resource.
              With predictive scaling, AWS Auto  Scaling  generates  forecasts
              with  traffic  predictions  for the two days ahead and schedules
              scaling actions that proactively add and remove resource  capac-
              ity to match the forecast.

              WARNING:
                 We  recommend waiting a minimum of 24 hours after creating an
                 Auto Scaling group to configure predictive scaling. At  mini-
                 mum,  there must be 24 hours of historical data to generate a
                 forecast. For more information, see Best  Practices  for  AWS
                 Auto Scaling in the AWS Auto Scaling User Guide .

              MinCapacity -> (integer)
                 The minimum capacity of the resource.

              MaxCapacity -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  capacity of the resource. The exception to this
                 upper limit is if you specify a non-default setting for  Pre-
                 dictiveScalingMaxCapacityBehavior .

              TargetTrackingConfigurations -> (list)
                 The  target tracking configurations (up to 10). Each of these
                 structures must specify a unique scaling metric and a  target
                 value for the metric.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a target tracking configuration to use with AWS
                     Auto Scaling. Used with  ScalingInstruction and  Scaling-
                     Policy .

                     PredefinedScalingMetricSpecification -> (structure)
                        A  predefined  metric. You can specify either a prede-
                        fined metric or a customized metric.

                        PredefinedScalingMetricType -> (string)
                            The metric type. The ALBRequestCountPerTarget met-
                            ric type applies only to Auto Scaling groups, Spot
                            Fleet requests, and ECS services.

                        ResourceLabel -> (string)
                            Identifies the resource associated with the metric
                            type.  You  can't  specify a resource label unless
                            the metric type  is  ALBRequestCountPerTarget  and
                            there  is  a  target group for an Application Load
                            Balancer attached to the Auto Scaling group,  Spot
                            Fleet request, or ECS service.

                            You create the resource label by appending the fi-
                            nal portion of the load balancer ARN and the final
                            portion  of  the  target  group  ARN into a single
                            value, separated by a forward slash (/). The  for-
                            mat     is     app/<load-balancer-name>/<load-bal-
                            ancer-id>/targetgroup/<target-group-name>/<tar-
                            get-group-id>, where:

                            o app/<load-balancer-name>/<load-balancer-id>   is
                              the final portion of the load balancer ARN

                            o targetgroup/<target-group-name>/<tar-
                              get-group-id> is the final portion of the target
                              group ARN.

                            This   is   an   example:   app/EC2Co-EcsEl-1TKLT-
                            MITMM0EO/f37c06a68c1748aa/targetgroup/EC2Co-De-
                            fau-LDNM7Q3ZH1ZN/6d4ea56ca2d6a18d.

                            To find the ARN for an Application Load  Balancer,
                            use  the  DescribeLoadBalancers  API operation. To
                            find  the  ARN  for  the  target  group,  use  the
                            DescribeTargetGroups API operation.

                     CustomizedScalingMetricSpecification -> (structure)
                        A  customized  metric. You can specify either a prede-
                        fined metric or a customized metric.

                        MetricName -> (string)
                            The name of the metric.

                        Namespace -> (string)
                            The namespace of the metric.

                        Dimensions -> (list)
                            The dimensions of the metric.

                            Conditional: If you published your metric with di-
                            mensions,  you must specify the same dimensions in
                            your customized scaling metric specification.

                            (structure)
                               Represents a dimension for a customized metric.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the dimension.

                               Value -> (string)
                                   The value of the dimension.

                        Statistic -> (string)
                            The statistic of the metric.

                        Unit -> (string)
                            The unit of the metric.

                     TargetValue -> (double)
                        The target value for the metric. Although  this  prop-
                        erty  accepts  numbers of type Double, it won't accept
                        values that are either too small or too large.  Values
                        must be in the range of -2^360 to 2^360.

                     DisableScaleIn -> (boolean)
                        Indicates  whether  scale  in  by  the target tracking
                        scaling policy is disabled. If the  value  is  true  ,
                        scale  in  is disabled and the target tracking scaling
                        policy doesn't remove capacity from the  scalable  re-
                        source.  Otherwise, scale in is enabled and the target
                        tracking scaling policy can remove capacity  from  the
                        scalable resource.

                        The default value is false .

                     ScaleOutCooldown -> (integer)
                        The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a previous
                        scale-out activity to take effect.  This  property  is
                        not  used  if the scalable resource is an Auto Scaling
                        group.

                        With the scale-out cooldown period , the intention  is
                        to continuously (but not excessively) scale out. After
                        Auto Scaling successfully scales out  using  a  target
                        tracking  scaling  policy,  it starts to calculate the
                        cooldown time. The scaling policy won't  increase  the
                        desired  capacity  again  unless either a larger scale
                        out is triggered or the cooldown period ends.

                     ScaleInCooldown -> (integer)
                        The amount of time, in seconds, after a  scale-in  ac-
                        tivity  completes before another scale-in activity can
                        start. This property is not used if the  scalable  re-
                        source is an Auto Scaling group.

                        With  the  scale-in cooldown period , the intention is
                        to scale in conservatively to  protect  your  applica-
                        tions availability, so scale-in activities are blocked
                        until the cooldown period has expired. However, if an-
                        other  alarm  triggers a scale-out activity during the
                        scale-in cooldown period, Auto Scaling scales out  the
                        target   immediately.   In  this  case,  the  scale-in
                        cooldown period stops and doesn't complete.

                     EstimatedInstanceWarmup -> (integer)
                        The estimated time, in seconds, until a newly launched
                        instance  can  contribute  to  the CloudWatch metrics.
                        This value is used only if the  resource  is  an  Auto
                        Scaling group.

              PredefinedLoadMetricSpecification -> (structure)
                 The  predefined  load  metric  to use for predictive scaling.
                 This parameter or a CustomizedLoadMetricSpecification is  re-
                 quired  when  configuring  predictive  scaling, and cannot be
                 used otherwise.

                 PredefinedLoadMetricType -> (string)
                     The metric type.

                 ResourceLabel -> (string)
                     Identifies the resource associated with the metric  type.
                     You can't specify a resource label unless the metric type
                     is ALBTargetGroupRequestCount and there is a target group
                     for  an  Application  Load  Balancer attached to the Auto
                     Scaling group.

                     You create the resource label by appending the final por-
                     tion  of  the  load balancer ARN and the final portion of
                     the target group ARN into a single value, separated by  a
                     forward   slash   (/).   The   format  is  app/<load-bal-
                     ancer-name>/<load-balancer-id>/targetgroup/<tar-
                     get-group-name>/<target-group-id>, where:

                     o app/<load-balancer-name>/<load-balancer-id>  is the fi-
                       nal portion of the load balancer ARN

                     o targetgroup/<target-group-name>/<target-group-id>    is
                       the final portion of the target group ARN.

                     This     is     an     example:    app/EC2Co-EcsEl-1TKLT-
                     MITMM0EO/f37c06a68c1748aa/targetgroup/EC2Co-De-
                     fau-LDNM7Q3ZH1ZN/6d4ea56ca2d6a18d.

                     To find the ARN for an Application Load Balancer, use the
                     DescribeLoadBalancers API operation. To find the ARN  for
                     the target group, use the DescribeTargetGroups API opera-
                     tion.

              CustomizedLoadMetricSpecification -> (structure)
                 The customized load metric to  use  for  predictive  scaling.
                 This  parameter or a PredefinedLoadMetricSpecification is re-
                 quired when configuring predictive  scaling,  and  cannot  be
                 used otherwise.

                 MetricName -> (string)
                     The name of the metric.

                 Namespace -> (string)
                     The namespace of the metric.

                 Dimensions -> (list)
                     The dimensions of the metric.

                     Conditional:  If  you  published  your metric with dimen-
                     sions, you must specify the same dimensions in your  cus-
                     tomized load metric specification.

                     (structure)
                        Represents a dimension for a customized metric.

                        Name -> (string)
                            The name of the dimension.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value of the dimension.

                 Statistic -> (string)
                     The  statistic of the metric. The only valid value is Sum
                     .

                 Unit -> (string)
                     The unit of the metric.

              ScheduledActionBufferTime -> (integer)
                 The amount of time, in seconds, to buffer  the  run  time  of
                 scheduled  scaling  actions when scaling out. For example, if
                 the forecast says to add capacity at 10:00 AM, and the buffer
                 time  is  5  minutes,  then the run time of the corresponding
                 scheduled scaling action will be 9:55 AM. The intention is to
                 give  resources  time  to be provisioned. For example, it can
                 take a few minutes to launch  an  EC2  instance.  The  actual
                 amount  of  time required depends on several factors, such as
                 the size of  the  instance  and  whether  there  are  startup
                 scripts to complete.

                 The value must be less than the forecast interval duration of
                 3600 seconds (60 minutes). The default is 300 seconds.

                 Only valid when configuring predictive scaling.

              PredictiveScalingMaxCapacityBehavior -> (string)
                 Defines the behavior that should be applied if  the  forecast
                 capacity approaches or exceeds the maximum capacity specified
                 for the resource. The default value  is  SetForecastCapacity-
                 ToMaxCapacity .

                 The following are possible values:

                 o SetForecastCapacityToMaxCapacity  - AWS Auto Scaling cannot
                   scale resource capacity higher than the  maximum  capacity.
                   The maximum capacity is enforced as a hard limit.

                 o SetMaxCapacityToForecastCapacity  -  AWS  Auto  Scaling may
                   scale resource capacity higher than the maximum capacity to
                   equal but not exceed forecast capacity.

                 o SetMaxCapacityAboveForecastCapacity  - AWS Auto Scaling may
                   scale resource capacity higher than the maximum capacity by
                   a specified buffer value. The intention is to give the tar-
                   get tracking scaling policy extra  capacity  if  unexpected
                   traffic occurs.

                 Only valid when configuring predictive scaling.

              PredictiveScalingMaxCapacityBuffer -> (integer)
                 The  size of the capacity buffer to use when the forecast ca-
                 pacity is close to or exceeds the maximum capacity. The value
                 is  specified as a percentage relative to the forecast capac-
                 ity. For example, if the buffer is 10, this means a  10  per-
                 cent  buffer,  such  that if the forecast capacity is 50, and
                 the maximum capacity is 40, then the effective maximum capac-
                 ity is 55.

                 Only  valid  when configuring predictive scaling. Required if
                 the PredictiveScalingMaxCapacityBehavior is set to  SetMaxCa-
                 pacityAboveForecastCapacity , and cannot be used otherwise.

                 The range is 1-100.

              PredictiveScalingMode -> (string)
                 The  predictive  scaling  mode. The default value is Forecas-
                 tAndScale . Otherwise, AWS Auto  Scaling  forecasts  capacity
                 but  does  not  create any scheduled scaling actions based on
                 the capacity forecast.

              ScalingPolicyUpdateBehavior -> (string)
                 Controls whether  a  resource's  externally  created  scaling
                 policies are kept or replaced.

                 The  default value is KeepExternalPolicies . If the parameter
                 is set to ReplaceExternalPolicies , any scaling policies that
                 are  external  to AWS Auto Scaling are deleted and new target
                 tracking scaling policies created.

                 Only valid when configuring dynamic scaling.

                 Condition: The number of existing  policies  to  be  replaced
                 must  be  less than or equal to 50. If there are more than 50
                 policies to be replaced, AWS Auto Scaling keeps all  existing
                 policies and does not create new ones.

              DisableDynamicScaling -> (boolean)
                 Controls  whether dynamic scaling by AWS Auto Scaling is dis-
                 abled. When dynamic scaling is enabled, AWS Auto Scaling cre-
                 ates  target tracking scaling policies based on the specified
                 target tracking configurations.

                 The default is enabled (false ).

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To update a scaling plan

       The following update-scaling-plan example modifies the  scaling  metric
       for an Auto Scaling group in the specified scaling plan.

          aws autoscaling-plans update-scaling-plan \
              --scaling-plan-name my-scaling-plan \
              --scaling-plan-version 1 \
              --scaling-instructions '{"ScalableDimension":"autoscaling:autoScalingGroup:DesiredCapacity","ResourceId":"autoScalingGroup/my-asg","ServiceNamespace":"autoscaling","TargetTrackingConfigurations":[{"PredefinedScalingMetricSpecification": {"PredefinedScalingMetricType":"ALBRequestCountPerTarget","ResourceLabel":"app/my-alb/f37c06a68c1748aa/targetgroup/my-target-group/6d4ea56ca2d6a18d"},"TargetValue":40.0}],"MinCapacity": 1,"MaxCapacity": 10}'

       This command produces no output.
