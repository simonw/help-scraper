OPTIONS
       --tracking-id (string)
          The tracking ID for the event. The ID is generated by a call to  the
          CreateEventTracker API.

       --user-id (string)
          The user associated with the event.

       --session-id (string)
          The  session  ID  associated with the user's visit. Your application
          generates the sessionId when a user first  visits  your  website  or
          uses  your application. Amazon Personalize uses the sessionId to as-
          sociate events with the user before they log in. For  more  informa-
          tion, see Recording Events .

       --event-list (list)
          A list of event data from the session.

          (structure)
              Represents  user  interaction  event  information sent using the
              PutEvents API.

              eventId -> (string)
                 An ID associated with the event. If an event ID is  not  pro-
                 vided,  Amazon  Personalize  generates  a  unique  ID for the
                 event. An event ID is not used as an input to the model. Ama-
                 zon  Personalize  uses  the  event  ID  to distinquish unique
                 events. Any subsequent events after the first with  the  same
                 event ID are not used in model training.

              eventType -> (string)
                 The  type  of event, such as click or download. This property
                 corresponds to the  EVENT_TYPE  field  of  your  Interactions
                 schema and depends on the types of events you are tracking.

              eventValue -> (float)
                 The  event value that corresponds to the EVENT_VALUE field of
                 the Interactions schema.

              itemId -> (string)
                 The item ID key that corresponds to the ITEM_ID field of  the
                 Interactions schema.

              properties -> (string)
                 A  string map of event-specific data that you might choose to
                 record. For example, if a user rates a movie  on  your  site,
                 other  than movie ID (itemId ) and rating (eventValue ) , you
                 might also send the number of movie ratings made by the user.

                 Each item in the map consists of a key-value pair. For  exam-
                 ple,
                     {"numberOfRatings": "12"}

                 The  keys  use  camel case names that match the fields in the
                 Interactions schema. In the above example,  the  numberOfRat-
                 ings would match the 'NUMBER_OF_RATINGS' field defined in the
                 Interactions schema.

              sentAt -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp (in Unix time) on  the  client  side  when  the
                 event occurred.

              recommendationId -> (string)
                 The ID of the recommendation.

              impression -> (list)
                 A  list of item IDs that represents the sequence of items you
                 have shown the  user.  For  example,  ["itemId1",  "itemId2",
                 "itemId3"] .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          eventId=string,eventType=string,eventValue=float,itemId=string,properties=string,sentAt=timestamp,recommendationId=string,impression=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "eventId": "string",
              "eventType": "string",
              "eventValue": float,
              "itemId": "string",
              "properties": "string",
              "sentAt": timestamp,
              "recommendationId": "string",
              "impression": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)
