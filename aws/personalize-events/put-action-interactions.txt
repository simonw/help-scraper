DESCRIPTION
       Records  action  interaction event data. An action interaction event is
       an interaction between a user and an action . For example, a user  tak-
       ing  an action, such a enrolling in a membership program or downloading
       your app.

       For more information about recording action interactions, see Recording
       action  interaction  events  . For more information about actions in an
       Actions dataset, see Actions dataset .

OPTIONS
       --tracking-id (string)
          The ID of your action interaction event tracker. When you create  an
          Action  interactions  dataset,  Amazon Personalize creates an action
          interaction event tracker for you. For more information, see  Action
          interaction event tracker ID .

       --action-interactions (list)
          A list of action interaction events from the session.

          (structure)
              Represents an action interaction event sent using the PutAction-
              Interactions API.

              actionId -> (string)
                 The ID of the action the user interacted  with.  This  corre-
                 sponds  to  the  ACTION_ID  field  of  the Action interaction
                 schema.

              userId -> (string)
                 The ID of the user who interacted with the action. This  cor-
                 responds  to  the  USER_ID  field  of  the Action interaction
                 schema.

              sessionId -> (string)
                 The ID associated with the  user's  visit.  Your  application
                 generates  a  unique  sessionId when a user first visits your
                 website or uses your application.

              timestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp for when the action interaction event occurred.
                 Timestamps must be in Unix epoch time format, in seconds.

              eventType -> (string)
                 The  type of action interaction event. You can specify Viewed
                 , Taken , and Not Taken event  types.  For  more  information
                 about action interaction event type data, see Event type data
                 .

              eventId -> (string)
                 An ID associated with the event. If an event ID is  not  pro-
                 vided,  Amazon  Personalize  generates  a  unique  ID for the
                 event. An event ID is not used as an input to the model. Ama-
                 zon  Personalize  uses  the  event  ID  to distinguish unique
                 events. Any subsequent events after the first with  the  same
                 event ID are not used in model training.

              recommendationId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of the list of recommendations that contains the ac-
                 tion the user interacted with.

              impression -> (list)
                 A list of action IDs that represents the sequence of  actions
                 you  have  shown  the  user.  For example, ["actionId1", "ac-
                 tionId2", "actionId3"] . Amazon Personalize doesn't  use  im-
                 pressions  data  from  action  interaction  events.  Instead,
                 record multiple events for each action  and  use  the  Viewed
                 event type.

                 (string)

              properties -> (string)
                 A  string map of event-specific data that you might choose to
                 record. For example, if a user takes an  action,  other  than
                 the  action  ID,  you  might  also send the number of actions
                 taken by the user.

                 Each item in the map consists of a key-value pair. For  exam-
                 ple,
                     {"numberOfActions": "12"}

                 The  keys  use  camel case names that match the fields in the
                 Action interactions schema. In the above  example,  the  num-
                 berOfActions  would  match  the 'NUMBER_OF_ACTIONS' field de-
                 fined in the Action interactions schema.

                 The following can't be included as a keyword  for  properties
                 (case insensitive).

                 o userId

                 o sessionId

                 o eventType

                 o timestamp

                 o recommendationId

                 o impression

       Shorthand Syntax:

          actionId=string,userId=string,sessionId=string,timestamp=timestamp,eventType=string,eventId=string,recommendationId=string,impression=string,string,properties=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "actionId": "string",
              "userId": "string",
              "sessionId": "string",
              "timestamp": timestamp,
              "eventType": "string",
              "eventId": "string",
              "recommendationId": "string",
              "impression": ["string", ...],
              "properties": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)
