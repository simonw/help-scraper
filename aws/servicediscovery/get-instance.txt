OPTIONS
       --service-id (string)
          The ID of the service that the instance is associated with.

       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of the instance that you want to get information about.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Instance -> (structure)
          A complex type that contains information about a specified instance.

          Id -> (string)
              An identifier that you want to associate with the instance. Note
              the following:

              o If the service that's specified by ServiceId includes settings
                for  an  SRV  record, the value of InstanceId is automatically
                included as part of the value for the SRV record. For more in-
                formation, see DnsRecord > Type .

              o You can use this value to update an existing instance.

              o To  register  a  new instance, you must specify a value that's
                unique among instances that you register  by  using  the  same
                service.

              o If  you  specify  an existing InstanceId and ServiceId , Cloud
                Map updates the existing DNS records. If there's also  an  ex-
                isting  health  check,  Cloud Map deletes the old health check
                and creates a new one.

              NOTE:
                 The health check isn't deleted immediately, so it will  still
                 appear  for a while if you submit a ListHealthChecks request,
                 for example.

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A unique string that identifies  the  request  and  that  allows
              failed  RegisterInstance requests to be retried without the risk
              of executing the operation twice. You must use a unique Creator-
              RequestId  string  every  time you submit a RegisterInstance re-
              quest if you're registering additional instances  for  the  same
              namespace and service. CreatorRequestId can be any unique string
              (for example, a date/time stamp).

          Attributes -> (map)
              A string map that contains the  following  information  for  the
              service that you specify in ServiceId :

              o The  attributes  that apply to the records that are defined in
                the service.

              o For each attribute, the applicable value.

              NOTE:
                 Do not include sensitive information in the attributes if the
                 namespace is discoverable by public DNS queries.

              Supported attribute keys include the following:
                 AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME

              If  you  want  Cloud  Map to create a Route 53 alias record that
              routes traffic to an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, spec-
              ify  the  DNS name that's associated with the load balancer. For
              information   about   how   to   get   the   DNS    name,    see
              AliasTarget->DNSName in the Route 53 API Reference .

              Note the following:

              o The  configuration  for the service that's specified by Servi-
                ceId must include settings for an A record, an AAAA record, or
                both.

              o In  the  service  that's specified by ServiceId , the value of
                RoutingPolicy must be WEIGHTED .

              o If  the  service  that's  specified  by   ServiceId   includes
                HealthCheckConfig  settings,  Cloud  Map  creates  the  health
                check, but it won't associate the health check with the  alias
                record.

              o Auto  naming  currently doesn't support creating alias records
                that route traffic to Amazon Web Services resources other than
                ELB load balancers.

              o If  you specify a value for AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME , don't specify
                values for any of the AWS_INSTANCE attributes.

                AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_ID
                 HTTP namespaces only. The Amazon EC2 instance ID for the  in-
                 stance.  The AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4 attribute contains the primary
                 private IPv4 address.
                     AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS

              If the service configuration includes HealthCheckCustomConfig  ,
              you  can  optionally  use  AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS to specify the
              initial status of the custom health check, HEALTHY or  UNHEALTHY
              .  If you don't specify a value for AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS , the
              initial status is HEALTHY .
                 AWS_INSTANCE_CNAME

              If the service configuration includes a CNAME record, the domain
              name that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries
              (for example, example.com ).

              This value is required if the service specified by ServiceId in-
              cludes settings for an CNAME record.
                 AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4

              If  the service configuration includes an A record, the IPv4 ad-
              dress that you want Route  53  to  return  in  response  to  DNS
              queries (for example, 192.0.2.44 ).

              This value is required if the service specified by ServiceId in-
              cludes settings for an A record. If the  service  includes  set-
              tings  for  an  SRV record, you must specify a value for AWS_IN-
              STANCE_IPV4 , AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6 , or both.
                 AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6

              If the service configuration includes an AAAA record,  the  IPv6
              address  that  you  want  Route  53 to return in response to DNS
              queries (for example, 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345 ).

              This value is required if the service specified by ServiceId in-
              cludes settings for an AAAA record. If the service includes set-
              tings for an SRV record, you must specify a  value  for  AWS_IN-
              STANCE_IPV4 , AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6 , or both.
                 AWS_INSTANCE_PORT

              If  the  service includes an SRV record, the value that you want
              Route 53 to return for the port.

              If the service includes HealthCheckConfig , the port on the end-
              point that you want Route 53 to send requests to.

              This  value  is  required  if  you specified settings for an SRV
              record or a Route 53 health check when you created the service.
