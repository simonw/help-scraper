DISCOVER-INSTANCES()                                      DISCOVER-INSTANCES()



NAME
       discover-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Discovers  registered  instances for a specified namespace and service.
       You can use DiscoverInstances to discover instances  for  any  type  of
       namespace.  For public and private DNS namespaces, you can also use DNS
       queries to discover instances.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            discover-instances
          --namespace-name <value>
          --service-name <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--query-parameters <value>]
          [--optional-parameters <value>]
          [--health-status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --namespace-name (string)
          The HttpName name of the namespace. It's found in the HttpProperties
          member of the Properties member of the namespace.

       --service-name (string)
          The  name  of the service that you specified when you registered the
          instance.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of instances that you want Cloud Map to return in
          the  response to a DiscoverInstances request. If you don't specify a
          value for MaxResults , Cloud Map returns up to 100 instances.

       --query-parameters (map)
          Filters to scope the results based on custom attributes for the  in-
          stance  (for  example,  {version=v1,  az=1a}  ). Only instances that
          match all the specified key-value pairs are returned.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --optional-parameters (map)
          Opportunistic filters to scope  the  results  based  on  custom  at-
          tributes.  If there are instances that match both the filters speci-
          fied in both the QueryParameters parameter and this  parameter,  all
          of these instances are returned. Otherwise, the filters are ignored,
          and only instances that match the filters that are specified in  the
          QueryParameters parameter are returned.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --health-status (string)
          The  health  status of the instances that you want to discover. This
          parameter is ignored for services that don't  have  a  health  check
          configured, and all instances are returned.
              HEALTHY

          Returns healthy instances.
              UNHEALTHY

          Returns unhealthy instances.
              ALL

          Returns all instances.
              HEALTHY_OR_ELSE_ALL

          Returns  healthy  instances,  unless  none  are  reporting a healthy
          state. In that case, return all instances. This is also called fail-
          ing open.

          Possible values:

          o HEALTHY

          o UNHEALTHY

          o ALL

          o HEALTHY_OR_ELSE_ALL

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To discover registered instances

       The  following  discover-instances  example  discovers  registered  in-
       stances.

          aws servicediscovery discover-instances \
              --namespace-name example.com \
              --service-name myservice \
              --max-results 10 \
              --health-status ALL

       Output:

          {
              "Instances": [
                  {
                      "InstanceId": "myservice-53",
                      "NamespaceName": "example.com",
                      "ServiceName": "myservice",
                      "HealthStatus": "UNKNOWN",
                      "Attributes": {
                          "AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4": "172.2.1.3",
                          "AWS_INSTANCE_PORT": "808"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Instances -> (list)

          tered instance.

          (structure)
              In a response to a DiscoverInstances  request,  HttpInstanceSum-
              mary  contains  information  about one instance that matches the
              values that you specified in the request.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The ID of an instance that matches the values that you speci-
                 fied in the request.

              NamespaceName -> (string)
                 The  HttpName  name of the namespace. It's found in the Http-
                 Properties member of the Properties member of the namespace.

              ServiceName -> (string)
                 The name of the service that you specified  when  you  regis-
                 tered the instance.

              HealthStatus -> (string)
                 If you configured health checking in the service, the current
                 health status of the service instance.

              Attributes -> (map)
                 If you included any attributes when you  registered  the  in-
                 stance, the values of those attributes.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)
