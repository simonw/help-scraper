LIST-OPERATIONS()                                            LIST-OPERATIONS()



NAME
       list-operations -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists operations that match the criteria that you specify.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-operations is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Operations

SYNOPSIS
            list-operations
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          A complex type that contains specifications for the operations  that
          you want to list, for example, operations that you started between a
          specified start date and end date.

          If you specify more than one filter, an  operation  must  match  all
          filters to be returned by ListOperations .

          (structure)
              A complex type that lets you select the operations that you want
              to list.

              Name -> (string)
                 Specify the operations that you want to get:

                 o NAMESPACE_ID : Gets operations related to  specified  name-
                   spaces.

                 o SERVICE_ID : Gets operations related to specified services.

                 o STATUS  : Gets operations based on the status of the opera-
                   tions: SUBMITTED , PENDING , SUCCEED , or FAIL .

                 o TYPE : Gets specified types of operation.

                 o UPDATE_DATE : Gets operations that changed status during  a
                   specified date/time range.

              Values -> (list)
                 Specify  values  that  are  applicable  to the value that you
                 specify for Name :

                 o NAMESPACE_ID : Specify one namespace ID.

                 o SERVICE_ID : Specify one service ID.

                 o STATUS : Specify one or more statuses: SUBMITTED ,  PENDING
                   , SUCCEED , or FAIL .

                 o TYPE  :  Specify  one  or more of the following types: CRE-
                   ATE_NAMESPACE , DELETE_NAMESPACE , UPDATE_SERVICE ,  REGIS-
                   TER_INSTANCE , or DEREGISTER_INSTANCE .

                 o UPDATE_DATE  : Specify a start date and an end date in Unix
                   date/time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  The
                   start date must be the first value.

                 (string)

              Condition -> (string)
                 The operator that you want to use to determine whether an op-
                 eration matches the specified value. Valid values for  condi-
                 tion include:

                 o EQ : When you specify EQ for the condition, you can specify
                   only one value. EQ is supported  for  NAMESPACE_ID  ,  SER-
                   VICE_ID  ,  STATUS , and TYPE . EQ is the default condition
                   and can be omitted.

                 o IN : When you specify IN for the condition, you can specify
                   a  list  of  one or more values. IN is supported for STATUS
                   and TYPE . An operation must match  one  of  the  specified
                   values to be returned in the response.

                 o BETWEEN  :  Specify  a  start  date and an end date in Unix
                   date/time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  The
                   start  date  must  be the first value. BETWEEN is supported
                   for UPDATE_DATE .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string,Condition=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "NAMESPACE_ID"|"SERVICE_ID"|"STATUS"|"TYPE"|"UPDATE_DATE",
              "Values": ["string", ...],
              "Condition": "EQ"|"IN"|"BETWEEN"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Operations -> (list)
          Summary  information  about  the operations that match the specified
          criteria.

          (structure)
              A complex type that contains information about an operation that
              matches  the criteria that you specified in a ListOperations re-
              quest.

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID for an operation.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the operation. Values include the following:

                 o SUBMITTED : This is the initial state immediately after you
                   submit a request.

                 o PENDING : Cloud Map is performing the operation.

                 o SUCCESS : The operation succeeded.

                 o FAIL  :  The  operation failed. For the failure reason, see
                   ErrorMessage .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response contains NextToken , submit  another  ListOperations
          request to get the next group of results. Specify the value of Next-
          Token from the previous response in the next request.

          NOTE:
              Cloud Map gets MaxResults operations and then filters them based
              on  the  specified criteria. It's possible that no operations in
              the first MaxResults operations matched the  specified  criteria
              but  that  subsequent groups of MaxResults operations do contain
              operations that match the criteria.
