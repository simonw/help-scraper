LIST-INSTANCES()                                              LIST-INSTANCES()



NAME
       list-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  summary  information  about the instances that you registered by
       using a specified service.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-instances is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Instances

SYNOPSIS
            list-instances
          --service-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-id (string)
          The ID of the service that you want to list instances for.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list service instances

       The following list-instances example lists service instances.

          aws servicediscovery list-instances \
              --service-id srv-qzpwvt2tfqcegapy

       Output:

          {
              "Instances": [
                  {
                      "Id": "i-06bdabbae60f65a4e",
                      "Attributes": {
                          "AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4": "172.2.1.3",
                          "AWS_INSTANCE_PORT": "808"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Viewing a list of service  instances  in  the
       AWS Cloud Map Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       Instances -> (list)
          Summary information about the instances that are associated with the
          specified service.

          (structure)
              A complex type that contains  information  about  the  instances
              that you registered by using a specified service.

              Id -> (string)
                 The  ID for an instance that you created by using a specified
                 service.

              Attributes -> (map)
                 A string map that contains the following information:

                 o The attributes that are associated with the instance.

                 o For each attribute, the applicable value.

                 Supported attribute keys include the following:
                     AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME

                 For an alias record that routes traffic to  an  Elastic  Load
                 Balancing  load balancer, the DNS name that's associated with
                 the load balancer.
                     AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_ID (HTTP namespaces only)

                 The Amazon  EC2  instance  ID  for  the  instance.  When  the
                 AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_ID  attribute is specified, then the AWS_IN-
                 STANCE_IPV4 attribute contains the primary private  IPv4  ad-
                 dress.
                     AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS

                 If the service configuration includes HealthCheckCustomConfig
                 , you can optionally use  AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS  to  specify
                 the initial status of the custom health check, HEALTHY or UN-
                 HEALTHY   .   If   you   don't   specify    a    value    for
                 AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS , the initial status is HEALTHY .
                     AWS_INSTANCE_CNAME

                 For  a CNAME record, the domain name that Route 53 returns in
                 response to DNS queries (for example, example.com ).
                     AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4

                 For an A record, the IPv4 address that Route  53  returns  in
                 response to DNS queries (for example, 192.0.2.44 ).
                     AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6

                 For an AAAA record, the IPv6 address that Route 53 returns in
                 response     to      DNS      queries      (for      example,
                 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345 ).
                     AWS_INSTANCE_PORT

                 For  an  SRV  record, the value that Route 53 returns for the
                 port. In addition, if the service includes  HealthCheckConfig
                 , the port on the endpoint that Route 53 sends requests to.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  more than MaxResults instances match the specified criteria, you
          can submit another ListInstances request to get the  next  group  of
          results.  Specify  the value of NextToken from the previous response
          in the next request.
