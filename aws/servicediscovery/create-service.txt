CREATE-SERVICE()                                              CREATE-SERVICE()



NAME
       create-service -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  service. This action defines the configuration for the fol-
       lowing entities:

       o For public and private DNS namespaces, one of the following  combina-
         tions of DNS records in Amazon Route 53:

         o A

         o AAAA

         o A and AAAA

         o SRV

         o CNAME

       o Optionally, a health check

       After  you  create  the  service, you can submit a RegisterInstance re-
       quest, and Cloud Map uses the values in the configuration to create the
       specified entities.

       For  the current quota on the number of instances that you can register
       using the same namespace and using the same service, see Cloud Map quo-
       tas in the Cloud Map Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name that you want to assign to the service.

          NOTE:
              Do  not  include  sensitive information in the name if the name-
              space is discoverable by public DNS queries.

          If you want Cloud Map to create an SRV record when you  register  an
          instance and you're using a system that requires a specific SRV for-
          mat, such as HAProxy , specify the following for Name :

          o Start the name with an underscore (_), such as _exampleservice .

          o End the name with ._protocol , such as ._tcp .

          When you register an instance, Cloud Map creates an SRV  record  and
          assigns  a  name to the record by concatenating the service name and
          the namespace name (for example,
              _exampleservice._tcp.example.com ).

          NOTE:
              For services that are accessible by DNS queries, you can't  cre-
              ate  multiple services with names that differ only by case (such
              as EXAMPLE and example). Otherwise, these services have the same
              DNS name and can't be distinguished. However, if you use a name-
              space that's only accessible by API calls, then you  can  create
              services that with names that differ only by case.

       --namespace-id (string)
          The  ID of the namespace that you want to use to create the service.
          The namespace ID must be specified, but it can be  specified  either
          here or in the DnsConfig object.

       --creator-request-id (string)
          A  unique  string that identifies the request and that allows failed
          CreateService requests to be retried without the risk of running the
          operation  twice. CreatorRequestId can be any unique string (for ex-
          ample, a date/timestamp).

       --description (string)
          A description for the service.

       --dns-config (structure)
          A complex type that contains information about the Amazon  Route  53
          records  that  you want Cloud Map to create when you register an in-
          stance.

          NamespaceId -> (string)
                 Use   NamespaceId    in    `Service    <https://docs.aws.ama-
                 zon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_Service.html>`__ instead.

              The ID of the namespace to use for DNS configuration.

          RoutingPolicy -> (string)
              The  routing  policy  that you want to apply to all Route 53 DNS
              records that Cloud Map creates when you register an instance and
              specify this service.

              NOTE:
                 If  you  want  to use this service to register instances that
                 create alias records, specify WEIGHTED for the  routing  pol-
                 icy.

              You can specify the following values:
                 MULTIVALUE

              If  you  define  a  health  check for the service and the health
              check is healthy, Route 53 returns the applicable value  for  up
              to eight instances.

              For  example,  suppose  that the service includes configurations
              for one A record and a health check. You use the service to reg-
              ister 10 instances. Route 53 responds to DNS queries with IP ad-
              dresses for up to eight healthy instances. If fewer  than  eight
              instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to every DNS query with
              the IP addresses for all of the healthy instances.

              If you don't define a health check for the service, Route 53 as-
              sumes  that all instances are healthy and returns the values for
              up to eight instances.

              For more information about the multivalue  routing  policy,  see
              Multivalue Answer Routing in the Route 53 Developer Guide .
                 WEIGHTED

              Route 53 returns the applicable value from one randomly selected
              instance from among the instances that you registered using  the
              same  service.  Currently,  all records have the same weight, so
              you can't route more or less traffic to any instances.

              For example, suppose that the  service  includes  configurations
              for one A record and a health check. You use the service to reg-
              ister 10 instances. Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the IP
              address  for  one  randomly  selected  instance  from  among the
              healthy instances. If no instances are  healthy,  Route  53  re-
              sponds to DNS queries as if all of the instances were healthy.

              If you don't define a health check for the service, Route 53 as-
              sumes that all instances are healthy and returns the  applicable
              value for one randomly selected instance.

              For  more  information  about  the  weighted routing policy, see
              Weighted Routing in the Route 53 Developer Guide .

          DnsRecords -> (list)
              An array that contains one DnsRecord object for  each  Route  53
              DNS  record  that you want Cloud Map to create when you register
              an instance.

              (structure)
                 A complex type that contains information about the  Route  53
                 DNS records that you want Cloud Map to create when you regis-
                 ter an instance.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of the resource, which  indicates  the  type  of
                     value  that  Route 53 returns in response to DNS queries.
                     You can specify values for Type in the following combina-
                     tions:

                     o

                       **
                       A **

                     System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 263)
                       Inline strong start-string without end-string.

                     o

                       **
                       AAAA **

                     System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 265)
                       Inline strong start-string without end-string.

                     o

                       **
                       A ** and ** AAAA **

                     System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 267)
                       Inline strong start-string without end-string.

                     o

                       **
                       SRV **

                     System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 269)
                       Inline strong start-string without end-string.

                     o

                       **
                       CNAME **

                     System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 271)
                       Inline strong start-string without end-string.

                     If  you  want Cloud Map to create a Route 53 alias record
                     when you register an instance, specify A or AAAA for Type
                     .

                     You  specify other settings, such as the IP address for A
                     and AAAA records, when you register an instance. For more
                     information, see RegisterInstance .

                     The following values are supported:
                        A

                     Route  53  returns the IP address of the resource in IPv4
                     format, such as 192.0.2.44.
                        AAAA

                     Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource  in  IPv6
                     format, such as 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345.
                        CNAME

                     Route 53 returns the domain name of the resource, such as
                     www.example.com. Note the following:

                     o You specify the domain name  that  you  want  to  route
                       traffic  to when you register an instance. For more in-
                       formation, see Attributes in the topic RegisterInstance
                       .

                     o You  must specify WEIGHTED for the value of RoutingPol-
                       icy .

                     o You can't specify both CNAME for Type and settings  for
                       HealthCheckConfig  .  If  you do, the request will fail
                       with an InvalidInput error.

                       SRV

                     Route 53 returns the value for an SRV record.  The  value
                     for an SRV record uses the following values:
                        priority weight port service-hostname

                     Note the following about the values:

                     o The values of priority and weight are both set to 1 and
                       can't be changed.

                     o The value of port comes from the value that you specify
                       for  the  AWS_INSTANCE_PORT attribute when you submit a
                       RegisterInstance request.

                     o The value of service-hostname is a concatenation of the
                       following values:

                       o The  value  that  you specify for InstanceId when you
                         register an instance.

                       o The name of the service.

                       o The name of the namespace.

                     For example, if the value of InstanceId  is  test  ,  the
                     name  of  the  service  is  backend , and the name of the
                     namespace is example.com , the value of  service-hostname
                     is the following:
                        test.backend.example.com

                     If  you specify settings for an SRV record, note the fol-
                     lowing:

                     o If you specify values for AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4  ,  AWS_IN-
                       STANCE_IPV6  , or both in the RegisterInstance request,
                       Cloud Map automatically creates A and/or  AAAA  records
                       that  have  the same name as the value of service-host-
                       name in the SRV record. You can ignore these records.

                     o If you're using a system that requires a  specific  SRV
                       format,  such  as  HAProxy, see the Name element in the
                       documentation about CreateService for information about
                       how to specify the correct name format.

                 TTL -> (long)
                     The  amount  of  time,  in seconds, that you want DNS re-
                     solvers to cache the settings for this record.

                     NOTE:
                        Alias records don't include a  TTL  because  Route  53
                        uses the TTL for the Amazon Web Services resource that
                        an alias record routes traffic to. If you include  the
                        AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME   attribute   when   you  submit  a
                        RegisterInstance request, the TTL  value  is  ignored.
                        Always  specify  a  TTL for the service; you can use a
                        service to register instances that create either alias
                        or non-alias records.

              ...
            ]
          }

       --health-check-config (structure)
              Public  DNS  and  HTTP namespaces only. A complex type that con-
              tains settings for an optional Route 53  health  check.  If  you
              specify  settings  for  a health check, Cloud Map associates the
              health check with all the Route 53 DNS records that you  specify
              in DnsConfig .

          WARNING:
              If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify ei-
              ther HealthCheckCustomConfig or HealthCheckConfig but not both.

          For information about the charges for health checks, see  Cloud  Map
          Pricing .

          Type -> (string)
              The  type  of  health check that you want to create, which indi-
              cates how Route 53 determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

              WARNING:
                 You can't change the value of Type after you create a  health
                 check.

              You can create the following types of health checks:

              o HTTP  :  Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If suc-
                cessful, Route 53 submits an HTTP request  and  waits  for  an
                HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

              o HTTPS  : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If suc-
                cessful, Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and  waits  for  an
                HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

              WARNING:
                 If  you  specify  HTTPS  for the value of Type , the endpoint
                 must support TLS v1.0 or later.

              o TCP : Route 53 tries to establish a  TCP  connection.  If  you
                specify  TCP for Type , don't specify a value for ResourcePath
                .

              For more information, see How Route  53  Determines  Whether  an
              Endpoint Is Healthy in the Route 53 Developer Guide .

          ResourcePath -> (string)
              The  path  that  you  want  Route  53 to request when performing
              health checks. The path can be any value that your endpoint  re-
              turns  an  HTTP  status code of a 2xx or 3xx format for when the
              endpoint     is     healthy.     An     example     file      is
              /docs/route53-health-check.html  .  Route  53 automatically adds
              the DNS name for the service. If you don't specify a  value  for
              ResourcePath , the default value is / .

              If  you  specify TCP for Type , you must not specify a value for
              ResourcePath .

          FailureThreshold -> (integer)
              The number of consecutive health checks that  an  endpoint  must
              pass  or  fail  for Route 53 to change the current status of the
              endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or the other way around.  For
              more  information,  see  How Route 53 Determines Whether an End-
              point Is Healthy in the Route 53 Developer Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,ResourcePath=string,FailureThreshold=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Type": "HTTP"|"HTTPS"|"TCP",
            "ResourcePath": "string",
            "FailureThreshold": integer
          }

       --health-check-custom-config (structure)
          A complex type that contains information about  an  optional  custom
          health check.

          WARNING:
              If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify ei-
              ther HealthCheckCustomConfig or HealthCheckConfig but not both.

          You can't add, update, or delete a HealthCheckCustomConfig  configu-
          ration from an existing service.

          FailureThreshold -> (integer)

              WARNING:
                 This parameter is no longer supported and is always set to 1.
                 Cloud Map waits for approximately 30 seconds after  receiving
                 an  UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus  request before changing
                 the status of the service instance.

              The number of 30-second intervals that you  want  Cloud  Map  to
              wait after receiving an UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus request
              before it changes the health status of a service instance.

              Sending a second or subsequent  UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus
              request with the same value before 30 seconds has passed doesn't
              accelerate the change. Cloud Map still waits  30  seconds  after
              the first request to make the change.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          }

       --tags (list)
          The  tags  to  add to the service. Each tag consists of a key and an
          optional value that you define. Tags keys can be up to  128  charac-
          ters  in  length,  and  tag  values  can  be up to 256 characters in
          length.

          (structure)
              A custom key-value pair that's associated with a resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The string value that's associated with the key of  the  tag.
                 You  can  set  the value of a tag to an empty string, but you
                 can't set the value of a tag to null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --type (string)
          If present, specifies that the service instances are only  discover-
          able  using  the  DiscoverInstances API operation. No DNS records is
          registered for the service instances. The only valid value is HTTP .

          Possible values:

          o HTTP

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a service

       The following create-service example creates a service.

          aws servicediscovery create-service \
              --name myservice \
              --namespace-id  ns-ylexjili4cdxy3xm \
              --dns-config "NamespaceId=ns-ylexjili4cdxy3xm,RoutingPolicy=MULTIVALUE,DnsRecords=[{Type=A,TTL=60}]"

       Output:

          {
                  "Service": {
                  "Id": "srv-p5zdwlg5uvvzjita",

OUTPUT
       Service -> (structure)
          A complex type that contains information about the new service.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID that Cloud Map assigned to the service when  you  created
              it.

          Arn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) that Cloud Map assigns to the
              service when you create it.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the service.

          NamespaceId -> (string)
              The ID of the namespace that was used to create the service.

          Description -> (string)
              The description of the service.

          InstanceCount -> (integer)
              The number of instances that are currently associated  with  the
              service. Instances that were previously associated with the ser-
              vice but that are deleted aren't  included  in  the  count.  The
              count  might  not  reflect pending registrations and deregistra-
              tions.

          DnsConfig -> (structure)
              A complex type that contains information about the Route 53  DNS
              records  that  you want Cloud Map to create when you register an
              instance.

              WARNING:
                 The record types of a service can only be changed by deleting
                 the service and recreating it with a new Dnsconfig .

              NamespaceId -> (string)
                     Use   NamespaceId   in   `Service  <https://docs.aws.ama-
                     zon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_Service.html>`__     in-
                     stead.

                 The ID of the namespace to use for DNS configuration.

              RoutingPolicy -> (string)
                 The routing policy that you want to apply to all Route 53 DNS
                 records that Cloud Map creates when you register an  instance
                 and specify this service.

                 NOTE:
                     If  you  want  to  use this service to register instances
                     that create alias records, specify WEIGHTED for the rout-
                     ing policy.

                 You can specify the following values:
                     MULTIVALUE

                 If  you  define a health check for the service and the health
                 check is healthy, Route 53 returns the applicable  value  for
                 up to eight instances.

                 For example, suppose that the service includes configurations
                 for one A record and a health check. You use the  service  to
                 register  10 instances. Route 53 responds to DNS queries with
                 IP addresses for up to eight healthy instances. If fewer than
                 eight  instances  are healthy, Route 53 responds to every DNS
                 query with the IP addresses for all of the healthy instances.

                 If you don't define a health check for the service, Route  53
                 assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the values
                 for up to eight instances.

                 For more information about the multivalue routing policy, see
                 Multivalue Answer Routing in the Route 53 Developer Guide .
                     WEIGHTED

                 Route  53  returns the applicable value from one randomly se-
                 lected instance from among the instances that you  registered
                 using  the same service. Currently, all records have the same
                 weight, so you can't route more or less traffic  to  any  in-
                 stances.

                 For example, suppose that the service includes configurations
                 for one A record and a health check. You use the  service  to
                 register  10 instances. Route 53 responds to DNS queries with
                 the IP address for one randomly selected instance from  among
                 the  healthy instances. If no instances are healthy, Route 53
                 responds to DNS queries as  if  all  of  the  instances  were
                 healthy.

                 If  you don't define a health check for the service, Route 53
                 assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the appli-
                 cable value for one randomly selected instance.

                 For  more  information about the weighted routing policy, see
                 Weighted Routing in the Route 53 Developer Guide .

              DnsRecords -> (list)
                 An array that contains one DnsRecord object for each Route 53
                 DNS  record that you want Cloud Map to create when you regis-
                 ter an instance.

                 (structure)
                     A complex type that contains information about the  Route
                     53 DNS records that you want Cloud Map to create when you
                     register an instance.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The type of the resource, which indicates the type  of
                        value  that  Route  53  returns  in  response  to  DNS
                        queries. You can specify values for Type in  the  fol-
                        lowing combinations:

                        o

                          **

                        If  you  want  Cloud  Map  to  create a Route 53 alias
                        record when you register an  instance,  specify  A  or
                        AAAA for Type .

                        You specify other settings, such as the IP address for
                        A and AAAA records, when you register an instance. For
                        more information, see RegisterInstance .

                        The following values are supported:
                            A

                        Route  53  returns  the  IP address of the resource in
                        IPv4 format, such as 192.0.2.44.
                            AAAA

                        Route 53 returns the IP address  of  the  resource  in
                        IPv6             format,            such            as
                        2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345.
                            CNAME

                        Route 53 returns the domain name of the resource, such
                        as www.example.com. Note the following:

                        o You  specify  the domain name that you want to route
                          traffic to when you register an instance.  For  more
                          information,    see    Attributes   in   the   topic
                          RegisterInstance .

                        o You must specify WEIGHTED for the value of  Routing-
                          Policy .

                        o You  can't  specify both CNAME for Type and settings
                          for HealthCheckConfig . If you do, the request  will
                          fail with an InvalidInput error.

                          SRV

                        Route  53  returns  the  value  for an SRV record. The
                        value for an SRV record uses the following values:
                            priority weight port service-hostname

                        Note the following about the values:

                        o The values of priority and weight are both set to  1
                          and can't be changed.

                        o The  value  of  port  comes  from the value that you
                          specify for the AWS_INSTANCE_PORT attribute when you
                          submit a RegisterInstance request.

                        o The  value of service-hostname is a concatenation of
                          the following values:

                          o The value that you specify for InstanceId when you
                            register an instance.

                          o The name of the service.

                          o The name of the namespace.

                        For  example, if the value of InstanceId is test , the
                        name of the service is backend , and the name  of  the
                        namespace  is example.com , the value of service-host-
                        name is the following:
                            test.backend.example.com

                        If you specify settings for an SRV  record,  note  the
                        following:

                        o If   you  specify  values  for  AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4  ,
                          AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6 , or both in the  RegisterInstance
                          request,  Cloud  Map  automatically creates A and/or
                          AAAA records that have the same name as the value of
                          service-hostname  in  the SRV record. You can ignore
                          these records.

                        o If you're using a system that  requires  a  specific
                          SRV format, such as HAProxy, see the Name element in
                          the documentation about CreateService  for  informa-
                          tion about how to specify the correct name format.

                     TTL -> (long)
                        The  amount of time, in seconds, that you want DNS re-
                        solvers to cache the settings for this record.

                        NOTE:
                            Alias records don't include a TTL because Route 53
                            uses  the TTL for the Amazon Web Services resource
                            that an alias record routes traffic to. If you in-
                            clude  the  AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME  attribute when you
                            submit a RegisterInstance request, the  TTL  value
                            is  ignored. Always specify a TTL for the service;
                            you can use a service to register  instances  that
                            create either alias or non-alias records.

          Type -> (string)
              Describes  the  systems that can be used to discover the service
              instances.
                 DNS_HTTP

              The service instances can be discovered using either DNS queries
              or the DiscoverInstances API operation.
                 HTTP

              The  service  instances can only be discovered using the Discov-
              erInstances API operation.
                 DNS

              Reserved.

          HealthCheckConfig -> (structure)
                 Public DNS and HTTP namespaces only. A complex type that con-
                 tains  settings  for an optional health check. If you specify
                 settings for a health check, Cloud Map associates the  health
                 check with the records that you specify in DnsConfig .

              For  information about the charges for health checks, see Amazon
              Route 53 Pricing .

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of health check that you want to create, which indi-
                 cates how Route 53 determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

                 WARNING:
                     You  can't  change  the  value of Type after you create a
                     health check.

                 You can create the following types of health checks:

                 o HTTP : Route 53 tries to establish  a  TCP  connection.  If
                   successful,  Route 53 submits an HTTP request and waits for
                   an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

                 o HTTPS : Route 53 tries to establish a  TCP  connection.  If
                   successful, Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for
                   an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

                 WARNING:
                     If you specify HTTPS for the value of Type , the endpoint
                     must support TLS v1.0 or later.

                 o TCP  : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If you
                   specify TCP for Type , don't specify a  value  for  Resour-
                   cePath .

                 For  more information, see How Route 53 Determines Whether an
                 Endpoint Is Healthy in the Route 53 Developer Guide .

              ResourcePath -> (string)
                 The path that you want Route 53 to  request  when  performing
                 health  checks.  The path can be any value that your endpoint
                 returns an HTTP status code of a 2xx or 3xx format  for  when
                 the    endpoint    is    healthy.    An   example   file   is
                 /docs/route53-health-check.html . Route 53 automatically adds
                 the  DNS  name  for the service. If you don't specify a value
                 for ResourcePath , the default value is / .

                 If you specify TCP for Type , you must not  specify  a  value
                 for ResourcePath .

              FailureThreshold -> (integer)
                 The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must
                 pass or fail for Route 53 to change the current status of the
                 endpoint  from  unhealthy to healthy or the other way around.
                 For more information, see How Route 53 Determines Whether  an
                 Endpoint Is Healthy in the Route 53 Developer Guide .

          HealthCheckCustomConfig -> (structure)
              A  complex type that contains information about an optional cus-
              tom health check.

              WARNING:
                 If you specify a health check configuration, you can  specify
                 either  HealthCheckCustomConfig  or HealthCheckConfig but not
                 both.

              FailureThreshold -> (integer)

                 WARNING:
                     This parameter is no longer supported and is  always  set
                     to  1. Cloud Map waits for approximately 30 seconds after
                     receiving an UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus request be-
                     fore changing the status of the service instance.

                 The  number of 30-second intervals that you want Cloud Map to
                 wait after receiving an UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus  re-
                 quest  before  it  changes the health status of a service in-
                 stance.

                 Sending a second or subsequent UpdateInstanceCustomHealthSta-
                 tus  request with the same value before 30 seconds has passed
                 doesn't accelerate the change. Cloud Map still waits 30  sec-
                 onds after the first request to make the change.

          CreateDate -> (timestamp)
              The  date  and time that the service was created, in Unix format
              and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of CreateDate is
              accurate  to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087
              represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A unique string that identifies  the  request  and  that  allows
              failed  requests  to  be retried without the risk of running the
              operation twice. CreatorRequestId can be any unique string  (for
              example, a date/timestamp).



                                                              CREATE-SERVICE()
