OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The ID of the service that you want to get settings for.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Service -> (structure)
          A complex type that contains information about the service.

          Id -> (string)
              The  ID  that Cloud Map assigned to the service when you created
              it.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that Cloud  Map  assigns  to  the
              service when you create it.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the service.

          NamespaceId -> (string)
              The ID of the namespace that was used to create the service.

          Description -> (string)
              The description of the service.

          InstanceCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of instances that are currently associated with the
              service. Instances that were previously associated with the ser-
              vice  but  that  are  deleted  aren't included in the count. The
              count might not reflect pending  registrations  and  deregistra-
              tions.

          DnsConfig -> (structure)
              A  complex type that contains information about the Route 53 DNS
              records that you want Cloud Map to create when you  register  an
              instance.

              WARNING:
                 The record types of a service can only be changed by deleting
                 the service and recreating it with a new Dnsconfig .

              NamespaceId -> (string)
                     Use  NamespaceId   in   `Service   <https://docs.aws.ama-
                     zon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_Service.html>`__     in-
                     stead.

                 The ID of the namespace to use for DNS configuration.

              RoutingPolicy -> (string)
                 The routing policy that you want to apply to all Route 53 DNS
                 records  that Cloud Map creates when you register an instance
                 and specify this service.

                 NOTE:
                     If you want to use this  service  to  register  instances
                     that create alias records, specify WEIGHTED for the rout-
                     ing policy.

                 You can specify the following values:
                     MULTIVALUE

                 If you define a health check for the service and  the  health
                 check  is  healthy, Route 53 returns the applicable value for
                 up to eight instances.

                 For example, suppose that the service includes configurations
                 for  one  A record and a health check. You use the service to
                 register 10 instances. Route 53 responds to DNS queries  with
                 IP addresses for up to eight healthy instances. If fewer than
                 eight instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to  every  DNS
                 query with the IP addresses for all of the healthy instances.

                 If  you don't define a health check for the service, Route 53
                 assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the values
                 for up to eight instances.

                 For more information about the multivalue routing policy, see
                 Multivalue Answer Routing in the Route 53 Developer Guide .
                     WEIGHTED

                 Route 53 returns the applicable value from one  randomly  se-
                 lected  instance from among the instances that you registered
                 using the same service. Currently, all records have the  same
                 weight,  so  you  can't route more or less traffic to any in-
                 stances.

                 For example, suppose that the service includes configurations
                 for  one  A record and a health check. You use the service to
                 register 10 instances. Route 53 responds to DNS queries  with
                 the  IP address for one randomly selected instance from among
                 the healthy instances. If no instances are healthy, Route  53
                 responds  to  DNS  queries  as  if  all of the instances were
                 healthy.

                 If you don't define a health check for the service, Route  53
                 assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the appli-
                 cable value for one randomly selected instance.

                 For more information about the weighted routing  policy,  see
                 Weighted Routing in the Route 53 Developer Guide .

              DnsRecords -> (list)
                 An array that contains one DnsRecord object for each Route 53
                 DNS record that you want Cloud Map to create when you  regis-
                 ter an instance.

                 (structure)
                     A  complex type that contains information about the Route
                     53 DNS records that you want Cloud Map to create when you
                     register an instance.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The  type of the resource, which indicates the type of
                        value  that  Route  53  returns  in  response  to  DNS
                        queries.  You  can specify values for Type in the fol-
                        lowing combinations:

                        o

                          **
                          A **

                        System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 335)
                          Inline strong start-string without end-string.

                        o

                          **
                          AAAA **

                          Inline strong start-string without end-string.

                        If you want Cloud Map  to  create  a  Route  53  alias
                        record  when  you  register  an instance, specify A or
                        AAAA for Type .

                        You specify other settings, such as the IP address for
                        A and AAAA records, when you register an instance. For
                        more information, see RegisterInstance .

                        The following values are supported:
                            A

                        Route 53 returns the IP address  of  the  resource  in
                        IPv4 format, such as 192.0.2.44.
                            AAAA

                        Route  53  returns  the  IP address of the resource in
                        IPv6            format,            such             as
                        2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345.
                            CNAME

                        Route 53 returns the domain name of the resource, such
                        as www.example.com. Note the following:

                        o You specify the domain name that you want  to  route
                          traffic  to  when you register an instance. For more
                          information,   see   Attributes   in    the    topic
                          RegisterInstance .

                        o You  must specify WEIGHTED for the value of Routing-
                          Policy .

                        o You can't specify both CNAME for Type  and  settings
                          for  HealthCheckConfig . If you do, the request will
                          fail with an InvalidInput error.

                          SRV

                        Route 53 returns the value  for  an  SRV  record.  The
                        value for an SRV record uses the following values:
                            priority weight port service-hostname

                        Note the following about the values:

                        o The  values of priority and weight are both set to 1
                          and can't be changed.

                        o The value of port comes  from  the  value  that  you
                          specify for the AWS_INSTANCE_PORT attribute when you
                          submit a RegisterInstance request.

                        o The value of service-hostname is a concatenation  of
                          the following values:

                          o The value that you specify for InstanceId when you
                            register an instance.

                          o The name of the service.

                          o The name of the namespace.

                        For example, if the value of InstanceId is test ,  the
                        name  of  the service is backend , and the name of the
                        namespace is example.com , the value of  service-host-
                        name is the following:
                            test.backend.example.com

                        If  you  specify  settings for an SRV record, note the
                        following:

                        o If  you  specify  values  for  AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4   ,
                          AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6  , or both in the RegisterInstance
                          request, Cloud Map automatically  creates  A  and/or
                          AAAA records that have the same name as the value of
                          service-hostname in the SRV record. You  can  ignore
                          these records.

                        o If  you're  using  a system that requires a specific
                          SRV format, such as HAProxy, see the Name element in
                          the  documentation  about CreateService for informa-
                          tion about how to specify the correct name format.

                     TTL -> (long)
                        The amount of time, in seconds, that you want DNS  re-
                        solvers to cache the settings for this record.

                        NOTE:
                            Alias records don't include a TTL because Route 53
                            uses the TTL for the Amazon Web Services  resource
                            that an alias record routes traffic to. If you in-
                            clude the AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME  attribute  when  you
                            submit  a  RegisterInstance request, the TTL value
                            is ignored. Always specify a TTL for the  service;
                            you  can  use a service to register instances that
                            create either alias or non-alias records.

          Type -> (string)
              Describes the systems that can be used to discover  the  service
              instances.
                 DNS_HTTP

              The service instances can be discovered using either DNS queries
              or the DiscoverInstances API operation.
                 HTTP

              The service instances can only be discovered using  the  Discov-
              erInstances API operation.
                 DNS

              Reserved.

          HealthCheckConfig -> (structure)
                 Public DNS and HTTP namespaces only. A complex type that con-
                 tains settings for an optional health check. If  you  specify
                 settings  for a health check, Cloud Map associates the health
                 check with the records that you specify in DnsConfig .

              For information about the charges for health checks, see  Amazon
              Route 53 Pricing .

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of health check that you want to create, which indi-
                 cates how Route 53 determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

                 WARNING:
                     You can't change the value of Type  after  you  create  a
                     health check.

                 You can create the following types of health checks:

                 o HTTP  :  Route  53  tries to establish a TCP connection. If
                   successful, Route 53 submits an HTTP request and waits  for
                   an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

                 o HTTPS  :  Route  53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If
                   successful, Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for
                   an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

                 WARNING:
                     If you specify HTTPS for the value of Type , the endpoint
                     must support TLS v1.0 or later.

                 o TCP : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If  you
                   specify  TCP  for  Type , don't specify a value for Resour-
                   cePath .

                 For more information, see How Route 53 Determines Whether  an
                 Endpoint Is Healthy in the Route 53 Developer Guide .

              ResourcePath -> (string)
                 The  path  that  you want Route 53 to request when performing
                 health checks. The path can be any value that  your  endpoint
                 returns  an  HTTP status code of a 2xx or 3xx format for when
                 the   endpoint   is   healthy.    An    example    file    is
                 /docs/route53-health-check.html . Route 53 automatically adds
                 the DNS name for the service. If you don't  specify  a  value
                 for ResourcePath , the default value is / .

                 If  you  specify  TCP for Type , you must not specify a value
                 for ResourcePath .

              FailureThreshold -> (integer)
                 The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must
                 pass or fail for Route 53 to change the current status of the
                 endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or the other  way  around.
                 For  more information, see How Route 53 Determines Whether an
                 Endpoint Is Healthy in the Route 53 Developer Guide .

          HealthCheckCustomConfig -> (structure)
              A complex type that contains information about an optional  cus-
              tom health check.

              WARNING:
                 If  you specify a health check configuration, you can specify
                 either HealthCheckCustomConfig or HealthCheckConfig  but  not
                 both.

              FailureThreshold -> (integer)

                 WARNING:
                     This  parameter  is no longer supported and is always set
                     to 1. Cloud Map waits for approximately 30 seconds  after
                     receiving an UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus request be-
                     fore changing the status of the service instance.

                 The number of 30-second intervals that you want Cloud Map  to
                 wait  after receiving an UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus re-
                 quest before it changes the health status of  a  service  in-
                 stance.

                 Sending a second or subsequent UpdateInstanceCustomHealthSta-
                 tus request with the same value before 30 seconds has  passed
                 doesn't  accelerate the change. Cloud Map still waits 30 sec-
                 onds after the first request to make the change.

          CreateDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the service was created, in  Unix  format
              and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of CreateDate is
              accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value  1516925490.087
              represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              A  unique  string  that  identifies  the request and that allows
              failed requests to be retried without the risk  of  running  the
              operation  twice. CreatorRequestId can be any unique string (for
              example, a date/timestamp).
