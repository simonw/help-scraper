GET-OPERATION()                                                GET-OPERATION()



NAME
       get-operation -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  information  about  any operation that returns an operation ID in
       the response, such as a CreateService request.

       NOTE:
          To get a list of  operations  that  match  specified  criteria,  see
          ListOperations .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-operation
          --operation-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --operation-id (string)
          The ID of the operation that you want to get more information about.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the result of an operation

       The following get-operation example gets the result of an operation.

OUTPUT
       Operation -> (structure)
          A complex type that contains information about the operation.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID of the operation that you want to get information about.

          Type -> (string)
              The name of the operation that's associated with  the  specified
              ID.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the operation. Values include the following:
                 SUBMITTED

              mit a request.
                 PENDING

              Cloud Map is performing the operation.

              The operation succeeded.
                 FAIL

              The operation failed. For the failure reason, see ErrorMessage .

          ErrorMessage -> (string)
              If the value of Status is FAIL , the reason that  the  operation
              failed.

          ErrorCode -> (string)
              The code associated with ErrorMessage . Values for ErrorCode in-
              clude the following:

              o ACCESS_DENIED

              o CANNOT_CREATE_HOSTED_ZONE

              o EXPIRED_TOKEN

              o HOSTED_ZONE_NOT_FOUND

              o INTERNAL_FAILURE

              The date and time  that  the  request  was  submitted,  in  Unix
              date/time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value
              of CreateDate is accurate  to  milliseconds.  For  example,  the
              value   1516925490.087   represents  Friday,  January  26,  2018
