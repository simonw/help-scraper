BATCH-UPSERT-TABLE-ROWS()                            BATCH-UPSERT-TABLE-ROWS()



NAME
       batch-upsert-table-rows -

DESCRIPTION
       The BatchUpsertTableRows API allows you to upsert one or more rows in a
       table. The upsert operation takes a  filter  expression  as  input  and
       evaluates  it to find matching rows on the destination table. If match-
       ing rows are found, it will update the cells in the  matching  rows  to
       new  values  specified in the request. If no matching rows are found, a
       new row is added at the end of the table and the cells in that row  are
       set to the new values specified in the request.

       You  can specify the values to set in some or all of the columns in the
       table for the matching or newly appended rows. If a column is  not  ex-
       plicitly  specified  for a particular row, then that column will not be
       updated for that row. To clear out the data in  a  specific  cell,  you
       need to set the value as an empty string ("").

SYNOPSIS
            batch-upsert-table-rows
          --workbook-id <value>
          --table-id <value>
          --rows-to-upsert <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --workbook-id (string)
          The ID of the workbook where the rows are being upserted.

          If  a  workbook  with  the specified id could not be found, this API
          throws ResourceNotFoundException.

       --table-id (string)
          The ID of the table where the rows are being upserted.

          If a table with the specified id could not be found, this API throws
          ResourceNotFoundException.

       --rows-to-upsert (list)
          The  list  of  rows  to  upsert in the table. Each item in this list
          needs to have a batch item id to uniquely identify  the  element  in
          the request, a filter expression to find the rows to update for that
          element and the cell values to set for each column in  the  upserted
          rows. You need to specify at least one item in this list.

          Note  that  if  one  of  the filter formulas in the request fails to
          evaluate because of an error or one of the column ids in any of  the
          rows  does not exist in the table, then the request fails and no up-
          dates are made to the table.

          (structure)
              Data needed to upsert rows in a table as part of a  single  item
              in the BatchUpsertTableRows request.

              batchItemId -> (string)
                 An  external  identifier that represents a single item in the
                 request that is being upserted as part  of  the  BatchUpsert-
                 TableRows request. This can be any string that you can use to
                 identify the item in the  request.  The  BatchUpsertTableRows
                 API  puts  the  batch  item id in the results to allow you to
                 link data in the request to data in the results.

              filter -> (structure)
                 The filter formula to use to find existing matching  rows  to
                 update. The formula needs to return zero or more rows. If the
                 formula returns 0 rows, then a new row will  be  appended  in
                 the  target  table.  If the formula returns one or more rows,
                 then the returned rows will be updated.

                 Note that the filter formula needs to return  rows  from  the
                 target table for the upsert operation to succeed. If the fil-
                 ter formula has a syntax error or it doesn't evaluate to zero
                 or  more rows in the target table for any one item in the in-
                 put list, then the entire BatchUpsertTableRows request  fails
                 and no updates are made to the table.

                 formula -> (string)
                     A  formula  representing  a  filter function that returns
                     zero or more matching rows from a table.  Valid  formulas
                     in  this  field  return  a list of rows from a table. The
                     most common ways of writing a formula to return a list of
                     rows  are to use the FindRow() or Filter() functions. Any
                     other formula that returns zero or more rows is also  ac-
                     ceptable.  For example, you can use a formula that points
                     to a cell that contains a filter function.

                 contextRowId -> (string)
                     The optional contextRowId attribute can be used to  spec-
                     ify  the  row id of the context row if the filter formula
                     contains unqualified  references  to  table  columns  and
                     needs a context row to evaluate them successfully.

              cellsToUpdate -> (map)
                 A  map representing the cells to update for the matching rows
                 or an appended row. The key is the column id of the cell  and
                 the value is the CellInput object that represents the data to
                 set in that cell.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     CellInput object contains the data needed  to  create  or
                     update cells in a table.

                     NOTE:
                        CellInput  object  has  only  a  facts field or a fact
                        field, but not both. A 400 bad request will be  thrown
                        if both fact and facts field are present.

                     fact -> (string)
                        Fact  represents the data that is entered into a cell.
                        This data can be free text or a formula. Formulas need
                        to start with the equals (=) sign.

                     facts -> (list)
                        A list representing the values that are entered into a
                        ROWSET cell. Facts list can have either only values or
                        rowIDs, and rowIDs should from the same table.

                        (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          batchItemId=string,filter={formula=string,contextRowId=string},cellsToUpdate={KeyName1={fact=string,facts=[string,string]},KeyName2={fact=string,facts=[string,string]}} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "batchItemId": "string",
              "filter": {
                "formula": "string",
                "contextRowId": "string"
              },
              "cellsToUpdate": {"string": {
                    "fact": "string",
                    "facts": ["string", ...]
                  }
                ...}
            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-request-token (string)
          The  request  token for performing the update action. Request tokens
          help to identify duplicate requests. If a call times  out  or  fails
          due  to  a transient error like a failed network connection, you can
          retry the call with the same request token. The service ensures that
          if  the  first  call  using  that request token is successfully per-
          formed, the second call will not perform the action again.

          Note that request tokens are valid only for a few minutes. You  can-
          not use request tokens to dedupe requests spanning hours or days.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       rows -> (map)
          A map with the batch item id as the key and the result of the upsert
          operation as the value. The result of the upsert operation specifies
          whether existing rows were updated or a new row was appended,  along
          with the list of row ids that were affected.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              An  object that represents the result of a single upsert row re-
              quest.

              rowIds -> (list)
                 The list of row ids that were changed as part  of  an  upsert
                 row operation. If the upsert resulted in an update, this list
                 could potentially contain multiple rows that matched the fil-
                 ter  and  hence got updated. If the upsert resulted in an ap-
                 pend, this list would only have the single row that  was  ap-
                 pended.

                 (string)

              upsertAction -> (string)
                 The result of the upsert action.

       workbookCursor -> (long)
          The  updated workbook cursor after updating or appending rows in the
          table.

       failedBatchItems -> (list)
          The list of batch items in the request that could not be updated  or
          appended  in  the table. Each element in this list contains one item
          from the request that could not be updated in the table  along  with
          the reason why that item could not be updated or appended.

          (structure)
              A single item in a batch that failed to perform the intended ac-
              tion because of an error preventing it from succeeding.

              id -> (string)
                 The id of the batch item that failed. This is the batch  item
                 id  for the BatchCreateTableRows and BatchUpsertTableRows op-
                 erations and the row  id  for  the  BatchUpdateTableRows  and
                 BatchDeleteTableRows operations.

              errorMessage -> (string)
                 The error message that indicates why the batch item failed.
