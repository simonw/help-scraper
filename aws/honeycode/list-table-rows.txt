LIST-TABLE-ROWS()                                            LIST-TABLE-ROWS()



NAME
       list-table-rows -

DESCRIPTION
       The  ListTableRows API allows you to retrieve a list of all the rows in
       a table in a workbook.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-table-rows is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: rows

OPTIONS
       --workbook-id (string)
          The  ID of the workbook that contains the table whose rows are being
          retrieved.

          If a workbook with the specified id could not  be  found,  this  API
          throws ResourceNotFoundException.

       --table-id (string)
          The ID of the table whose rows are being retrieved.

          If a table with the specified id could not be found, this API throws
          ResourceNotFoundException.

       --row-ids (list)
          This parameter is optional. If one or more row ids are specified  in
          this  list,  then only the specified row ids are returned in the re-
          sult. If no row ids are specified here, then all the rows in the ta-
          ble are returned.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       columnIds -> (list)
          The  list  of columns in the table whose row data is returned in the
          result.

          (string)

       rows -> (list)
          The list of rows in the table. Note that this result  is  paginated,
          so this list contains a maximum of 100 rows.

          (structure)
              An object that contains attributes about a single row in a table

              rowId -> (string)
                 The id of the row in the table.

              cells -> (list)
                 A  list  of  cells  in the table row. The cells appear in the
                 same order as the columns of the table.

                 (structure)
                     An object that represents a single cell in a table.

                     formula -> (string)
                        The formula contained in the cell. This field is empty
                        if a cell does not have a formula.

                     format -> (string)
                        The  format  of the cell. If this field is empty, then
                        the format is either not specified in the workbook  or
                        the format is set to AUTO.

                     rawValue -> (string)
                        The  raw  value of the data contained in the cell. The
                        raw value depends on the format of  the  data  in  the
                        cell. However the attribute in the API return value is
                        always a string containing the raw value.

                        Cells with format DATE, DATE_TIME or TIME have the raw
                        value  as a floating point number where the whole num-
                        ber represents the number of days since  1/1/1900  and
                        the fractional part represents the fraction of the day
                        since  midnight.  For  example,  a  cell   with   date
                        11/3/2020  has  the raw value "44138". A cell with the
                        time 9:00 AM has the raw value "0.375" and a cell with
                        date/time value of 11/3/2020 9:00 AM has the raw value
                        "44138.375". Notice that even though the raw value  is
                        a  number  in all three cases, it is still represented
                        as a string.

                        Cells with format NUMBER, CURRENCY, PERCENTAGE and AC-
                        COUNTING  have the raw value of the data as the number
                        representing the data being  displayed.  For  example,
                        the number 1.325 with two decimal places in the format
                        will have it's raw  value  as  "1.325"  and  formatted
                        value  as  "1.33".  A currency value for $10 will have
                        the raw value as "10" and formatted value as "$10.00".
                        A  value  representing  20% with two decimal places in
                        the format will have its raw value as  "0.2"  and  the
                        formatted  value  as  "20.00%". An accounting value of
                        -$25 will have "-25" as the raw value and "$  (25.00)"
                        as the formatted value.

                        Cells  with  format TEXT will have the raw text as the
                        raw value. For example, a cell with text "John  Smith"
                        will  have  "John Smith" as both the raw value and the
                        formatted value.

                        Cells with format CONTACT will have the  name  of  the
                        contact  as a formatted value and the email address of
                        the contact as the raw value. For example,  a  contact
                        for John Smith will have "John Smith" as the formatted
                        value and "john.smith@example.com" as the raw value.

                        Cells with format ROWLINK (aka picklist) will have the
                        first  column of the linked row as the formatted value
                        and the row id of the linked row as the raw value. For
                        example,  a cell containing a picklist to a table that
                        displays task status might  have  "Completed"  as  the
                        formatted         value         and         "row:dfce-
                        faee-5b37-4355-8f28-40c3e4ff5dd4/ca432b2f-b8eb-431d-9fb5-cbe0342f9f03"
                        as the raw value.

                        Cells   with   format   ROWSET  (aka  multi-select  or
                        multi-record picklist) will by default have the  first
                        column  of  each  of  the linked rows as the formatted
                        value in the list, and the rowset  id  of  the  linked
                        rows  as the raw value. For example, a cell containing
                        a multi-select picklist to a table that contains items
                        might  have  "Item A", "Item B" in the formatted value
                        list  and  "rows:b742c1f4-6cb0-4650-a845-35eb86fcc2bb/
                        [fdea123b-8f68-474a-aa8a-5ff87aa333af,6daf41f0-a138-4eee-89da-123086d36ecf]"
                        as the raw value.

                        Cells with format ATTACHMENT will have the name of the
                        attachment  as  the formatted value and the attachment
                        id as the raw value. For example, a cell containing an
                        attachment  named  "image.jpeg" will have "image.jpeg"
                        as    the     formatted     value     and     "attach-
                        ment:ca432b2f-b8eb-431d-9fb5-cbe0342f9f03"  as the raw
                        value.

                        Cells with format AUTO or  cells  without  any  format
                        that  are  auto-detected  as  one of the formats above
                        will contain the raw and formatted values as mentioned
                        above, based on the auto-detected formats. If there is
                        no auto-detected format, the raw and formatted  values
                        will be the same as the data in the cell.

                     formattedValue -> (string)
                        The  formatted  value  of  the cell. This is the value
                        that you see displayed in the cell in the UI.

                        Note that the formatted value of a cell is always rep-
                        resented  as a string irrespective of the data that is
                        stored in the cell. For example, if a cell contains  a
                        date,  the  formatted  value of the cell is the string
                        representation of the formatted date  being  shown  in
                        the  cell in the UI. See details in the rawValue field
                        below for how cells of  different  formats  will  have
                        different raw and formatted values.

                     formattedValues -> (list)
                        A  list of formatted values of the cell. This field is
                        only returned when the  cell  is  ROWSET  format  (aka
                        multi-select  or multi-record picklist). Values in the
                        list are always represented as strings. The formatted-
                        Value field will be empty if this field is returned.

                        (string)

       rowIdsNotFound -> (list)
          The  list  of row ids included in the request that were not found in
          the table.

          (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          Provides the pagination token to load the next  page  if  there  are
          more  results  matching  the  request.  If a pagination token is not
          present in the response, it means that all data matching the request
          has been loaded.

       workbookCursor -> (long)
          Indicates  the  cursor of the workbook at which the data returned by
          this request is read. Workbook cursor keeps  increasing  with  every
          update and the increments are not sequential.
