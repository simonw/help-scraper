BATCH-DELETE-TABLE-ROWS()                            BATCH-DELETE-TABLE-ROWS()



NAME
       batch-delete-table-rows -

DESCRIPTION
       The BatchDeleteTableRows API allows you to delete one or more rows from
       a table in a workbook. You need to specify the ids of the rows that you
       want to delete from the table.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-delete-table-rows
          --workbook-id <value>
          --table-id <value>
          --row-ids <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --workbook-id (string)
          The ID of the workbook where the rows are being deleted.

          If  a  workbook  with  the specified id could not be found, this API
          throws ResourceNotFoundException.

       --table-id (string)
          The ID of the table where the rows are being deleted.

          If a table with the specified id could not be found, this API throws
          ResourceNotFoundException.

       --row-ids (list)
          The list of row ids to delete from the table. You need to specify at
          least one row id in this list.

          Note that if one of the row ids provided in the request does not ex-
          ist  in  the  table,  then the request fails and no rows are deleted
          from the table.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --client-request-token (string)
          The request token for performing the delete action.  Request  tokens
          help  to  identify  duplicate requests. If a call times out or fails
          due to a transient error like a failed network connection,  you  can
          retry the call with the same request token. The service ensures that
          if the first call using that  request  token  is  successfully  per-
          formed, the second call will not perform the action again.

          Note  that request tokens are valid only for a few minutes. You can-
          not use request tokens to dedupe requests spanning hours or days.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       workbookCursor -> (long)
          The updated workbook cursor after deleting the rows from the table.

       failedBatchItems -> (list)
          The list of row ids in the request that could not  be  deleted  from
          the  table.  Each  element in this list contains one row id from the
          request that could not be deleted along with  the  reason  why  that
          item could not be deleted.

          (structure)
              A single item in a batch that failed to perform the intended ac-
              tion because of an error preventing it from succeeding.

              id -> (string)
                 The id of the batch item that failed. This is the batch  item
                 id  for the BatchCreateTableRows and BatchUpsertTableRows op-
                 erations and the row  id  for  the  BatchUpdateTableRows  and
                 BatchDeleteTableRows operations.

              errorMessage -> (string)
                 The error message that indicates why the batch item failed.
