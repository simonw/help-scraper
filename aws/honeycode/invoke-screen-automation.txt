INVOKE-SCREEN-AUTOMATION()                          INVOKE-SCREEN-AUTOMATION()



NAME
       invoke-screen-automation -

DESCRIPTION
       The  InvokeScreenAutomation  API allows invoking an action defined in a
       screen in a Honeycode app. The  API  allows  setting  local  variables,
       which can then be used in the automation being invoked. This allows au-
       tomating the Honeycode app interactions to write, update or delete data
       in the workbook.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            invoke-screen-automation
          --workbook-id <value>
          --app-id <value>
          --screen-id <value>
          --screen-automation-id <value>
          [--variables <value>]
          [--row-id <value>]
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --workbook-id (string)
          The ID of the workbook that contains the screen automation.

       --app-id (string)
          The ID of the app that contains the screen automation.

       --screen-id (string)
          The ID of the screen that contains the screen automation.

       --screen-automation-id (string)
          The ID of the automation action to be performed.

       --variables (map)
          Variables  are  specified  as a map where the key is the name of the
          variable as defined on the screen. The value is an object which cur-
          rently has only one property, rawValue, which holds the value of the
          variable to be passed to the screen.  Any  variables  defined  in  a
          screen are required to be passed in the call.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              The input variables to the app to be used by the InvokeScreenAu-
              tomation action request.

              rawValue -> (string)
                 Raw value of the variable.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=rawValue=string,KeyName2=rawValue=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {
                "rawValue": "string"
              }
            ...}

       --row-id (string)
          The row ID for the automation if the automation is defined inside  a
          block with source or list.

       --client-request-token (string)
          The  request token for performing the automation action. Request to-
          kens help to identify duplicate requests. If a  call  times  out  or
          fails due to a transient error like a failed network connection, you
          can retry the call with the same request token. The service  ensures
          that if the first call using that request token is successfully per-
          formed, the second call will return the  response  of  the  previous
          call rather than performing the action again.

          Note  that request tokens are valid only for a few minutes. You can-
          not use request tokens to dedupe requests spanning hours or days.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       workbookCursor -> (long)
          The updated workbook cursor after performing the automation action.
