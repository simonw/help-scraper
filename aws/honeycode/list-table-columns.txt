LIST-TABLE-COLUMNS()                                      LIST-TABLE-COLUMNS()



NAME
       list-table-columns -

DESCRIPTION
       The  ListTableColumns API allows you to retrieve a list of all the col-
       umns in a table in a workbook.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-table-columns is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: tableColumns

SYNOPSIS
            list-table-columns
          --workbook-id <value>
          --table-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --workbook-id (string)
          The ID of the workbook that contains the table whose columns are be-
          ing retrieved.

          If a workbook with the specified id could not  be  found,  this  API
          throws ResourceNotFoundException.

       --table-id (string)
          The ID of the table whose columns are being retrieved.

          If a table with the specified id could not be found, this API throws
          ResourceNotFoundException.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       tableColumns -> (list)
          The list of columns in the table.

          (structure)
              An object that contains attributes about a single  column  in  a
              table

              tableColumnId -> (string)
                 The id of the column in the table.

              tableColumnName -> (string)
                 The name of the column in the table.

              format -> (string)
                 The  column  level  format  that  is applied in the table. An
                 empty value in this field means that the column format is the
                 default value 'AUTO'.

       nextToken -> (string)
          Provides  the  pagination  token  to load the next page if there are
          more results matching the request. If  a  pagination  token  is  not
          present in the response, it means that all data matching the request
          has been loaded.

       workbookCursor -> (long)
          Indicates the cursor of the workbook at which the data  returned  by
          this  request  is  read. Workbook cursor keeps increasing with every
          update and the increments are not sequential.
