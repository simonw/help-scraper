NAME
       compute-optimizer -

DESCRIPTION
       Compute Optimizer is a service that analyzes the configuration and uti-
       lization metrics of your Amazon Web Services compute resources, such as
       Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, Lambda functions,
       and Amazon EBS volumes. It reports whether your resources are  optimal,
       and  generates  optimization recommendations to reduce the cost and im-
       prove the performance of your workloads. Compute  Optimizer  also  pro-
       vides recent utilization metric data, in addition to projected utiliza-
       tion metric data for the recommendations, which you can use to evaluate
       which recommendation provides the best price-performance trade-off. The
       analysis of your usage patterns can help you decide when to move or re-
       size your running resources, and still meet your performance and capac-
       ity requirements. For more information about Compute Optimizer, includ-
       ing  the required permissions to use the service, see the Compute Opti-
       mizer User Guide .
