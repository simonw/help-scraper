NAME
       get-signaling-channel-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  an  endpoint  for the specified signaling channel to send and
       receive messages. This API uses the SingleMasterChannelEndpointConfigu-
       ration  input parameter, which consists of the Protocols and Role prop-
       erties.
          Protocols is used to determine the communication mechanism. For  ex-
          ample,  if  you specify WSS as the protocol, this API produces a se-
          cure websocket endpoint. If you specify HTTPS as the protocol,  this
          API generates an HTTPS endpoint.

          Role  determines the messaging permissions. A MASTER role results in
          this API generating an endpoint that a client can use to communicate
          with  any  of  the  viewers on the channel. A VIEWER role results in
          this API generating an endpoint that a client can use to communicate
          only with a MASTER .

SYNOPSIS
            get-signaling-channel-endpoint
          --channel-arn <value>
          [--single-master-channel-endpoint-configuration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the signalling channel for which
          you want to get an endpoint.

       --single-master-channel-endpoint-configuration (structure)
          A structure containing  the  endpoint  configuration  for  the  SIN-
          GLE_MASTER channel type.

          Protocols -> (list)
              This  property  is used to determine the nature of communication
              over this SINGLE_MASTER signaling channel. If WSS is  specified,
              this  API  returns  a websocket endpoint. If HTTPS is specified,
              this API returns an HTTPS endpoint.

              (string)

          Role -> (string)
              This property is used to determine messaging permissions in this
              SINGLE_MASTER  signaling  channel.  If MASTER is specified, this
              API returns an endpoint that a client can use to receive  offers
              from  and  send  answers to any of the viewers on this signaling
              channel. If VIEWER is specified, this API  returns  an  endpoint
              that  a  client  can  use  only to send offers to another MASTER
              client on this signaling channel.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Protocols=string,string,Role=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Protocols": ["WSS"|"HTTPS", ...],
            "Role": "MASTER"|"VIEWER"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ResourceEndpointList -> (list)
          A list of endpoints for the specified signaling channel.

          (structure)
              An  object  that describes the endpoint of the signaling channel
              returned by the GetSignalingChannelEndpoint API.

              Protocol -> (string)
                 The protocol of the signaling channel returned by the GetSig-
                 nalingChannelEndpoint API.

              ResourceEndpoint -> (string)
                 The endpoint of the signaling channel returned by the GetSig-
                 nalingChannelEndpoint API.
