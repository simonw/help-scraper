CREATE-STREAM()                                                CREATE-STREAM()



NAME
       create-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new Kinesis video stream.

       When  you  create a new stream, Kinesis Video Streams assigns it a ver-
       sion number. When you  change  the  stream's  metadata,  Kinesis  Video
       Streams updates the version.
          CreateStream is an asynchronous operation.

       For information about how the service works, see How it Works .

       You must have permissions for the KinesisVideo:CreateStream action.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-stream
          [--device-name <value>]
          --stream-name <value>
          [--media-type <value>]
          [--kms-key-id <value>]
          [--data-retention-in-hours <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --device-name (string)
          The name of the device that is writing to the stream.

          NOTE:
              In  the  current  implementation, Kinesis Video Streams does not
              use this name.

       --stream-name (string)
          A name for the stream that you are creating.

          The stream name is an identifier for the stream, and must be  unique
          for each account and region.

       --media-type (string)
          The  media  type of the stream. Consumers of the stream can use this
          information when processing the stream. For more  information  about
          media  types,  see  Media Types . If you choose to specify the Medi-
          aType , see Naming Requirements for guidelines.

          Example  valid  values  include  "video/h264"  and   "video/h264,au-
          dio/aac".

          This  parameter  is optional; the default value is null (or empty in
          JSON).

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The ID of the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key that you want
          Kinesis Video Streams to use to encrypt stream data.

          If  no  key  ID is specified, the default, Kinesis Video-managed key
          (aws/kinesisvideo ) is used.

          For more information, see DescribeKey .

       --data-retention-in-hours (integer)
          The number of hours that you want to retain the data in the  stream.
          Kinesis Video Streams retains the data in a data store that is asso-
          ciated with the stream.

          The default value is 0, indicating that the stream does not  persist
          data.

          When  the  DataRetentionInHours value is 0, consumers can still con-
          sume the fragments that remain in the service host buffer, which has
          a  retention time limit of 5 minutes and a retention memory limit of
          200 MB. Fragments are removed from the buffer when either  limit  is
          reached.

       --tags (map)
          A list of tags to associate with the specified stream. Each tag is a
          key-value pair (the value is optional).

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       StreamARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stream.
