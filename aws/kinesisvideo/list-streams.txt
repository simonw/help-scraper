LIST-STREAMS()                                                  LIST-STREAMS()



NAME
       list-streams -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns an array of StreamInfo objects. Each object describes a stream.
       To retrieve only streams that satisfy a  specific  condition,  you  can
       specify a StreamNameCondition .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-streams is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: StreamInfoList

SYNOPSIS
            list-streams
          [--stream-name-condition <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stream-name-condition (structure)
          Optional: Returns only streams that satisfy  a  specific  condition.
          Currently,  you  can  specify  only the prefix of a stream name as a
          condition.

          ComparisonOperator -> (string)
              A comparison operator. Currently, you can specify only  the  BE-
              GINS_WITH operator, which finds streams whose names start with a
              given prefix.

          ComparisonValue -> (string)
              A value to compare.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ComparisonOperator=string,ComparisonValue=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ComparisonOperator": "BEGINS_WITH",
            "ComparisonValue": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       StreamInfoList -> (list)
          An array of StreamInfo objects.

          (structure)
              An object describing a Kinesis video stream.

              DeviceName -> (string)
                 The name of the device that is associated with the stream.

              StreamName -> (string)
                 The name of the stream.

              StreamARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stream.

              MediaType -> (string)
                 The MediaType of the stream.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The ID of the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)  key  that
                 Kinesis Video Streams uses to encrypt data on the stream.

              Version -> (string)
                 The version of the stream.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the stream.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A time stamp that indicates when the stream was created.

              DataRetentionInHours -> (integer)
                 How long the stream retains data, in hours.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  response is truncated, the call returns this element with a
          token. To get the next batch of streams, use this token in your next
          request.
