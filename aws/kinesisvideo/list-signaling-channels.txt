LIST-SIGNALING-CHANNELS()                            LIST-SIGNALING-CHANNELS()



NAME
       list-signaling-channels -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  an  array of ChannelInfo objects. Each object describes a sig-
       naling channel. To retrieve only those channels that satisfy a specific
       condition, you can specify a ChannelNameCondition .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-signaling-channels  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: ChannelInfoList

SYNOPSIS
            list-signaling-channels
          [--channel-name-condition <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-name-condition (structure)
          Optional: Returns only the channels that satisfy a  specific  condi-
          tion.

          ComparisonOperator -> (string)
              A  comparison  operator. Currently, you can only specify the BE-
              GINS_WITH operator, which finds signaling channels  whose  names
              begin with a given prefix.

          ComparisonValue -> (string)
              A value to compare.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ComparisonOperator=string,ComparisonValue=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ComparisonOperator": "BEGINS_WITH",
            "ComparisonValue": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ChannelInfoList -> (list)
          An array of ChannelInfo objects.

          (structure)
              A structure that encapsulates a signaling channel's metadata and
              properties.

              ChannelName -> (string)
                 The name of the signaling channel.

              ChannelARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the signaling channel.

              ChannelType -> (string)
                 The type of the signaling channel.

              ChannelStatus -> (string)
                 Current status of the signaling channel.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the signaling channel was created.

              SingleMasterConfiguration -> (structure)
                 A structure that contains  the  configuration  for  the  SIN-
                 GLE_MASTER channel type.

                 MessageTtlSeconds -> (integer)
                     The  period of time a signaling channel retains underliv-
                     ered messages before they are discarded.

              Version -> (string)
                 The current version of the signaling channel.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, the call returns this element  with  a
          token. To get the next batch of streams, use this token in your next
          request.
