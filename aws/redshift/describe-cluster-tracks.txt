DESCRIBE-CLUSTER-TRACKS()                            DESCRIBE-CLUSTER-TRACKS()



NAME
       describe-cluster-tracks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of all the available maintenance tracks.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-cluster-tracks  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: MaintenanceTracks

SYNOPSIS
            describe-cluster-tracks
          [--maintenance-track-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --maintenance-track-name (string)
          The name of the maintenance track.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       MaintenanceTracks -> (list)
          A list of maintenance tracks output by the DescribeClusterTracks op-
          eration.

          (structure)
              Defines  a  maintenance  track that determines which Amazon Red-
              shift version to apply during a maintenance window. If the value
              for  MaintenanceTrack is current , the cluster is updated to the
              most recently certified maintenance release.  If  the  value  is
              trailing  ,  the  cluster is updated to the previously certified
              maintenance release.

              MaintenanceTrackName -> (string)
                 The name of the maintenance track. Possible values  are  cur-
                 rent and trailing .

              DatabaseVersion -> (string)
                 The version number for the cluster release.

              UpdateTargets -> (list)
                 An  array of  UpdateTarget objects to update with the mainte-
                 nance track.

                 (structure)
                     A maintenance track that you can switch the current track
                     to.

                     MaintenanceTrackName -> (string)
                        The name of the new maintenance track.

                     DatabaseVersion -> (string)
                        The cluster version for the new maintenance track.

                     SupportedOperations -> (list)
                        A  list  of  operations  supported  by the maintenance
                        track.

                        (structure)
                            Describes the operations that  are  allowed  on  a
                            maintenance track.

                            OperationName -> (string)

       Marker -> (string)
          The  starting  point  to return a set of response tracklist records.
          You can retrieve the next set of response records by  providing  the
          returned  marker  value in the Marker parameter and retrying the re-
          quest.
