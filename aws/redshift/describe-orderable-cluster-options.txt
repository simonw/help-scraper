DESCRIBE-ORDERABLE-CLUSTER-OPTIONS()      DESCRIBE-ORDERABLE-CLUSTER-OPTIONS()



NAME
       describe-orderable-cluster-options -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of orderable cluster options. Before you create a new
       cluster you can use this operation to find what options are  available,
       such as the EC2 Availability Zones (AZ) in the specific Amazon Web Ser-
       vices Region that you can specify, and the node types you can  request.
       The node types differ by available storage, memory, CPU and price. With
       the cost involved you might want to obtain a list of cluster options in
       the  specific  region  and  specify values when creating a cluster. For
       more information about managing clusters, go to Amazon  Redshift  Clus-
       ters in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-orderable-cluster-options  is  a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: OrderableClusterOptions

SYNOPSIS
            describe-orderable-cluster-options
          [--cluster-version <value>]
          [--node-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-version (string)
          The version filter value. Specify this parameter to  show  only  the
          available offerings matching the specified version.

          Default: All versions.

          Constraints: Must be one of the version returned from  DescribeClus-
          terVersions .

       --node-type (string)
          The node type filter value. Specify this parameter to show only  the
          available offerings matching the specified node type.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       OrderableClusterOptions -> (list)
          An OrderableClusterOption structure containing information about or-
          derable options for the cluster.

          (structure)
              Describes an orderable cluster option.

              ClusterVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the orderable cluster.

              ClusterType -> (string)
                 The cluster type, for example multi-node .

              NodeType -> (string)
                 The node type for the orderable cluster.

              AvailabilityZones -> (list)
                 A list of availability zones for the orderable cluster.

                 (structure)
                     Describes an availability zone.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the availability zone.

                     SupportedPlatforms -> (list)

                            ters.

                            Name -> (string)

       Marker -> (string)
          A  value  that  indicates the starting point for the next set of re-
          sponse records in a subsequent request. If a value is returned in  a
          response, you can retrieve the next set of records by providing this
          returned marker value in the Marker parameter and retrying the  com-
          mand.  If  the Marker field is empty, all response records have been
          retrieved for the request.
