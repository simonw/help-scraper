DESCRIBE-CLUSTERS()                                        DESCRIBE-CLUSTERS()



NAME
       describe-clusters -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  properties  of  provisioned clusters including general cluster
       properties, cluster database properties, maintenance and backup proper-
       ties, and security and access properties. This operation supports pagi-
       nation. For more information about managing clusters, go to Amazon Red-
       shift Clusters in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide .

       If you specify both tag keys and tag values in the same request, Amazon
       Redshift returns all clusters that match any combination of the  speci-
       fied  keys  and  values. For example, if you have owner and environment
       for tag keys, and admin and test for tag values, all clusters that have
       any combination of those values are returned.

       If  both tag keys and values are omitted from the request, clusters are
       returned regardless of whether they have tag keys or values  associated
       with them.

       describe-clusters  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Clusters

OPTIONS
       --cluster-identifier (string)
          The unique identifier of a cluster whose properties you are request-
          ing. This parameter is case sensitive.

          The  default  is  that  all  clusters defined for an account are re-
          turned.

       --tag-keys (list)
          A tag key or keys for which you want to return all matching clusters
          that  are  associated  with  the specified key or keys. For example,
          suppose that you have clusters that  are  tagged  with  keys  called
          owner and environment . If you specify both of these tag keys in the
          request, Amazon Redshift returns a response with the  clusters  that
          have either or both of these tag keys associated with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tag-values (list)
          A  tag  value  or  values  for which you want to return all matching
          clusters that are associated with the specified tag value or values.
          For  example,  suppose  that  you have clusters that are tagged with
          values called admin and test . If you specify both of these tag val-
          ues  in  the  request,  Amazon  Redshift returns a response with the
          clusters that have either or both of  these  tag  values  associated
          with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)

          returned  marker value in the Marker parameter and retrying the com-
          mand. If the Marker field is empty, all response records  have  been
          retrieved for the request.

                 o Maintenance  -  The cluster is intermittently available for
                   queries due to maintenance activities.

                 o Modifying - The cluster  is  intermittently  available  for

                 The default number of days to retain a  manual  snapshot.  If
                 the  value is -1, the snapshot is retained indefinitely. This
                 setting doesn't change the retention period of existing snap-
                 shots.

                 The  value  must  be  either  -1  or an integer between 1 and

                 Group.Status subelements.

                 Cluster security groups are used when the cluster is not cre-
                 ated in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Clusters  that
                 are  created  in  a  VPC  use  VPC security groups, which are

                 groups  that  are associated with the cluster. This parameter
                 is returned only if the cluster is in a VPC.

                 (structure)
                     Describes the members of a VPC security group.

                     VpcSecurityGroupId -> (string)

                 The list of cluster parameter groups that are associated with
                 this  cluster.  Each  parameter group in the list is returned
