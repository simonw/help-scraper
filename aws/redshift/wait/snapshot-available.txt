SNAPSHOT-AVAILABLE()                                      SNAPSHOT-AVAILABLE()



NAME
       snapshot-available -

DESCRIPTION
       Wait  until JMESPath query Snapshots[].Status returns available for all
       elements when polling with describe-cluster-snapshots. It will poll ev-
       ery  15  seconds  until  a successful state has been reached. This will
       exit with a return code of 255 after 20 failed checks.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       snapshot-available is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Snapshots

OPTIONS
       --cluster-identifier (string)
          The  identifier  of  the cluster which generated the requested snap-
          shots.

       --snapshot-identifier (string)
          The snapshot identifier of the snapshot about which to return infor-
          mation.

       --snapshot-type (string)
          The  type  of snapshots for which you are requesting information. By
          default, snapshots of all types are returned.

          Valid Values: automated | manual

       --start-time (timestamp)
          A value that requests only snapshots created at or after the  speci-
          fied  time. The time value is specified in ISO 8601 format. For more
          information about ISO 8601, go to the ISO8601 Wikipedia page.

          Example: 2012-07-16T18:00:00Z

       --end-time (timestamp)
          A time value that requests only snapshots created at or  before  the
          specified  time. The time value is specified in ISO 8601 format. For
          more information about ISO 8601, go to the ISO8601 Wikipedia page.

          Example: 2012-07-16T18:00:00Z

       --owner-account (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account used to create or copy the snapshot.
          Use this field to filter the results to snapshots owned by a partic-
          ular account. To describe snapshots you  own,  either  specify  your
          Amazon Web Services account, or do not specify the parameter.

       --tag-keys (list)
          A  tag key or keys for which you want to return all matching cluster
          snapshots that are associated with the specified key  or  keys.  For
          example,  suppose  that you have snapshots that are tagged with keys
          called owner and environment . If you specify both of these tag keys
          in  the  request,  Amazon Redshift returns a response with the snap-
          shots that have either or both of these  tag  keys  associated  with
          them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tag-values (list)
          A  tag  value  or  values  for which you want to return all matching
          cluster snapshots that are associated with the specified  tag  value
          or  values.  For  example,  suppose that you have snapshots that are
          tagged with values called admin and test . If you  specify  both  of
          these  tag values in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response
          with the snapshots that have either or both of these tag values  as-
          sociated with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cluster-exists | --no-cluster-exists (boolean)
          A  value  that indicates whether to return snapshots only for an ex-
          isting cluster. You can perform table-level restore only by using  a
          snapshot  of  an  existing  cluster, that is, a cluster that has not
          been deleted. Values for this parameter work as follows:

          o If ClusterExists is set to true , ClusterIdentifier is required.

          o If ClusterExists is set to false and ClusterIdentifier isn't spec-
            ified,  all  snapshots  associated with deleted clusters (orphaned
            snapshots) are returned.

          o If ClusterExists is set to false and ClusterIdentifier  is  speci-
            fied for a deleted cluster, snapshots associated with that cluster
            are returned.

          o If ClusterExists is set to false and ClusterIdentifier  is  speci-
            fied for an existing cluster, no snapshots are returned.

       --sorting-entities (list)
          (structure)
              Describes a sorting entity

              Attribute -> (string)
                 The category for sorting the snapshots.

              SortOrder -> (string)
                 The order for listing the attributes.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Attribute=string,SortOrder=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Attribute": "SOURCE_TYPE"|"TOTAL_SIZE"|"CREATE_TIME",
              "SortOrder": "ASC"|"DESC"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To wait for snapshot to become available

       The following wait snapshot-available example pauses and continues only
       after it can confirm that the specified snapshot is available.

          aws redshift wait snapshot-available \
              --snapshot-identifier mycluster-2019-11-06-16-31

       This command does not produce any output.

OUTPUT
       None
