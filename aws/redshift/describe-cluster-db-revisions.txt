DESCRIBE-CLUSTER-DB-REVISIONS()                DESCRIBE-CLUSTER-DB-REVISIONS()



NAME
       describe-cluster-db-revisions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns an array of ClusterDbRevision objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-cluster-db-revisions  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: ClusterDbRevisions

SYNOPSIS

          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-identifier (string)
          A unique identifier for a cluster whose ClusterDbRevisions  you  are
          requesting.  This  parameter is case sensitive. All clusters defined
          for an account are returned by default.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe DB revisions for a cluster

       The following describe-cluster-db-revisions example  displays  the  de-
       tails  of an array of ClusterDbRevision objects for the specified clus-
       ter.

          aws redshift describe-cluster-db-revisions \
              --cluster-identifier mycluster

       Output:

          {
              "ClusterDbRevisions": [
                  {
                      "ClusterIdentifier": "mycluster",
                      "CurrentDatabaseRevision": "11420",
                      "DatabaseRevisionReleaseDate": "2019-11-22T16:43:49.597Z",
                      "RevisionTargets": []
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          A string representing the starting point for the next set  of  revi-
          sions.  If  a  value is returned in a response, you can retrieve the
          next set of revisions by providing the value in the marker parameter
          and  retrying  the  command. If the marker field is empty, all revi-
          sions have already been returned.

       ClusterDbRevisions -> (list)
          A list of revisions.

          (structure)
              Describes a ClusterDbRevision .

              ClusterIdentifier -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the cluster.

              CurrentDatabaseRevision -> (string)
                 A string representing the current cluster version.

              DatabaseRevisionReleaseDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date on which the database revision was released.

              RevisionTargets -> (list)
                 A list of RevisionTarget objects, where each object describes
                 the database revision that a cluster can be updated to.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a RevisionTarget .

                     DatabaseRevision -> (string)
                        A  unique string that identifies the version to update
                        the cluster to. You can use this value in  ModifyClus-
                        terDbRevision .

                     Description -> (string)
                        A  string that describes the changes and features that
                        will be applied to the cluster when it is  updated  to
                        the corresponding  ClusterDbRevision .

                     DatabaseRevisionReleaseDate -> (timestamp)
                        The date on which the database revision was released.
