NAME
       purchase-reserved-node-offering -

DESCRIPTION
       Allows  you to purchase reserved nodes. Amazon Redshift offers a prede-
       fined set of reserved node offerings. You can purchase one or  more  of
       the  offerings.  You can call the  DescribeReservedNodeOfferings API to
       obtain the available reserved node offerings. You can call this API  by
       providing a specific reserved node offering and the number of nodes you
       want to reserve.

       For more information about reserved node offerings,  go  to  Purchasing
       Reserved Nodes in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            purchase-reserved-node-offering
          --reserved-node-offering-id <value>
          [--node-count <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --reserved-node-offering-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the reserved node offering you want to pur-
          chase.

       --node-count (integer)
          The number of reserved nodes that you want to purchase.

          Default: 1

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

   Purchase a Reserved Node
       This example shows how to purchase a reserved node  offering.  The  re-
       served-node-offering-id    is    obtained   by   calling   describe-re-
       served-node-offerings.

       Command:

          aws redshift purchase-reserved-node-offering --reserved-node-offering-id ceb6a579-cf4c-4343-be8b-d832c45ab51c

       Result:
