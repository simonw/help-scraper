SYNOPSIS
            deauthorize-data-share
          --data-share-arn <value>
          --consumer-identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --data-share-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the datashare to remove authoriza-
          tion from.

       --consumer-identifier (string)
          The  identifier  of  the data consumer that is to have authorization
          removed from the datashare. This identifier is an  Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices account ID or a keyword, such as ADX.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
