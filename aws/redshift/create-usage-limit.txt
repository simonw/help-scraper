NAME
       create-usage-limit -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  usage  limit  for  a specified Amazon Redshift feature on a
       cluster. The usage limit is identified  by  the  returned  usage  limit
       identifier.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-usage-limit

          --feature-type <value>
          --limit-type <value>
          --amount <value>
          [--period <value>]
          [--breach-action <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the cluster that you want to limit usage.

       --feature-type (string)
          The Amazon Redshift feature that you want to limit.

          Possible values:

          o spectrum

          o concurrency-scaling

       --limit-type (string)
          The  type of limit. Depending on the feature type, this can be based
          on a time duration or data size. If FeatureType is spectrum  ,  then
          LimitType must be data-scanned . If FeatureType is concurrency-scal-
          ing , then LimitType must be time .

          Possible values:

          o time

          o data-scanned

       --amount (long)
          The limit amount. If time-based,  this  amount  is  in  minutes.  If
          data-based,  this  amount  is in terabytes (TB). The value must be a
          positive number.

       --period (string)
          The time period that the amount applies to. A weekly  period  begins
          on Sunday. The default is monthly .

          Possible values:

          o daily

          o weekly

          o monthly

       --breach-action (string)
          The action that Amazon Redshift takes when the limit is reached. The
          default is log. For more information about this parameter, see   Us-
          ageLimit .

          Possible values:

          o log

          o emit-metric

          o disable

       --tags (list)
          A list of tag instances.

          (structure)
              A tag consisting of a name/value pair for a resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key, or name, for the resource tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for the resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       UsageLimitId -> (string)
          The identifier of the usage limit.

       ClusterIdentifier -> (string)
          The identifier of the cluster with a usage limit.

       FeatureType -> (string)
          The Amazon Redshift feature to which the limit applies.

       LimitType -> (string)
          The type of limit. Depending on the feature type, this can be  based
          on a time duration or data size.

       Amount -> (long)
          The  limit  amount.  If  time-based,  this  amount is in minutes. If
          data-based, this amount is in terabytes (TB).

       Period -> (string)
          The time period that the amount applies to. A weekly  period  begins
          on Sunday. The default is monthly .

          The  action  that  Amazon  Redshift takes when the limit is reached.
          Possible values are:

          o log - To log an event in a system table. The default is log.

          o emit-metric - To emit CloudWatch metrics.

          o disable - To disable the feature until the next usage  period  be-
            gins.

       Tags -> (list)
          A list of tag instances.

          (structure)
              A tag consisting of a name/value pair for a resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key, or name, for the resource tag.
