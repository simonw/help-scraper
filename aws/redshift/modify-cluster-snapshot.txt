NAME
       modify-cluster-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies the settings for a snapshot.

       This  exanmple modifies the manual retention period setting for a clus-
       ter snapshot.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-cluster-snapshot
          --snapshot-identifier <value>
          [--manual-snapshot-retention-period <value>]
          [--force | --no-force]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the snapshot whose setting you want to modify.

       --manual-snapshot-retention-period (integer)
          The number of days that a manual snapshot is retained. If the  value
          is -1, the manual snapshot is retained indefinitely.

          If  the  manual  snapshot falls outside of the new retention period,
          you can specify the force option to immediately delete the snapshot.

          The value must be either -1 or an integer between 1 and 3,653.

       --force | --no-force (boolean)
          A Boolean option to override an exception if  the  retention  period
          has already passed.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To modify cluster snapshot

       The following modify-cluster-snapshot example sets the manual retention
       period setting for the specified cluster snapshot to value of 10 days.

          aws redshift modify-cluster-snapshot \
              --snapshot-identifier mycluster-2019-11-06-16-32 \
              --manual-snapshot-retention-period 10

              An  option that specifies whether to create the cluster with en-
              hanced VPC routing enabled. To create a cluster  that  uses  en-
              hanced  VPC  routing, the cluster must be in a VPC. For more in-
              formation, see Enhanced VPC Routing in the Amazon Redshift Clus-
              ter Management Guide.

              If this option is true , enhanced VPC routing is enabled.

          ManualSnapshotRemainingDays -> (integer)
              The number of days until a manual snapshot will pass its  reten-
              tion period.
