DESCRIBE-CLUSTER-SUBNET-GROUPS()              DESCRIBE-CLUSTER-SUBNET-GROUPS()



NAME
       describe-cluster-subnet-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  one  or more cluster subnet group objects, which contain meta-
       data about your cluster subnet groups. By default, this  operation  re-
       turns  information  about all cluster subnet groups that are defined in
       your Amazon Web Services account.

       If you specify both tag keys and tag values in the same request, Amazon
       Redshift  returns  all  subnet groups that match any combination of the
       specified keys and values. For example, if you have owner and  environ-
       ment for tag keys, and admin and test for tag values, all subnet groups
       that have any combination of those values are returned.

       If both tag keys and values are omitted from the request, subnet groups
       are returned regardless of whether they have tag keys or values associ-
       ated with them.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-cluster-subnet-groups is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: ClusterSubnetGroups

SYNOPSIS
            describe-cluster-subnet-groups
          [--cluster-subnet-group-name <value>]
          [--tag-keys <value>]
          [--tag-values <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-subnet-group-name (string)
          The  name  of  the cluster subnet group for which information is re-
          quested.

       --tag-keys (list)
          A tag key or keys for which you want to return all matching  cluster
          subnet  groups  that  are associated with the specified key or keys.
          For example, suppose that you have subnet  groups  that  are  tagged
          with  keys  called  owner  and  environment . If you specify both of
          these tag keys in the request, Amazon Redshift  returns  a  response
          with  the  subnet  groups that have either or both of these tag keys
          associated with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tag-values (list)
          A tag value or values for which you  want  to  return  all  matching
          cluster  subnet  groups  that  are associated with the specified tag
          value or values. For example, suppose that you  have  subnet  groups
          that  are  tagged with values called admin and test . If you specify
          both of these tag values in the request, Amazon Redshift  returns  a
          response  with  the  subnet groups that have either or both of these
          tag values associated with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)

          returned  marker value in the Marker parameter and retrying the com-
          mand. If the Marker field is empty, all response records  have  been
          retrieved for the request.
