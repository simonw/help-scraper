CANCEL-RESIZE()                                                CANCEL-RESIZE()



NAME
       cancel-resize -

DESCRIPTION
       Cancels a resize operation for a cluster.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            cancel-resize
          --cluster-identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-identifier (string)
          The  unique identifier for the cluster that you want to cancel a re-
          size operation for.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To cancel resize of a cluster

       The following cancel-resize example cancels a classic resize  operation
       for a cluster.

          aws redshift cancel-resize \
              --cluster-identifier mycluster

       Output:

          {
              "TargetNodeType": "dc2.large",
              "TargetNumberOfNodes": 2,
              "TargetClusterType": "multi-node",
              "Status": "CANCELLING",
              "ResizeType": "ClassicResize",
              "TargetEncryptionType": "NONE"
          }

       For  more  information, see Resizing Clusters in Amazon Redshift in the
       Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide.

OUTPUT
       TargetNodeType -> (string)
          The node type that the cluster will have after the resize  operation
          is complete.

       TargetNumberOfNodes -> (integer)
          The  number of nodes that the cluster will have after the resize op-
          eration is complete.

       TargetClusterType -> (string)
          The cluster type after the resize operation is complete.

          Valid Values: multi-node | single-node

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the resize operation.

          Valid Values: NONE | IN_PROGRESS | FAILED | SUCCEEDED | CANCELLING

       ImportTablesCompleted -> (list)
          The names of tables that have been completely imported .

          Valid Values: List of table names.

          (string)

       ImportTablesInProgress -> (list)
          The names of tables that are being currently imported.

          Valid Values: List of table names.

          (string)

       ImportTablesNotStarted -> (list)
          The names of tables that have not been yet imported.

          Valid Values: List of table names

          (string)

       AvgResizeRateInMegaBytesPerSecond -> (double)
          The average rate of the resize operation over the last few  minutes,
          measured  in  megabytes  per second. After the resize operation com-
          pletes, this value shows the average rate of the entire resize oper-
          ation.

       TotalResizeDataInMegaBytes -> (long)
          The estimated total amount of data, in megabytes, on the cluster be-
          fore the resize operation began.

       ProgressInMegaBytes -> (long)
          While the resize operation is in progress, this value shows the cur-
          rent  amount  of data, in megabytes, that has been processed so far.
          When the resize operation is complete, this value  shows  the  total
          amount  of  data, in megabytes, on the cluster, which may be more or
          less than TotalResizeDataInMegaBytes (the estimated total amount  of
          data before resize).

       ElapsedTimeInSeconds -> (long)
          The  amount  of seconds that have elapsed since the resize operation
          began. After the resize operation completes, this  value  shows  the
          total actual time, in seconds, for the resize operation.

       EstimatedTimeToCompletionInSeconds -> (long)
          The estimated time remaining, in seconds, until the resize operation
          is complete. This value is calculated based on  the  average  resize
          rate  and  the  estimated  amount of data remaining to be processed.
          Once the resize operation is complete, this value will be 0.

       ResizeType -> (string)
          An enum with possible values of ClassicResize  and  ElasticResize  .
          These values describe the type of resize operation being performed.

       Message -> (string)
          An  optional  string  to provide additional details about the resize
          action.

       TargetEncryptionType -> (string)
          The type of encryption for the cluster after the resize is complete.

          Possible values are KMS and None .

       DataTransferProgressPercent -> (double)
          The percent of data transferred from source cluster to target  clus-
          ter.
