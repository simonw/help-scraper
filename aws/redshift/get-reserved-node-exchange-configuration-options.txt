NAME
       get-reserved-node-exchange-configuration-options -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the  configuration  options for the reserved-node exchange. These
       options include information about the source reserved node  and  target
       reserved  node  offering. Details include the node type, the price, the
       node count, and the offering type.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-reserved-node-exchange-configuration-options is a paginated  opera-
       tion.  Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire
       data set of results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by  providing  the
       --no-paginate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argu-
       ment on a paginated response, the --query argument  must  extract  data
       from  the  results of the following query expressions: ReservedNodeCon-
       figurationOptionList

SYNOPSIS
            get-reserved-node-exchange-configuration-options
          --action-type <value>
          [--cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--snapshot-identifier <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --action-type (string)
          The action type of the reserved-node configuration. The action  type
          can be an exchange initiated from either a snapshot or a resize.

          Possible values:

          o restore-cluster

          o resize-cluster

       --cluster-identifier (string)
          The  identifier  for  the  cluster  that  is  the  source  for a re-
          served-node exchange.

       --snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier for the snapshot that  is  the  source  for  the  re-
          served-node exchange.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
