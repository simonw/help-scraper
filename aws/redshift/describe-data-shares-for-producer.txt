NAME
       describe-data-shares-for-producer -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of datashares when the account identifier being called
       is a producer account identifier.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-data-shares-for-producer is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: DataShares

SYNOPSIS
            describe-data-shares-for-producer
          [--producer-arn <value>]
          [--status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --producer-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the producer that returns in the
          list of datashares.

       --status (string)
          An identifier giving the status of a datashare in the  producer.  If
          this  field  is  specified,  Amazon  Redshift  returns  the  list of
          datashares that have the specified status.

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o AUTHORIZED

          o PENDING_AUTHORIZATION

          o DEAUTHORIZED

          o REJECTED

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DataShares -> (list)
          Shows the results of datashares available for producers.

          (structure)
              DataShareArn -> (string)
                 An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that references  the  datashare
                 that  is  owned by a specific namespace of the producer clus-
                 ter. A datashare ARN is in the arn:aws:redshift:{region}:{ac-
                 count-id}:{datashare}:{namespace-guid}/{datashare-name}  for-
                 mat.

              ProducerArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the producer.

              AllowPubliclyAccessibleConsumers -> (boolean)
                 A value that specifies whether the datashare can be shared to
                 a publicly accessible cluster.

              DataShareAssociations -> (list)
                 A  value that specifies when the datashare has an association
                 between a producer and data consumers.

                 (structure)
                     The association of a datashare from  a  producer  account
                     with a data consumer.

                     ConsumerIdentifier -> (string)
                        The name of the consumer accounts that have an associ-
                        ation with a producer datashare.

                     Status -> (string)
                        The status of the datashare that is associated.

                     ConsumerRegion -> (string)
                        The Amazon Web Services Region  of  the  consumer  ac-
                        counts  that  have  an  association  with  a  producer
                        datashare.

                     CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
                        The creation date of the datashare that is associated.

                     StatusChangeDate -> (timestamp)
                        The status change data of the datashare that is  asso-
                        ciated.

              ManagedBy -> (string)
                 The identifier of a datashare to show its managing entity.

       Marker -> (string)
          An  optional parameter that specifies the starting point to return a
          set of response records. When the results of a   DescribeDataShares-
          ForProducer  request exceed the value specified in MaxRecords , Ama-
          zon Web Services returns a value in the  Marker  field  of  the  re-
          sponse. You can retrieve the next set of response records by provid-
          ing the returned marker value in the Marker parameter  and  retrying
          the request.
