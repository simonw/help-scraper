AUTHORIZE-SNAPSHOT-ACCESS()                        AUTHORIZE-SNAPSHOT-ACCESS()



NAME
       authorize-snapshot-access -

DESCRIPTION
       Authorizes  the  specified  Amazon  Web Services account to restore the
       specified snapshot.

       For more information about working with snapshots, go  to  Amazon  Red-
       shift Snapshots in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            authorize-snapshot-access
          --snapshot-identifier <value>
          [--snapshot-cluster-identifier <value>]
          --account-with-restore-access <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the snapshot the account is authorized to restore.

       --snapshot-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  identifier  of  the cluster the snapshot was created from. This
          parameter is required if your IAM user has  a  policy  containing  a
          snapshot  resource  element that specifies anything other than * for
          the cluster name.

       --account-with-restore-access (string)
          The identifier of the Amazon Web Services account authorized to  re-
          store the specified snapshot.

          To  share  a snapshot with Amazon Web Services Support, specify ama-
          zon-redshift-support.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                as "creating".

              o DescribeClusterSnapshots returns status as "creating", "avail-
                able", "final snapshot", or "failed".

              o DeleteClusterSnapshot returns status as "deleted".

              An  option that specifies whether to create the cluster with en-
              hanced VPC routing enabled. To create a cluster  that  uses  en-
              hanced  VPC  routing, the cluster must be in a VPC. For more in-
              formation, see Enhanced VPC Routing in the Amazon Redshift Clus-
              ter Management Guide.

              If this option is true , enhanced VPC routing is enabled.

          ManualSnapshotRemainingDays -> (integer)
              The number of days until a manual snapshot will pass its  reten-
              tion period.
