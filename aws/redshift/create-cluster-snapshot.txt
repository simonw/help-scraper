CREATE-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()                            CREATE-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       create-cluster-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a manual snapshot of the specified cluster. The cluster must be
       in the available state.

       For more information about working with snapshots, go  to  Amazon  Red-
       shift Snapshots in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-cluster-snapshot
          --snapshot-identifier <value>
          --cluster-identifier <value>
          [--manual-snapshot-retention-period <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --snapshot-identifier (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the snapshot that you are requesting. This
          identifier must be unique for all snapshots within  the  Amazon  Web
          Services account.

          Constraints:

          o Cannot be null, empty, or blank

          o Must contain from 1 to 255 alphanumeric characters or hyphens

          o First character must be a letter

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

          Example: my-snapshot-id

       --cluster-identifier (string)
          The cluster identifier for which you want a snapshot.

       --manual-snapshot-retention-period (integer)
          The  number of days that a manual snapshot is retained. If the value
          is -1, the manual snapshot is retained indefinitely.

          The value must be either -1 or an integer between 1 and 3,653.

          The default value is -1.

       --tags (list)
          A list of tag instances.

          (structure)
              A tag consisting of a name/value pair for a resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key, or name, for the resource tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for the resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              hanced VPC routing, the cluster must be in a VPC. For  more  in-
              formation, see Enhanced VPC Routing in the Amazon Redshift Clus-

              tion period.
