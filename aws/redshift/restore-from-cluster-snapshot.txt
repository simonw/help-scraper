RESTORE-FROM-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()                RESTORE-FROM-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       restore-from-cluster-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new cluster from a snapshot. By default, Amazon Redshift cre-
       ates the resulting cluster with the same configuration as the  original
       cluster  from which the snapshot was created, except that the new clus-
       ter is created with the default cluster security and parameter  groups.
       After Amazon Redshift creates the cluster, you can use the  ModifyClus-
       ter API to associate a different security group and different parameter
       group  with  the restored cluster. If you are using a DS node type, you
       can also choose to change to another DS node type of the same size dur-
       ing restore.

       If  you restore a cluster into a VPC, you must provide a cluster subnet
       group where you want the cluster restored.

       For more information about working with snapshots, go  to  Amazon  Red-
       shift Snapshots in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide .

          The  name  of the cluster the source snapshot was created from. This
          parameter is required if your IAM user has  a  policy  containing  a
          snapshot  resource  element that specifies anything other than * for
          the cluster name.

       --cluster-subnet-group-name (string)
          The name of the subnet group where you want to cluster restored.

          A snapshot of cluster in VPC can be restored only in VPC. Therefore,
          you  must  provide  subnet group name where you want the cluster re-
          stored.

          The name of the parameter group to be associated with this cluster.

          Default:  The  default  Amazon Redshift cluster parameter group. For
          information about the default parameter group, go  to  Working  with
          Amazon Redshift Parameter Groups .

          Constraints:

          o Must be 1 to 255 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.

          VPC security groups only apply to clusters in VPCs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --preferred-maintenance-window (string)
          The  weekly time range (in UTC) during which automated cluster main-
          tenance can occur.

          Format: ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi

          Default: The value selected for the cluster from which the  snapshot
          was  taken.  For more information about the time blocks for each re-
          gion, see Maintenance Windows in Amazon Redshift Cluster  Management
          Guide.

          Valid Days: Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun

          Constraints: Minimum 30-minute window.

       --automated-snapshot-retention-period (integer)
          The  number  of  days  that automated snapshots are retained. If the
          value is 0, automated snapshots  are  disabled.  Even  if  automated
          snapshots  are  disabled, you can still create manual snapshots when
          you want with  CreateClusterSnapshot .

          You can't disable automated snapshots for RA3 node  types.  Set  the
          automated retention period from 1-35 days.

          Default:  The value selected for the cluster from which the snapshot
          was taken.

          Constraints: Must be a value from 0 to 35.

       --manual-snapshot-retention-period (integer)
          The default number of days to retain a manual snapshot. If the value
          is  -1,  the snapshot is retained indefinitely. This setting doesn't
          change the retention period of existing snapshots.

          The value must be either -1 or an integer between 1 and 3,653.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Key Management Service (KMS) key ID of the encryption  key  that
          encrypts  data  in  the cluster restored from a shared snapshot. You
          can also provide the key ID when you  restore  from  an  unencrypted
          snapshot  to an encrypted cluster in the same account. Additionally,
          you can specify a new KMS key ID when you restore from an  encrypted
          snapshot  in  the  same account in order to change it. In that case,
          the restored cluster is encrypted with the new KMS key ID.

       --node-type (string)
          The node type that the restored cluster will be provisioned with.

          Default: The node type of the cluster from which  the  snapshot  was
          taken.  You  can  modify  this if you are using any DS node type. In
          that case, you can choose to restore into another DS  node  type  of
          the  same  size.  For  example,  you  can  restore  ds1.8xlarge into
          ds2.8xlarge, or ds1.xlarge into ds2.xlarge. If you  have  a  DC  in-
          stance type, you must restore into that same instance type and size.
          In other words, you can only restore a dc1.large instance type  into
          another  dc1.large  instance  type  or  dc2.large instance type. You
          can't  restore  dc1.8xlarge  to  dc2.8xlarge.  First  restore  to  a
          dc1.8xlarge  cluster,  then resize to a dc2.8large cluster. For more
          information about node types, see About Clusters and  Nodes  in  the
          Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide .

       --enhanced-vpc-routing | --no-enhanced-vpc-routing (boolean)
          An option that specifies whether to create the cluster with enhanced
          VPC routing enabled. To create a  cluster  that  uses  enhanced  VPC
          routing,  the  cluster  must  be in a VPC. For more information, see
          Enhanced VPC Routing  in  the  Amazon  Redshift  Cluster  Management
          Guide.

          If this option is true , enhanced VPC routing is enabled.

          Default: false

       --additional-info (string)
          Reserved.

       --iam-roles (list)
          A  list  of  Identity  and Access Management (IAM) roles that can be
          used by the cluster to access other Amazon  Web  Services  services.
          You  must  supply  the IAM roles in their Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
          format.

          The maximum number of IAM roles that you can associate is subject to
          a quota. For more information, go to Quotas and limits in the Amazon
          Redshift Cluster Management Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --maintenance-track-name (string)
          The name of the maintenance track for the restored cluster. When you
          take  a  snapshot,  the snapshot inherits the MaintenanceTrack value
          from the cluster. The snapshot might be on a  different  track  than
          the  cluster that was the source for the snapshot. For example, sup-
          pose that you take a snapshot of a cluster that is  on  the  current
          track  and  then  change the cluster to be on the trailing track. In
          this case, the snapshot and the  source  cluster  are  on  different
          tracks.

       --snapshot-schedule-identifier (string)
          A unique identifier for the snapshot schedule.

       --number-of-nodes (integer)
          The  number  of nodes specified when provisioning the restored clus-
          ter.

       --availability-zone-relocation   |    --no-availability-zone-relocation
       (boolean)
          The  option  to enable relocation for an Amazon Redshift cluster be-
          tween Availability Zones after the cluster is restored.

       --aqua-configuration-status (string)
          The value represents how the cluster is configured to use AQUA  (Ad-
          vanced  Query  Accelerator)  after the cluster is restored. Possible
          values include the following.

          o enabled - Use AQUA if it is available for the current  Amazon  Web
            Services Region and Amazon Redshift node type.

          o disabled - Don't use AQUA.

          o auto - Amazon Redshift determines whether to use AQUA.

          Possible values:

          o enabled

          o disabled

          o auto

       --default-iam-role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the IAM role that was set as de-
          fault for the cluster when the cluster was last  modified  while  it
          was restored from a snapshot.

       --reserved-node-id (string)
          The identifier of the target reserved node offering.

       --target-reserved-node-offering-id (string)
          The identifier of the target reserved node offering.

       --encrypted | --no-encrypted (boolean)
          Enables  support  for restoring an unencrypted snapshot to a cluster
          encrypted with Key Management Service (KMS) and a  customer  managed
          key.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
