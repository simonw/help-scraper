NAME
       describe-reserved-node-exchange-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  exchange  status  details  and  associated  metadata for a re-
       served-node exchange. Statuses include such values as in  progress  and
       requested.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-reserved-node-exchange-status is a paginated operation. Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate ar-
       gument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on  a  pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: ReservedNodeExchangeStatusDetails

SYNOPSIS
            describe-reserved-node-exchange-status
          [--reserved-node-id <value>]
          [--reserved-node-exchange-request-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --reserved-node-id (string)
          The identifier of the source reserved node in  a  reserved-node  ex-
          change request.

       --reserved-node-exchange-request-id (string)
          The identifier of the reserved-node exchange request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          The details of the reserved-node  exchange  request,  including  the
          status,  request  time,  source  reserved-node identifier, and addi-
          tional details.

          (structure)
              Reserved-node status details, such as the  source  reserved-node

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the reserved-node  exchange  request.  Statuses
                 include in-progress and requested.

              RequestTime -> (timestamp)
                 A date and time that indicate when the reserved-node exchange
                 was requested.

              SourceReservedNodeId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the source reserved node.

              SourceReservedNodeType -> (string)
                 The source reserved-node type, for example ds2.xlarge.

              SourceReservedNodeCount -> (integer)

              TargetReservedNodeOfferingId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the target reserved node offering.

              TargetReservedNodeType -> (string)
                 The node type  of  the  target  reserved  node,  for  example
                 ra3.4xlarge.

              TargetReservedNodeCount -> (integer)
                 The count of target reserved nodes in the cluster.

       Marker -> (string)
          A  pagination  token  provided by a previous DescribeReservedNodeEx-
          changeStatus request.
