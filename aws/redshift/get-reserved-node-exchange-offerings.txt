GET-RESERVED-NODE-EXCHANGE-OFFERINGS()  GET-RESERVED-NODE-EXCHANGE-OFFERINGS()



NAME
       get-reserved-node-exchange-offerings -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  an array of DC2 ReservedNodeOfferings that matches the payment
       type, term, and usage price of the given DC1 reserved node.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-reserved-node-exchange-offerings is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: ReservedNodeOfferings

SYNOPSIS
            get-reserved-node-exchange-offerings
          --reserved-node-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --reserved-node-id (string)
          A  string representing the node identifier for the DC1 Reserved Node
          to be exchanged.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get reserved node exchange offerings

       The following get-reserved-node-exchange-offerings example retrieves an
       array  of  DC2  ReservedNodeOfferings  that match the specified DC1 re-
       served node.

          aws redshift get-reserved-node-exchange-offerings \
              --reserved-node-id 12345678-12ab-12a1-1a2a-12ab-12a12EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "ReservedNodeOfferings": [
                  {
                      "ReservedNodeOfferingId": "12345678-12ab-12a1-1a2a-12ab-12a12EXAMPLE",
                      "NodeType": "dc2.large",
                      "Duration": 31536000,
                      "FixedPrice": 0.0,
                      "UsagePrice": 0.0,
                      "CurrencyCode": "USD",
                      "OfferingType": "All Upfront",
                      "RecurringCharges": [
                          {
                              "RecurringChargeAmount": 0.0,
                              "RecurringChargeFrequency": "Hourly"
                          }
                      ],
                      "ReservedNodeOfferingType": "Regular"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          An  optional parameter that specifies the starting point for return-
          ing a set  of  response  records.  When  the  results  of  a  GetRe-
          servedNodeExchangeOfferings  request  exceed  the value specified in
          MaxRecords, Amazon Redshift returns a value in the marker  field  of
          the  response.  You can retrieve the next set of response records by
          providing the returned marker value  in  the  marker  parameter  and
          retrying the request.

       ReservedNodeOfferings -> (list)
          Returns an array of  ReservedNodeOffering objects.

                 the node.

              FixedPrice -> (double)
                 The upfront fixed charge you will pay to  purchase  the  spe-
                 cific reserved node offering.

              CurrencyCode -> (string)
                 The currency code for the compute nodes offering.

              OfferingType -> (string)
                 The anticipated utilization of the reserved node, as  defined
