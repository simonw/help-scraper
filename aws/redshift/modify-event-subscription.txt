       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-event-subscription
          --subscription-name <value>
          [--sns-topic-arn <value>]
          [--source-type <value>]
          [--source-ids <value>]
          [--event-categories <value>]
          [--severity <value>]
          [--enabled | --no-enabled]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subscription-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  modified Amazon Redshift event notification sub-
          scription.

       --sns-topic-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SNS topic to be  used  by  the
          event notification subscription.

       --source-type (string)
          The  type of source that will be generating the events. For example,
          if you want to be notified of events generated  by  a  cluster,  you
          would set this parameter to cluster. If this value is not specified,
          events are returned for all Amazon Redshift objects in  your  Amazon
          Web  Services  account.  You  must specify a source type in order to
          specify source IDs.

          Valid  values:   cluster,   cluster-parameter-group,   cluster-secu-
          rity-group, cluster-snapshot, and scheduled-action.

       --source-ids (list)
          A list of one or more identifiers of Amazon Redshift source objects.
          All of the objects must be of the same type as was specified in  the
          source  type  parameter.  The  event  subscription  will return only
          events generated by the specified objects. If  not  specified,  then
          events  are  returned  for all objects within the source type speci-
          fied.

          Example: my-cluster-1, my-cluster-2

          Example: my-snapshot-20131010

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --event-categories (list)
          Specifies the Amazon Redshift event categories to  be  published  by
          the event notification subscription.

          Values: configuration, management, monitoring, security, pending

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --severity (string)
          Specifies  the Amazon Redshift event severity to be published by the
          event notification subscription.

          Values: ERROR, INFO

       --enabled | --no-enabled (boolean)
          A Boolean value indicating if the subscription is enabled. true  in-
          dicates the subscription is enabled

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
