NAME
       describe-hsm-client-certificates -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about the specified HSM client certificate. If no
       certificate ID is specified, returns information about all the HSM cer-
       tificates owned by your Amazon Web Services account.

       If you specify both tag keys and tag values in the same request, Amazon
       Redshift returns all HSM client certificates that match any combination
       of  the  specified  keys and values. For example, if you have owner and
       environment for tag keys, and admin and test for tag  values,  all  HSM
       client  certificates  that have any combination of those values are re-
       turned.

       If both tag keys and values are omitted from the  request,  HSM  client
       certificates  are  returned regardless of whether they have tag keys or
       values associated with them.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-hsm-client-certificates is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: HsmClientCertificates

SYNOPSIS
            describe-hsm-client-certificates
          [--hsm-client-certificate-identifier <value>]
          [--tag-keys <value>]
          [--tag-values <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --hsm-client-certificate-identifier (string)
          The  identifier  of  a specific HSM client certificate for which you
          want information. If no identifier is specified, information is  re-
          turned for all HSM client certificates owned by your Amazon Web Ser-
          vices account.

       --tag-keys (list)
          A tag key or keys for which you want  to  return  all  matching  HSM
          client  certificates  that  are associated with the specified key or
          keys. For example, suppose that you  have  HSM  client  certificates
          that  are  tagged  with  keys  called owner and environment . If you
          specify both of these tag keys in the request, Amazon  Redshift  re-
          turns  a  response with the HSM client certificates that have either
          or both of these tag keys associated with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tag-values (list)
          A tag value or values for which you want to return all matching  HSM
          client certificates that are associated with the specified tag value
          or values. For example, suppose that you have  HSM  client  certifi-
          cates  that  are  tagged  with values called admin and test . If you
          specify both of these tag values in the request, Amazon Redshift re-
          turns  a  response with the HSM client certificates that have either
          or both of these tag values associated with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe HSM client certificates

       The following describe-hsm-client-certificates example displays details
       for the specified HSM client certificate.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          A  value  that  indicates the starting point for the next set of re-
          sponse records in a subsequent request. If a value is returned in  a
          response, you can retrieve the next set of records by providing this
          returned marker value in the Marker parameter and retrying the  com-
          mand.  If  the Marker field is empty, all response records have been
          retrieved for the request.

       HsmClientCertificates -> (list)
          A list of the identifiers for one or more  HSM  client  certificates
          used  by Amazon Redshift clusters to store and retrieve database en-
          cryption keys in an HSM.

          (structure)
              Returns information about an HSM client  certificate.  The  cer-
              tificate  is  stored  in a secure Hardware Storage Module (HSM),
              and used by the Amazon Redshift cluster to encrypt data files.

              HsmClientCertificateIdentifier -> (string)
                 The identifier of the HSM client certificate.

              HsmClientCertificatePublicKey -> (string)
                 The public key that the Amazon Redshift cluster will  use  to
                 connect  to  the HSM. You must register the public key in the
                 HSM.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The list of tags for the HSM client certificate.

                 (structure)
                     A tag consisting of a name/value pair for a resource.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key, or name, for the resource tag.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value for the resource tag.
