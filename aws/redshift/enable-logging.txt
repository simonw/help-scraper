NAME
       enable-logging -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  logging  information,  such as queries and connection attempts,
       for the specified Amazon Redshift cluster.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            enable-logging
          --cluster-identifier <value>
          --bucket-name <value>
          [--s3-key-prefix <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the cluster on which logging is to be started.

          Example: examplecluster

       --bucket-name (string)
          The name of an existing S3 bucket where the  log  files  are  to  be
          stored.

          Constraints:

          o Must be in the same region as the cluster

          o The cluster must have read bucket and put object permissions

       --s3-key-prefix (string)
          The prefix applied to the log file names.

          Constraints:

          o Cannot exceed 512 characters

          o Cannot  contain spaces( ), double quotes ("), single quotes ('), a
            backslash (), or control characters. The hexadecimal codes for in-
            valid characters are:

            o x00 to x20

            o x22

            o x27

            o x5c

            o x7f or larger

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LoggingEnabled -> (boolean)
          true if logging is on, false if logging is off.

       BucketName -> (string)
          The name of the S3 bucket where the log files are stored.

       S3KeyPrefix -> (string)
          The prefix applied to the log file names.

       LastSuccessfulDeliveryTime -> (timestamp)
          The last time that logs were delivered.

       LastFailureTime -> (timestamp)
          The last time when logs failed to be delivered.
