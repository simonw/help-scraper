NAME
       modify-usage-limit -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  a usage limit in a cluster. You can't modify the feature type
       or period of a usage limit.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-usage-limit
          --usage-limit-id <value>
          [--amount <value>]
          [--breach-action <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --usage-limit-id (string)
          The identifier of the usage limit to modify.

       --amount (long)
          The new limit amount. For more information about this parameter, see
          UsageLimit .

       --breach-action (string)
          The new action that Amazon Redshift takes when the limit is reached.
          For more information about this parameter, see  UsageLimit .

          Possible values:

          o log

          o emit-metric

          o disable

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
