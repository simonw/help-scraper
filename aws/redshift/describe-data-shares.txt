DESCRIBE-DATA-SHARES()                                  DESCRIBE-DATA-SHARES()



NAME
       describe-data-shares -

DESCRIPTION
       Shows the status of any inbound or outbound datashares available in the
       specified account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-data-shares is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: DataShares

SYNOPSIS
            describe-data-shares
          [--data-share-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --data-share-arn (string)
          The identifier of the datashare to describe details of.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DataShares -> (list)
          The results returned from describing datashares.

          (structure)
              DataShareArn -> (string)
                 An  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that references the datashare
                 that is owned by a specific namespace of the  producer  clus-
                 ter. A datashare ARN is in the arn:aws:redshift:{region}:{ac-
                 count-id}:{datashare}:{namespace-guid}/{datashare-name}  for-
                 mat.

              ProducerArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the producer.

              AllowPubliclyAccessibleConsumers -> (boolean)
                 A value that specifies whether the datashare can be shared to
                 a publicly accessible cluster.

              DataShareAssociations -> (list)
                 A value that specifies when the datashare has an  association
                 between a producer and data consumers.

                 (structure)
                     The  association  of  a datashare from a producer account
                     with a data consumer.

                     ConsumerIdentifier -> (string)
                        The name of the consumer accounts that have an associ-
                        ation with a producer datashare.

                     Status -> (string)
                        The status of the datashare that is associated.

                     ConsumerRegion -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Web  Services  Region of the consumer ac-
                        counts  that  have  an  association  with  a  producer
                        datashare.

                     CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
                        The creation date of the datashare that is associated.

                     StatusChangeDate -> (timestamp)
                        The  status change data of the datashare that is asso-
                        ciated.

              ManagedBy -> (string)
                 The identifier of a datashare to show its managing entity.

       Marker -> (string)
          An optional parameter that specifies the starting point to return  a
          set  of  response records. When the results of a  DescribeDataShares
          request exceed the value specified in MaxRecords , Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices  returns  a value in the Marker field of the response. You can
          retrieve the next set of response records by providing the  returned
          marker value in the Marker parameter and retrying the request.
