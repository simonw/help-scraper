SYNOPSIS
            describe-partners
          --account-id <value>
          --cluster-identifier <value>
          [--database-name <value>]
          [--partner-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID that owns the cluster.

       --cluster-identifier (string)
          The cluster identifier of the cluster whose partner  integration  is
          being described.

       --database-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  database  whose partner integration is being de-
          scribed. If database name is not specified, then  all  databases  in
          the cluster are described.

       --partner-name (string)
          The  name of the partner that is being described. If partner name is
          not specified, then all partner integrations are described.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
