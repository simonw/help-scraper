DESCRIBE-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOTS()                      DESCRIBE-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOTS()



NAME
       describe-cluster-snapshots -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns one or more snapshot objects, which contain metadata about your
       cluster snapshots. By default, this operation returns information about
       all  snapshots  of  all clusters that are owned by your Amazon Web Ser-
       vices account. No information is returned for snapshots owned by  inac-
       tive Amazon Web Services accounts.

       If you specify both tag keys and tag values in the same request, Amazon
       Redshift returns all snapshots that match any combination of the speci-
       fied  keys  and  values. For example, if you have owner and environment
       for tag keys, and admin and test for tag  values,  all  snapshots  that
       have  any combination of those values are returned. Only snapshots that
       you own are returned in the response; shared snapshots are not returned
       with the tag key and tag value request parameters.

       If both tag keys and values are omitted from the request, snapshots are
       returned regardless of whether they have tag keys or values  associated
       with them.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-cluster-snapshots is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: Snapshots

OPTIONS
       --cluster-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the cluster which generated  the  requested  snap-
          shots.

       --snapshot-identifier (string)
          The snapshot identifier of the snapshot about which to return infor-
          mation.

       --snapshot-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the snapshot associated  with  the
          message to describe cluster snapshots.

       --snapshot-type (string)
          The  type  of snapshots for which you are requesting information. By
          default, snapshots of all types are returned.

          Valid Values: automated | manual

       --start-time (timestamp)
          A value that requests only snapshots created at or after the  speci-
          fied  time. The time value is specified in ISO 8601 format. For more
          information about ISO 8601, go to the ISO8601 Wikipedia page.

          Example: 2012-07-16T18:00:00Z

       --end-time (timestamp)
          A time value that requests only snapshots created at or  before  the
          specified  time. The time value is specified in ISO 8601 format. For
          more information about ISO 8601, go to the ISO8601 Wikipedia page.

          Example: 2012-07-16T18:00:00Z

       --owner-account (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account used to create or copy the snapshot.
          Use this field to filter the results to snapshots owned by a partic-
          ular account. To describe snapshots you  own,  either  specify  your
          Amazon Web Services account, or do not specify the parameter.

       --tag-keys (list)
          A  tag key or keys for which you want to return all matching cluster
          snapshots that are associated with the specified key  or  keys.  For
          example,  suppose  that you have snapshots that are tagged with keys
          called owner and environment . If you specify both of these tag keys
          in  the  request,  Amazon Redshift returns a response with the snap-
          shots that have either or both of these  tag  keys  associated  with
          them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tag-values (list)
          A  tag  value  or  values  for which you want to return all matching
          cluster snapshots that are associated with the specified  tag  value
          or  values.  For  example,  suppose that you have snapshots that are
          tagged with values called admin and test . If you  specify  both  of
          these  tag values in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response
          with the snapshots that have either or both of these tag values  as-
          sociated with them.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cluster-exists | --no-cluster-exists (boolean)
          A  value  that indicates whether to return snapshots only for an ex-
          isting cluster. You can perform table-level restore only by using  a
          snapshot  of  an  existing  cluster, that is, a cluster that has not
          been deleted. Values for this parameter work as follows:

          o If ClusterExists is set to true , ClusterIdentifier is required.

          o If ClusterExists is set to false and ClusterIdentifier isn't spec-
            ified,  all  snapshots  associated with deleted clusters (orphaned
            snapshots) are returned.

          o If ClusterExists is set to false and ClusterIdentifier  is  speci-
            fied for a deleted cluster, snapshots associated with that cluster
            are returned.

          o If ClusterExists is set to false and ClusterIdentifier  is  speci-
            fied for an existing cluster, no snapshots are returned.

       --sorting-entities (list)
          (structure)
              Describes a sorting entity

              Attribute -> (string)
                 The category for sorting the snapshots.

              SortOrder -> (string)
                 The order for listing the attributes.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Attribute=string,SortOrder=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Attribute": "SOURCE_TYPE"|"TOTAL_SIZE"|"CREATE_TIME",
              "SortOrder": "ASC"|"DESC"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          A value that indicates the starting point for the next  set  of  re-
          sponse  records in a subsequent request. If a value is returned in a
          response, you can retrieve the next set of records by providing this
          returned  marker value in the Marker parameter and retrying the com-
          mand. If the Marker field is empty, all response records  have  been
          retrieved for the request.

       Snapshots -> (list)
          A list of  Snapshot instances.

          (structure)

              Status -> (string)
                 The snapshot status. The value of the status depends  on  the
                 API operation used:

                 o CreateClusterSnapshot and  CopyClusterSnapshot returns sta-
                   tus as "creating".

                 o DescribeClusterSnapshots  returns  status  as   "creating",
                   "available", "final snapshot", or "failed".

                 o DeleteClusterSnapshot returns status as "deleted".

                 The cluster version of the cluster used to create  the  snap-
                 shot. For example, 1.0.15503.

              SnapshotType -> (string)
                 The  snapshot  type.  Snapshots created using  CreateCluster-

                 The  VPC  identifier of the cluster if the snapshot is from a
                 cluster in a VPC. Otherwise, this field is not in the output.

              Encrypted -> (boolean)
                 If true , the data in the snapshot is encrypted at rest.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The Key Management Service (KMS) key ID of the encryption key
                 that  was  used to encrypt data in the cluster from which the
                 snapshot was taken.

              EncryptedWithHSM -> (boolean)
                 A boolean that indicates whether the  snapshot  data  is  en-
                 crypted  using the HSM keys of the source cluster. true indi-
                 cates that the data is encrypted using HSM keys.

                        count authorized to restore a snapshot. For Amazon Web
                        Services  Support,  the  identifier   is   amazon-red-
                        shift-support .

              OwnerAccount -> (string)
                 For manual snapshots, the Amazon Web Services account used to
                 create or copy the snapshot.  For  automatic  snapshots,  the

                 (string)

              EnhancedVpcRouting -> (boolean)
                 An  option  that specifies whether to create the cluster with
                 enhanced VPC routing enabled. To create a cluster  that  uses
                 enhanced  VPC routing, the cluster must be in a VPC. For more
                 information, see Enhanced VPC Routing in the Amazon  Redshift
                 Cluster Management Guide.

                 If this option is true , enhanced VPC routing is enabled.

              ManualSnapshotRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
                 The number of days that a manual snapshot is retained. If the
                 value is -1, the manual snapshot is retained indefinitely.

                 3,653.

              ManualSnapshotRemainingDays -> (integer)
                 The  number of days until a manual snapshot will pass its re-
                 tention period.

              SnapshotRetentionStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp representing the start of  the  retention  period
                 for the snapshot.
