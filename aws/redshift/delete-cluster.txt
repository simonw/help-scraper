DELETE-CLUSTER()                                              DELETE-CLUSTER()



NAME
       delete-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a previously provisioned cluster without its final snapshot be-
       ing created. A successful response from the web service indicates  that
       the  request  was  received correctly. Use  DescribeClusters to monitor
       the status of the deletion. The delete operation cannot be canceled  or
       reverted  once submitted. For more information about managing clusters,
       go to Amazon Redshift Clusters in the Amazon Redshift  Cluster  Manage-
       ment Guide .

       If  you want to shut down the cluster and retain it for future use, set
       SkipFinalClusterSnapshot to false and specify a name for  FinalCluster-
       SnapshotIdentifier  . You can later restore this snapshot to resume us-
       ing the cluster. If a final cluster snapshot is requested,  the  status
       of  the  cluster  will  be "final-snapshot" while the snapshot is being
       taken, then it's "deleting" once Amazon Redshift  begins  deleting  the
       cluster.

       For  more  information  about  managing clusters, go to Amazon Redshift
       Clusters in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide .

OPTIONS
       --cluster-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the cluster to be deleted.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain lowercase characters.

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.

          o First character must be a letter.

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

       --skip-final-cluster-snapshot | --no-skip-final-cluster-snapshot (bool-
       ean)
          Determines whether a final snapshot of the cluster is created before
          Amazon Redshift deletes the cluster. If true , a final cluster snap-
          shot  is not created. If false , a final cluster snapshot is created
          before the cluster is deleted.

          NOTE:
              The FinalClusterSnapshotIdentifier parameter must  be  specified
              if SkipFinalClusterSnapshot is false .

          Default: false

       --final-cluster-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The  identifier  of the final snapshot that is to be created immedi-
          ately before deleting the cluster. If this  parameter  is  provided,
          SkipFinalClusterSnapshot must be false .

          Constraints:

          o Must be 1 to 255 alphanumeric characters.

          o First character must be a letter.

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

       --final-cluster-snapshot-retention-period (integer)
          The  number of days that a manual snapshot is retained. If the value
          is -1, the manual snapshot is retained indefinitely.

          The value must be either -1 or an integer between 1 and 3,653.

          The default value is -1.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
