MODIFY-CLUSTER()                                              MODIFY-CLUSTER()



NAME
       modify-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies the settings for a cluster.

       You  can  also  change node type and the number of nodes to scale up or
       down the cluster. When resizing a cluster, you must  specify  both  the
       number  of  nodes  and the node type even if one of the parameters does
       not change.

       You can add another security or parameter group, or  change  the  admin
       user  password.  Resetting a cluster password or modifying the security
       groups associated with a cluster do not need a reboot. However, modify-
       ing  a parameter group requires a reboot for parameters to take effect.
       For more information about managing clusters,  go  to  Amazon  Redshift
       Clusters in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide .

OPTIONS
       --cluster-identifier (string)
          The unique identifier of the cluster to be modified.

          Example: examplecluster

       --cluster-type (string)
          The new cluster type.

          When  you  submit your cluster resize request, your existing cluster
          goes into a read-only mode. After Amazon Redshift provisions  a  new
          cluster  based on your resize requirements, there will be outage for
          a period while the old cluster is deleted  and  your  connection  is
          switched  to  the  new cluster. You can use  DescribeResize to track
          the progress of the resize request.

          Valid Values: multi-node | single-node

       --node-type (string)
          The new node type of the cluster. If you specify a  new  node  type,
          you must also specify the number of nodes parameter.

          For  more  information about resizing clusters, go to Resizing Clus-
          ters in Amazon Redshift in the Amazon  Redshift  Cluster  Management
          Guide .

          Valid  Values:  ds2.xlarge | ds2.8xlarge | dc1.large | dc1.8xlarge |
          dc2.large | dc2.8xlarge | ra3.xlplus | ra3.4xlarge | ra3.16xlarge

       --number-of-nodes (integer)
          The new number of nodes of the cluster. If you specify a new  number
          of nodes, you must also specify the node type parameter.

          For  more  information about resizing clusters, go to Resizing Clus-
          ters in Amazon Redshift in the Amazon  Redshift  Cluster  Management
          Guide .

          Valid Values: Integer greater than 0 .

       --cluster-security-groups (list)
          A  list of cluster security groups to be authorized on this cluster.
          This change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.

          Security groups currently associated with the cluster,  and  not  in
          the list of groups to apply, will be revoked from the cluster.

          Constraints:

          o Must be 1 to 255 alphanumeric characters or hyphens

          o First character must be a letter

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --vpc-security-group-ids (list)
          A  list of virtual private cloud (VPC) security groups to be associ-
          ated with the cluster. This change is asynchronously applied as soon
          as possible.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --master-user-password (string)
          The  new  password  for the cluster admin user. This change is asyn-
          chronously applied as soon as possible. Between the time of the  re-
          quest and the completion of the request, the MasterUserPassword ele-
          ment exists in the PendingModifiedValues element  of  the  operation
          response.

          NOTE:
              Operations never return the password, so this operation provides
              a way to regain access to the admin user account for  a  cluster
              if the password is lost.

          Default: Uses existing setting.

          Constraints:

          o Must be between 8 and 64 characters in length.

          o Must contain at least one uppercase letter.

          o Must contain at least one lowercase letter.

          o Must contain one number.

          o Can  be any printable ASCII character (ASCII code 33-126) except '
            (single quote), " (double quote), \ , / , or @ .

       --cluster-parameter-group-name (string)
          The name of the cluster parameter group to apply  to  this  cluster.
          This change is applied only after the cluster is rebooted. To reboot
          a cluster use  RebootCluster .

          Default: Uses existing setting.

          Constraints: The cluster parameter group must be in the same parame-
          ter group family that matches the cluster version.

       --automated-snapshot-retention-period (integer)
          The  number  of  days  that automated snapshots are retained. If the
          value is 0, automated snapshots  are  disabled.  Even  if  automated
          snapshots  are  disabled, you can still create manual snapshots when
          you want with  CreateClusterSnapshot .

          If you decrease the automated snapshot  retention  period  from  its
          current value, existing automated snapshots that fall outside of the
          new retention period will be immediately deleted.

          You can't disable automated snapshots for RA3 node  types.  Set  the
          automated retention period from 1-35 days.

          Default: Uses existing setting.

          Constraints: Must be a value from 0 to 35.

       --manual-snapshot-retention-period (integer)
          The  default for number of days that a newly created manual snapshot
          is retained. If the value is -1, the manual snapshot is retained in-
          definitely.  This  value  doesn't retroactively change the retention
          periods of existing manual snapshots.

          The value must be either -1 or an integer between 1 and 3,653.

          The default value is -1.

       --preferred-maintenance-window (string)
          The weekly time range (in UTC) during which system  maintenance  can
          occur,  if  necessary. If system maintenance is necessary during the
          window, it may result in an outage.

          This maintenance window change is made immediately. If the new main-
          tenance  window  indicates  the current time, there must be at least
          120 minutes between the current time and end of the window in  order
          to ensure that pending changes are applied.

          Default: Uses existing setting.

          Format: ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi, for example wed:07:30-wed:08:00 .

          Valid Days: Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun

          Constraints: Must be at least 30 minutes.

       --cluster-version (string)
          The new version number of the Amazon Redshift engine to upgrade to.

          For major version upgrades, if a non-default cluster parameter group
          is currently in use, a new cluster parameter group  in  the  cluster
          parameter  group  family  for the new version must be specified. The
          new cluster parameter group can be the default for that cluster  pa-
          rameter  group family. For more information about parameters and pa-
          rameter groups, go to Amazon Redshift Parameter Groups in the Amazon
          Redshift Cluster Management Guide .

          Example: 1.0

       --allow-version-upgrade | --no-allow-version-upgrade (boolean)
          If  true  ,  major version upgrades will be applied automatically to
          the cluster during the maintenance window.

          Default: false

       --hsm-client-certificate-identifier (string)
          Specifies the name of the HSM client certificate the Amazon Redshift
          cluster uses to retrieve the data encryption keys stored in an HSM.

       --hsm-configuration-identifier (string)
          Specifies the name of the HSM configuration that contains the infor-
          mation the Amazon Redshift cluster can use  to  retrieve  and  store
          keys in an HSM.

       --new-cluster-identifier (string)
          The new identifier for the cluster.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.

          o Alphabetic characters must be lowercase.

          o First character must be a letter.

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          o Must  be unique for all clusters within an Amazon Web Services ac-
            count.

          Example: examplecluster

       --publicly-accessible | --no-publicly-accessible (boolean)
          If true , the cluster can be accessed from a  public  network.  Only
          clusters in VPCs can be set to be publicly available.

       --elastic-ip (string)
          The Elastic IP (EIP) address for the cluster.

          Constraints:  The  cluster  must  be provisioned in EC2-VPC and pub-
          licly-accessible through an Internet gateway. For  more  information
          about provisioning clusters in EC2-VPC, go to Supported Platforms to
          Launch Your Cluster in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide.

       --enhanced-vpc-routing | --no-enhanced-vpc-routing (boolean)
          An option that specifies whether to create the cluster with enhanced
          VPC  routing  enabled.  To  create  a cluster that uses enhanced VPC
          routing, the cluster must be in a VPC.  For  more  information,  see
          Enhanced  VPC  Routing  in  the  Amazon  Redshift Cluster Management
          Guide.

          If this option is true , enhanced VPC routing is enabled.

          Default: false

       --maintenance-track-name (string)
          The name for the maintenance track that you want to assign  for  the
          cluster.  This name change is asynchronous. The new track name stays
          in the PendingModifiedValues for the cluster until the next  mainte-
          nance  window.  When  the  maintenance track changes, the cluster is
          switched to the latest cluster release available for the maintenance
          track. At this point, the maintenance track name is applied.

       --encrypted | --no-encrypted (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  the  cluster  is  encrypted. If the value is en-
          crypted (true) and you provide a value for the  KmsKeyId  parameter,
          we  encrypt  the  cluster  with the provided KmsKeyId . If you don't
          provide a KmsKeyId , we encrypt with the default key.

          If the value is not encrypted  (false),  then  the  cluster  is  de-
          crypted.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The  Key  Management Service (KMS) key ID of the encryption key that
          you want to use to encrypt data in the cluster.

       --availability-zone-relocation   |    --no-availability-zone-relocation
       (boolean)
          The  option  to enable relocation for an Amazon Redshift cluster be-
          tween Availability Zones after the cluster modification is complete.

       --availability-zone (string)
          The option to initiate relocation for an Amazon Redshift cluster  to
          the target Availability Zone.

       --port (integer)
          The option to change the port of an Amazon Redshift cluster.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
