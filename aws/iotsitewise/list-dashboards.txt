LIST-DASHBOARDS()                                            LIST-DASHBOARDS()



NAME
       list-dashboards -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  paginated  list of dashboards for an IoT SiteWise Monitor
       project.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-dashboards is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: dashboardSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-dashboards
          --project-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project-id (string)
          The ID of the project.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list all dashboards in a project

       The following list-dashboards example lists all dashboards that are de-
       fined in a project.

          aws iotsitewise list-dashboards \
              --project-id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-eeeeeEXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "dashboardSummaries": [
                  {
                      "id": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-fffffEXAMPLE",
                      "name": "Wind Farm",
                      "creationDate": "2020-05-01T20:32:12.228476348Z",
                      "lastUpdateDate": "2020-05-01T20:32:12.228476348Z"
                  }
              ]
          }
