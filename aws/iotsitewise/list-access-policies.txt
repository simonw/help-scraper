LIST-ACCESS-POLICIES()                                  LIST-ACCESS-POLICIES()



NAME
       list-access-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a paginated list of access policies for an identity (an Ama-
       zon Web Services SSO user, an Amazon Web Services SSO group, or an  IAM
       user) or an IoT SiteWise Monitor resource (a portal or project).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-access-policies  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: accessPolicySummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-access-policies
          [--identity-type <value>]
          [--identity-id <value>]
          [--resource-type <value>]
          [--resource-id <value>]
          [--iam-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --identity-type (string)
          The type of identity (Amazon Web Services SSO user, Amazon Web  Ser-
          vices  SSO  group,  or  IAM user). This parameter is required if you
          specify identityId .

          Possible values:

          o USER

          o GROUP

          o IAM

       --identity-id (string)
          The ID of the identity. This parameter is required  if  you  specify
          USER or GROUP for identityType .

       --resource-type (string)
          The type of resource (portal or project). This parameter is required
          if you specify resourceId .

          Possible values:

          o PORTAL

          o PROJECT

       --resource-id (string)
          The ID of the resource. This parameter is required  if  you  specify
          resourceType .

       --iam-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of the IAM user. For more information, see IAM ARNs in the
          IAM User Guide . This parameter is required if you specify  IAM  for
          identityType .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list all access policies

       The  following  list-access-policies  example lists all access policies
       for a user who is a portal administrator.

          aws iotsitewise list-access-policies \
              --identity-type USER \
              --identity-id a1b2c3d4e5-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-bbbbbEXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "accessPolicySummaries": [
                  {
                      "id": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-cccccEXAMPLE",
                      "identity": {
                          "user": {

                          }
                      },
                      "resource": {
                          "portal": {
                              "id": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-aaaaaEXAMPLE"
                          }
                      },
                      "permission": "ADMINISTRATOR"
                  }
              ]
          }
