CREATE-PORTAL()                                                CREATE-PORTAL()



NAME
       create-portal -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a portal, which can contain projects and dashboards. IoT Site-
       Wise Monitor uses Amazon Web Services SSO or IAM to authenticate portal
       users and manage user permissions.

       NOTE:
          Before  you  can  sign in to a new portal, you must add at least one
          identity to that portal. For more information, see Adding or  remov-
          ing portal administrators in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          A logo image to display in the portal. Upload a square, high-resolu-
          tion image. The image is displayed on a dark background.

          data -> (blob)
              The image file contents, represented as a base64-encoded string.
              The file size must be less than 1 MB.

              The file type of the image.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          data=blob,type=string

       JSON Syntax:

            "data": blob,
            "type": "PNG"
          }

       --role-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of a service role that allows the portal's users to access
          your IoT SiteWise resources on your behalf.  For  more  information,

          User Guide .

       --portal-auth-mode (string)
          The service to use to authenticate users to the portal. Choose  from
          the following options:

          o SSO  The portal uses Amazon Web Services Single Sign On to authen-
            ticate users and manage user permissions. Before you can create  a
            portal  that  uses Amazon Web Services SSO, you must enable Amazon
            Web Services SSO. For more information, see  Enabling  Amazon  Web
            Services  SSO in the IoT SiteWise User Guide . This option is only
            available in Amazon Web Services Regions other than the China  Re-
            gions.

          o IAM   The  portal uses Identity and Access Management to authenti-
            cate users and manage user permissions.

          You can't change this value after you create a portal.

          Default: SSO

          Possible values:

          o IAM

          o SSO

       --notification-sender-email (string)
          The email address that sends alarm notifications.

          WARNING:
              If you use the IoT Events managed Lambda function to manage your
              emails, you must verify the sender email address in Amazon SES .

       --alarms (structure)
          Contains the configuration information of an alarm created in an IoT
          SiteWise Monitor portal. You can use the alarm to monitor  an  asset
          property and get notified when the asset property value is outside a
          specified range. For more information, see Monitoring with alarms in
          the IoT SiteWise Application Guide .

          alarmRoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the IAM role that allows the alarm to perform actions
              and access Amazon Web Services resources and services,  such  as
              IoT Events.

          notificationLambdaArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the Lambda function that manages alarm notifications.
              For more information, see Managing alarm  notifications  in  the
              IoT Events Developer Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          alarmRoleArn=string,notificationLambdaArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "alarmRoleArn": "string",
            "notificationLambdaArn": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a portal

       The  following  create-portal  example  creates a web portal for a wind
       farm company. You can create portals only in the same Region where  you
       enabled AWS Single Sign-On.

          aws iotsitewise create-portal \
              --portal-name WindFarmPortal \
              --portal-description "A portal that contains wind farm projects for Example Corp." \
              --portal-contact-email support@example.com \
              --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/service-role/MySiteWiseMonitorServiceRole

       Output:

          {
              "portalId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-aaaaaEXAMPLE",
              "portalArn": "arn:aws:iotsitewise:us-west-2:123456789012:portal/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-aaaaaEXAMPLE",
              "portalStartUrl": "https://a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-aaaaaEXAMPLE.app.iotsitewise.aws",
              "portalStatus": {
                  "state": "CREATING"
              },
              "ssoApplicationId": "ins-a1b2c3d4-EXAMPLE"
          }
