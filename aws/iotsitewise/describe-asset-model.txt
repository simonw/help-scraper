DESCRIBE-ASSET-MODEL()                                  DESCRIBE-ASSET-MODEL()



NAME
       describe-asset-model -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about an asset model.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-asset-model
          --asset-model-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --asset-model-id (string)
          The ID of the asset model.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                 The  unit of the asset model property, such as Newtons or RPM
                 .

              type -> (structure)
                 The property type (see PropertyType ).

                 attribute -> (structure)
                     Specifies an asset attribute property. An attribute  gen-
                     erally  contains  static  information, such as the serial
                     number of an IIoT wind turbine.

                 transform -> (structure)
                     Specifies  an  asset transform property. A transform con-
                     tains a mathematical expression that  maps  a  property's
                     data points from one form to another, such as a unit con-
                     version from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

                                   The ID of the property to use as the  vari-
                                   able. You can use the property name if it's
                                   from the same asset model.

                               hierarchyId -> (string)
                                   The ID of the hierarchy to  query  for  the
                                   property  ID.  You  can use the hierarchy's
                                   name instead of the hierarchy's ID.

                                   You use a hierarchy ID instead of  a  model
                                   ID because you can have several hierarchies
                                   using the same model and therefore the same
                                   propertyId  .  For  example, you might have
                                   separately grouped assets  that  come  from
                                   the same asset model. For more information,

                     Specifies an asset metric property. A metric  contains  a
                     mathematical  expression that uses aggregate functions to
                     process all input data points over a  time  interval  and
                     output  a single data point, such as to calculate the av-
                     erage hourly temperature.

                     expression -> (string)
                        The mathematical expression that  defines  the  metric
                        aggregation  function.  You can specify up to 10 vari-
                        ables per expression. You can specify up to  10  func-
                        tions per expression.

                                   name instead of the hierarchy's ID.

                                   You use a hierarchy ID instead of  a  model
                                   ID because you can have several hierarchies
                                   using the same model and therefore the same
                                   propertyId  .  For  example, you might have
                                   separately grouped assets  that  come  from
                                   the same asset model. For more information,

                               (UTC), the 1h interval at the end of each hour,
                               and so on.

                               When  IoT  SiteWise  aggregates data points for
                               metric computations, the start of each interval
                               is  exclusive  and  the end of each interval is
                               inclusive. IoT  SiteWise  places  the  computed
                               data point at the end of the interval.

                            offset -> (string)
                               The  offset for the tumbling window. The offset
                               parameter accepts the following:

                               o The offset time. For example, if you  specify
                                 18h  for  offset  and  1d  for interval , IoT
                                 SiteWise aggregates data in one of  the  fol-
                                 lowing ways:

                                 o If  you create the metric before or at 6 PM
                                   (UTC), you get the first aggregation result
                                   at  6  PM  (UTC) on the day when you create
                                   the metric.

                                 o If you create the metric after 6 PM  (UTC),
                                   you  get  the first aggregation result at 6
                                   PM (UTC) the next day.

                               o The ISO 8601  format.  For  example,  if  you
                                 specify  PT18H for offset and 1d for interval
                                 , IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of  the
                                 following ways:

                                 o If  you create the metric before or at 6 PM
                                   (UTC), you get the first aggregation result
                                   at  6  PM  (UTC) on the day when you create
                                   the metric.

                                 o If you create the metric after 6 PM  (UTC),
                                   you  get  the first aggregation result at 6
                                   PM (UTC) the next day.

                               o The 24-hour clock. For example, if you  spec-
                                 ify  00:03:00  for offset , 5m for interval ,
                                 and you create the metric at 2 PM (UTC),  you
                                 get  the  first aggregation result at 2:03 PM
                                 (UTC). You get the second aggregation  result
                                 at 2:08 PM (UTC).

                               o The  offset  time  zone.  For example, if you
                                 specify 2021-07-23T18:00-08 for offset and 1d
                                 for  interval  , IoT SiteWise aggregates data
                                 in one of the following ways:

                                 o If you create the metric before or at 6  PM
                                   (PST), you get the first aggregation result
                                   at 6 PM (PST) on the day  when  you  create
                                   the metric.

                                 o If  you create the metric after 6 PM (PST),
                                   you get the first aggregation result  at  6
                                   PM (PST) the next day.

              childAssetModelId -> (string)
                 The  ID of the asset model. All assets in this hierarchy must
                 be instances of the childAssetModelId asset model.

       assetModelCompositeModels -> (list)
          The list of composite asset models for the asset model.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a composite model in an asset  model.

                        attribute -> (structure)
                            Specifies an asset attribute property.  An  attri-
                            bute  generally  contains static information, such
                            as the serial number of an IIoT wind turbine.

                            defaultValue -> (string)
                               The default value of the asset  model  property
                               attribute.  All assets that you create from the
                               asset model contain this attribute  value.  You
                               can  update an attribute's value after you cre-
                               ate  an  asset.  For  more   information,   see
                               Updating  attribute  values in the IoT SiteWise
                               User Guide .

                        measurement -> (structure)
                            Specifies an asset measurement  property.  A  mea-
                            surement  represents  a  device's  raw sensor data
                            stream, such as timestamped temperature values  or
                            timestamped power values.

                            processingConfig -> (structure)
                               The processing configuration for the given mea-
                               surement property. You can  configure  measure-
                               ments  to  be  kept at the edge or forwarded to
                               the Amazon Web Services Cloud. By default, mea-
                               surements are forwarded to the cloud.

                               forwardingConfig -> (structure)
                                   The  forwarding configuration for the given

                        transform -> (structure)
                            Specifies an asset transform property. A transform
                            contains a mathematical  expression  that  maps  a
                            property's  data  points from one form to another,
                            such as a unit conversion from Celsius to  Fahren-
                            heit.

                            expression -> (string)
                               The  mathematical  expression  that defines the
                               transformation function. You can specify up  to
                               10 variables per expression. You can specify up
                               to 10 functions per expression.

                            variables -> (list)
                               The list of variables used in the expression.

                               (structure)
                                   Contains expression variable information.

                                   name -> (string)
                                      The  friendly name of the variable to be
                                      used in the expression.

                                   value -> (structure)
                                      The variable that  identifies  an  asset
                                      property from which to use values.

                                      propertyId -> (string)
                                          The ID of the property to use as the
                                          variable. You can use  the  property
                                          name  if  it's  from  the same asset
                                          model.

                                      hierarchyId -> (string)
                                          The ID of the hierarchy to query for
                                          the property ID. You can use the hi-
                                          erarchy's name instead of the  hier-
                                          archy's ID.

                                          You  use a hierarchy ID instead of a
                                          model ID because you can  have  sev-
                                          eral   hierarchies  using  the  same
                                          model and therefore the same proper-
                                          tyId  .  For example, you might have
                                          separately grouped assets that  come
                                          from  the same asset model. For more
                                          information, see  Asset  hierarchies
                                          in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

                            processingConfig -> (structure)
                               The  processing  configuration  for  the  given
                               transform property. You  can  configure  trans-
                               forms  to  be  kept at the edge or forwarded to
                               the Amazon Web Services  Cloud.  You  can  also
                               configure transforms to be computed at the edge
                               or in the cloud.

                               computeLocation -> (string)
                                   The compute location for the  given  trans-
                                   form property.

                                      erty.

                        metric -> (structure)
                            Specifies  an asset metric property. A metric con-
                            tains a mathematical expression that  uses  aggre-
                            gate  functions  to  process all input data points
                            over a time interval  and  output  a  single  data
                            point,  such  as  to  calculate the average hourly
                            temperature.

                            expression -> (string)

                            variables -> (list)
                               The list of variables used in the expression.

                               (structure)
                                   Contains expression variable information.

                                   name -> (string)
                                      The friendly name of the variable to  be
                                      used in the expression.

                                   value -> (structure)
                                      The  variable  that  identifies an asset
                                      property from which to use values.

                                      propertyId -> (string)
                                          The ID of the property to use as the
                                          variable.  You  can use the property
                                          name if it's  from  the  same  asset
                                          model.

                                      hierarchyId -> (string)
                                          The ID of the hierarchy to query for
                                          the property ID. You can use the hi-
                                          erarchy's  name instead of the hier-
                                          archy's ID.

                                          You use a hierarchy ID instead of  a
                                          model  ID  because you can have sev-
                                          eral  hierarchies  using  the   same
                                          model and therefore the same proper-
                                          tyId . For example, you  might  have
                                          separately  grouped assets that come
                                          from the same asset model. For  more
                                          information,  see  Asset hierarchies
                                          in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

                            window -> (structure)
                               The window (time interval) over which IoT Site-
                               Wise  computes the metric's aggregation expres-
                               sion. IoT SiteWise computes one data point  per
                               window .

                               tumbling -> (structure)
                                   The tumbling time interval window.

                                   interval -> (string)
                                      The  time interval for the tumbling win-
                                      dow. The interval time must be between 1
                                      minute and 1 week.

                                      IoT  SiteWise  computes  the 1w interval
                                      the end of Sunday at midnight each  week
                                      (UTC),  the  1d  interval  at the end of
                                      each day at midnight (UTC), the  1h  in-
                                      terval  at  the end of each hour, and so
                                      on.

                                      When IoT SiteWise aggregates data points
                                      for  metric  computations,  the start of
                                      each interval is exclusive and  the  end
                                      of each interval is inclusive. IoT Site-
                                      Wise places the computed data  point  at
                                      the end of the interval.

                                   offset -> (string)
                                      The  offset for the tumbling window. The
                                      offset parameter accepts the following:

                                      o The offset time. For example,  if  you
                                        specify  18h for offset and 1d for in-
                                        terval , IoT SiteWise aggregates  data
                                        in one of the following ways:

                                        o If  you  create the metric before or
                                          at 6 PM (UTC), you get the first ag-
                                          gregation  result  at  6 PM (UTC) on
                                          the day when you create the metric.

                                        o If you create the metric after 6  PM
                                          (UTC), you get the first aggregation
                                          result at 6 PM (UTC) the next day.

                                      o The ISO 8601 format. For  example,  if
                                        you  specify  PT18H  for offset and 1d
                                        for interval , IoT SiteWise aggregates
                                        data in one of the following ways:

                                        o If  you  create the metric before or
                                          at 6 PM (UTC), you get the first ag-
                                          gregation  result  at  6 PM (UTC) on
                                          the day when you create the metric.

                                        o If you create the metric after 6  PM
                                          (UTC), you get the first aggregation
                                          result at 6 PM (UTC) the next day.

                                      o The 24-hour clock. For example, if you
                                        specify  00:03:00  for offset , 5m for
                                        interval , and you create  the  metric
                                        at  2  PM (UTC), you get the first ag-
                                        gregation result at 2:03 PM (UTC). You
                                        get  the  second aggregation result at
                                        2:08 PM (UTC).

                                      o The offset time zone. For example,  if
                                        you  specify  2021-07-23T18:00-08  for
                                        offset and 1d for interval , IoT Site-
                                        Wise  aggregates  data  in  one of the
                                        following ways:

                                        o If you create the metric  before  or
                                          at 6 PM (PST), you get the first ag-
                                          gregation result at 6  PM  (PST)  on
                                          the day when you create the metric.

                                        o If  you create the metric after 6 PM
                                          (PST), you get the first aggregation
                                          result at 6 PM (PST) the next day.

                               computed  at the edge or in the Amazon Web Ser-
                               vices Cloud. By default, metrics are  forwarded
                               to the cloud.

                               computeLocation -> (string)
