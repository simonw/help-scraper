CREATE-ASSET-MODEL()                                      CREATE-ASSET-MODEL()



NAME
       create-asset-model -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  asset  model from specified property and hierarchy defini-
       tions. You create assets from asset models. With asset models, you  can
       easily  create  assets  of the same type that have standardized defini-
       tions. Each asset created from a model inherits the asset model's prop-
       erty  and hierarchy definitions. For more information, see Defining as-
       set models in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --asset-model-name (string)
          A unique, friendly name for the asset model.

       --asset-model-description (string)
          A description for the asset model.

       --asset-model-properties (list)
          The property definitions of the asset model. For  more  information,
          see Asset properties in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

          You  can  specify up to 200 properties per asset model. For more in-
          formation, see Quotas in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

          (structure)
              Contains an asset model property definition. This property defi-
              nition is applied to all assets created from the asset model.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the property definition.

              dataType -> (string)
                 The data type of the property definition.

                 If you specify STRUCT , you must also specify dataTypeSpec to
                 identify the type of the structure for this property.

              dataTypeSpec -> (string)
                 The data type of the structure for this property. This param-
                 eter  is  required  on  properties  that have the STRUCT data
                 type.

                 The options for this parameter depend on the type of the com-
                 posite   model   in  which  you  define  this  property.  Use
                 AWS/ALARM_STATE for alarm state in alarm composite models.

              unit -> (string)
                 The unit of the property definition, such as Newtons or RPM .

              type -> (structure)
                 The property definition type (see  PropertyType  ).  You  can
                 only specify one type in a property definition.

                 attribute -> (structure)
                     Specifies  an asset attribute property. An attribute gen-
                     erally contains static information, such  as  the  serial
                     number of an IIoT wind turbine.

                     defaultValue -> (string)
                        The  default  value of the asset model property attri-
                        bute. All assets that you create from the asset  model
                        contain this attribute value. You can update an attri-
                        bute's value after you create an asset. For  more  in-
                        formation,  see  Updating  attribute values in the IoT
                        SiteWise User Guide .

                 measurement -> (structure)
                     Specifies an asset measurement  property.  A  measurement
                     represents  a  device's  raw  sensor data stream, such as
                     timestamped temperature values or timestamped power  val-
                     ues.

                     processingConfig -> (structure)
                        The processing configuration for the given measurement
                        property. You can configure measurements to be kept at
                        the  edge  or  forwarded  to  the  Amazon Web Services
                        Cloud. By default, measurements are forwarded  to  the
                        cloud.

                        forwardingConfig -> (structure)
                            The  forwarding  configuration  for the given mea-
                            surement property.

                            state -> (string)
                               The forwarding state for the given property.

                 transform -> (structure)
                     Specifies an asset transform property. A  transform  con-
                     tains  a  mathematical  expression that maps a property's
                     data points from one form to another, such as a unit con-
                     version from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

                     expression -> (string)
                        The mathematical expression that defines the transfor-
                        mation function. You can specify up  to  10  variables
                        per expression. You can specify up to 10 functions per
                        expression.

                        For more information, see Quotas in the  IoT  SiteWise
                        User Guide .

                     variables -> (list)
                        The list of variables used in the expression.

                        (structure)
                            Contains expression variable information.

                            name -> (string)
                               The friendly name of the variable to be used in
                               the expression.

                            value -> (structure)
                               The variable that identifies an asset  property
                               from which to use values.

                               propertyId -> (string)
                                   The  ID of the property to use as the vari-
                                   able. You can use the property name if it's
                                   from the same asset model.

                               hierarchyId -> (string)
                                   The  ID  of  the hierarchy to query for the
                                   property ID. You can  use  the  hierarchy's
                                   name instead of the hierarchy's ID.

                                   You  use  a hierarchy ID instead of a model
                                   ID because you can have several hierarchies
                                   using the same model and therefore the same
                                   propertyId . For example,  you  might  have
                                   separately  grouped  assets  that come from
                                   the same asset model. For more information,
                                   see  Asset  hierarchies in the IoT SiteWise
                                   User Guide .

                     processingConfig -> (structure)
                        The processing configuration for the  given  transform
                        property.  You  can configure transforms to be kept at
                        the edge or  forwarded  to  the  Amazon  Web  Services
                        Cloud.  You  can  also configure transforms to be com-
                        puted at the edge or in the cloud.

                 metric -> (structure)
                     Specifies  an  asset metric property. A metric contains a
                     mathematical expression that uses aggregate functions  to
                     process  all  input  data points over a time interval and
                     output a single data point, such as to calculate the  av-
                     erage hourly temperature.

                     expression -> (string)
                        The  mathematical  expression  that defines the metric
                        aggregation function. You can specify up to  10  vari-
                        ables  per  expression. You can specify up to 10 func-
                        tions per expression.

                     variables -> (list)
                        The list of variables used in the expression.

                        (structure)
                            Contains expression variable information.

                            name -> (string)
                               The friendly name of the variable to be used in
                               the expression.

                            value -> (structure)
                               The variable that identifies an asset  property
                               from which to use values.

                               propertyId -> (string)
                                   The  ID of the property to use as the vari-
                                   able. You can use the property name if it's
                                   from the same asset model.

                               hierarchyId -> (string)
                                   The  ID  of  the hierarchy to query for the
                                   property ID. You can  use  the  hierarchy's
                                   name instead of the hierarchy's ID.

                                   You  use  a hierarchy ID instead of a model
                                   ID because you can have several hierarchies
                                   using the same model and therefore the same
                                   propertyId . For example,  you  might  have
                                   separately  grouped  assets  that come from
                                   the same asset model. For more information,
                                   see  Asset  hierarchies in the IoT SiteWise

                     window -> (structure)
                        The window (time interval)  over  which  IoT  SiteWise
                        computes  the  metric's  aggregation  expression.  IoT
                        SiteWise computes one data point per window .

                        tumbling -> (structure)
                            The tumbling time interval window.

                            interval -> (string)
                               The time interval for the tumbling window.  The
                               interval  time  must  be between 1 minute and 1
                               week.

                               IoT SiteWise computes the 1w interval  the  end
                               of  Sunday  at midnight each week (UTC), the 1d
                               interval at the end of  each  day  at  midnight
                               (UTC), the 1h interval at the end of each hour,
                               and so on.

                               When IoT SiteWise aggregates  data  points  for
                               metric computations, the start of each interval
                               is exclusive and the end of  each  interval  is
                               inclusive.  IoT  SiteWise  places  the computed
                               data point at the end of the interval.

                            offset -> (string)
                               The offset for the tumbling window. The  offset
                               parameter accepts the following:

                               o The  offset time. For example, if you specify
                                 18h for offset and  1d  for  interval  ,  IoT
                                 SiteWise  aggregates  data in one of the fol-
                                 lowing ways:

                                 o If you create the metric before or at 6  PM
                                   (UTC), you get the first aggregation result
                                   at 6 PM (UTC) on the day  when  you  create
                                   the metric.

                                 o If  you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC),
                                   you get the first aggregation result  at  6
                                   PM (UTC) the next day.

                               o The  ISO  8601  format.  For  example, if you
                                 specify PT18H for offset and 1d for  interval
                                 ,  IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of the
                                 following ways:

                                 o If you create the metric before or at 6  PM
                                   (UTC), you get the first aggregation result
                                   at 6 PM (UTC) on the day  when  you  create
                                   the metric.

                                 o If  you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC),
                                   you get the first aggregation result  at  6
                                   PM (UTC) the next day.

                               o The  24-hour clock. For example, if you spec-
                                 ify 00:03:00 for offset , 5m for  interval  ,
                                 and  you create the metric at 2 PM (UTC), you
                                 get the first aggregation result at  2:03  PM
                                 (UTC).  You get the second aggregation result
                                 at 2:08 PM (UTC).

                               o The offset time zone.  For  example,  if  you
                                 specify 2021-07-23T18:00-08 for offset and 1d
                                 for interval , IoT SiteWise  aggregates  data
                                 in one of the following ways:

                                 o If  you create the metric before or at 6 PM
                                   (PST), you get the first aggregation result
                                   at  6  PM  (PST) on the day when you create
                                   the metric.

                                 o If you create the metric after 6 PM  (PST),
                                   you  get  the first aggregation result at 6
                                   PM (PST) the next day.

       --asset-model-hierarchies (list)
          The hierarchy definitions of the asset model. Each hierarchy  speci-
          fies an asset model whose assets can be children of any other assets
          created from this asset model. For more information, see Asset hier-
          archies in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

          You  can  specify up to 10 hierarchies per asset model. For more in-
          formation, see Quotas in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

          ]

       --asset-model-composite-models (list)
          The composite asset models that are part of this asset  model.  Com-
          posite  asset  models are asset models that contain specific proper-
          ties. Each composite model has a type that  defines  the  properties
          that the composite model supports. Use composite asset models to de-
          fine alarms on this asset model.

          (structure)
              Contains a composite model definition in an  asset  model.  This

                 The asset property definitions for this composite model.

                 (structure)
                     Contains  an  asset model property definition. This prop-
                     erty definition is applied to all assets created from the
                     asset model.

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the property definition.

                     dataType -> (string)
                        The data type of the property definition.

                        If   you  specify  STRUCT  ,  you  must  also  specify
                        dataTypeSpec to identify the type of the structure for
                        this property.

                     dataTypeSpec -> (string)
                        The data type of the structure for this property. This
                        parameter is required  on  properties  that  have  the
                        STRUCT data type.

                        The  options  for this parameter depend on the type of
                        the composite model in which you define this property.
                        Use AWS/ALARM_STATE for alarm state in alarm composite
                        models.

                     unit -> (string)
                        The unit of the property definition, such  as  Newtons
                        or RPM .

                     type -> (structure)
                        The  property definition type (see PropertyType ). You
                        can only specify one type in a property definition.

                        attribute -> (structure)
                            Specifies an asset attribute property.  An  attri-
                            bute  generally  contains static information, such
                            as the serial number of an IIoT wind turbine.

                            defaultValue -> (string)
                               The default value of the asset  model  property
                               attribute.  All assets that you create from the
                               asset model contain this attribute  value.  You
                               can  update an attribute's value after you cre-
                               ate  an  asset.  For  more   information,   see
                               Updating  attribute  values in the IoT SiteWise

                               surement property. You can  configure  measure-
                               ments  to  be  kept at the edge or forwarded to
                               the Amazon Web Services Cloud. By default, mea-
                               surements are forwarded to the cloud.

                               forwardingConfig -> (structure)
                                   The  forwarding configuration for the given
                                   measurement property.

                        transform -> (structure)
                            Specifies an asset transform property. A transform
                            contains a mathematical  expression  that  maps  a
                            property's  data  points from one form to another,
                            such as a unit conversion from Celsius to  Fahren-
                            heit.

                            expression -> (string)
                               The  mathematical  expression  that defines the
                               transformation function. You can specify up  to
                               10 variables per expression. You can specify up
                               to 10 functions per expression.

                                      The  friendly name of the variable to be
                                      used in the expression.

                                   value -> (structure)
                                      The variable that  identifies  an  asset
                                      property from which to use values.

                                      propertyId -> (string)
                                          The ID of the property to use as the
                                          variable. You can use  the  property
                                          name  if  it's  from  the same asset
                                          model.

                                      hierarchyId -> (string)
                                          The ID of the hierarchy to query for
                                          the property ID. You can use the hi-
                                          erarchy's name instead of the  hier-
                                          archy's ID.

                                          You  use a hierarchy ID instead of a
                                          model ID because you can  have  sev-
                                          eral   hierarchies  using  the  same
                                          model and therefore the same proper-
                                          tyId  .  For example, you might have
                                          separately grouped assets that  come
                                          from  the same asset model. For more
                                          information, see  Asset  hierarchies

                                      used in the expression.

                                   value -> (structure)
                                      The  variable  that  identifies an asset
                                      property from which to use values.

                                      propertyId -> (string)
                                          The ID of the property to use as the
                                          variable.  You  can use the property
                                          name if it's  from  the  same  asset
                                          model.

                                      hierarchyId -> (string)
                                          The ID of the hierarchy to query for
                                          the property ID. You can use the hi-
                                          erarchy's  name instead of the hier-
                                          archy's ID.

                                          You use a hierarchy ID instead of  a
                                          model  ID  because you can have sev-
                                          eral  hierarchies  using  the   same
                                          model and therefore the same proper-
                                          tyId . For example, you  might  have
                                          separately  grouped assets that come
                                          from the same asset model. For  more
                                          information,  see  Asset hierarchies
                                          in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

                            window -> (structure)
                               The window (time interval) over which IoT Site-
                               Wise  computes the metric's aggregation expres-
                               sion. IoT SiteWise computes one data point  per
                               window .

                               tumbling -> (structure)
                                   The tumbling time interval window.

                                   interval -> (string)
                                      The  time interval for the tumbling win-
                                      dow. The interval time must be between 1
                                      minute and 1 week.

                                      IoT  SiteWise  computes  the 1w interval
                                      the end of Sunday at midnight each  week
                                      (UTC),  the  1d  interval  at the end of
                                      each day at midnight (UTC), the  1h  in-
                                      terval  at  the end of each hour, and so
                                      on.

                                      When IoT SiteWise aggregates data points
                                      for  metric  computations,  the start of
                                      each interval is exclusive and  the  end
                                      of each interval is inclusive. IoT Site-
                                      Wise places the computed data  point  at
                                      the end of the interval.

                                   offset -> (string)
                                      The  offset for the tumbling window. The
                                      offset parameter accepts the following:

                                      o The offset time. For example,  if  you
                                        specify  18h for offset and 1d for in-
                                        terval , IoT SiteWise aggregates  data
                                        in one of the following ways:

                                        o If  you  create the metric before or
                                          at 6 PM (UTC), you get the first ag-
                                          gregation  result  at  6 PM (UTC) on
                                          the day when you create the metric.

                                        o If you create the metric after 6  PM
                                          (UTC), you get the first aggregation
                                          result at 6 PM (UTC) the next day.

                                      o The ISO 8601 format. For  example,  if
                                        you  specify  PT18H  for offset and 1d
                                        for interval , IoT SiteWise aggregates
                                        data in one of the following ways:

                                        o If  you  create the metric before or
                                          at 6 PM (UTC), you get the first ag-
                                          gregation  result  at  6 PM (UTC) on
                                          the day when you create the metric.

                                        o If you create the metric after 6  PM
                                          (UTC), you get the first aggregation
                                          result at 6 PM (UTC) the next day.

                                      o The 24-hour clock. For example, if you
                                        specify  00:03:00  for offset , 5m for
                                        interval , and you create  the  metric
                                        at  2  PM (UTC), you get the first ag-
                                        gregation result at 2:03 PM (UTC). You
                                        get  the  second aggregation result at
                                        2:08 PM (UTC).

                                      o The offset time zone. For example,  if
                                        you  specify  2021-07-23T18:00-08  for
                                        offset and 1d for interval , IoT Site-
                                        Wise  aggregates  data  in  one of the
                                        following ways:

                                        o If you create the metric  before  or
                                          at 6 PM (PST), you get the first ag-
                                          gregation result at 6  PM  (PST)  on
                                          the day when you create the metric.

                                        o If  you create the metric after 6 PM
                                          (PST), you get the first aggregation
                                          result at 6 PM (PST) the next day.

                            processingConfig -> (structure)

                               computed  at the edge or in the Amazon Web Ser-
                               vices Cloud. By default, metrics are  forwarded
                               to the cloud.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create an asset model

       The following create-asset-model example creates an  asset  model  that
       defines a wind turbine with the following properties:

       o Serial number - The serial number of a wind turbine

       o Generated power - The generated power data stream from a wind turbine

       o Temperature  C  -  The temperature data stream from a wind turbine in
         Celsius

       o Temperature F - The mapped temperature data points  from  Celsius  to
         Fahrenheit
