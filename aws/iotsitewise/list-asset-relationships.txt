LIST-ASSET-RELATIONSHIPS()                          LIST-ASSET-RELATIONSHIPS()



NAME
       list-asset-relationships -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a paginated list of asset relationships for an asset. You can
       use this operation to identify an asset's root asset and all associated
       assets between that asset and its root.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-asset-relationships  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: assetRelationshipSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-asset-relationships
          --asset-id <value>
          --traversal-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --asset-id (string)
          The ID of the asset.

       --traversal-type (string)
          The type of traversal to use to identify asset relationships. Choose
          the following option:

          o PATH_TO_ROOT   Identify  the  asset's parent assets up to the root
            asset. The asset that you specify in assetId is the  first  result
            in  the list of assetRelationshipSummaries , and the root asset is
            the last result.

          Possible values:

          o PATH_TO_ROOT

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       assetRelationshipSummaries -> (list)
          A list that summarizes each asset relationship.

          (structure)
              Contains information about assets that are related  to  one  an-
              other.

              hierarchyInfo -> (structure)
                 The assets that are related through an asset hierarchy.

                 This object is present if the relationshipType is HIERARCHY .

                 parentAssetId -> (string)
                     The ID of the parent asset in this asset relationship.

                 childAssetId -> (string)
                     The ID of the child asset in this asset relationship.

              relationshipType -> (string)
                 The  relationship  type  of  the assets in this relationship.
                 This value is one of the following:

                 o HIERARCHY  The assets are related through an asset  hierar-
                   chy.  If you specify this relationship type, this asset re-
                   lationship includes the hierarchyInfo object.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results, or null if there are no addi-
          tional results.
