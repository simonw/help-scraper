LIST-TIME-SERIES()                                          LIST-TIME-SERIES()



NAME
       list-time-series -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a paginated list of time series (data streams).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-time-series  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: TimeSeriesSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-time-series
          [--asset-id <value>]
          [--alias-prefix <value>]
          [--time-series-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --asset-id (string)
          The ID of the asset in which the asset property was created.

       --alias-prefix (string)
          The alias prefix of the time series.

       --time-series-type (string)
          The type of the time series. The time series type can be one of  the
          following values:

          o ASSOCIATED  The time series is associated with an asset property.

          o DISASSOCIATED   The  time  series  isn't associated with any asset
            property.

          Possible values:

          o ASSOCIATED

          o DISASSOCIATED

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TimeSeriesSummaries -> (list)
          One or more time series summaries to list.

          (structure)
              Contains a summary of a time series (data stream).

              assetId -> (string)
                 The ID of the asset in which the asset property was created.

              propertyId -> (string)
                 The ID of the asset property.

              alias -> (string)
                 The alias that identifies the time series.

              timeSeriesId -> (string)
                 The ID of the time series.

              dataType -> (string)
                 The data type of the time series.

                 If you specify STRUCT , you must also specify dataTypeSpec to
                 identify the type of the structure for this time series.

              dataTypeSpec -> (string)
                 The data type of the structure for this time series. This pa-
                 rameter is required for time series that have the STRUCT data
                 type.

                 The options for this parameter depend on the type of the com-
                 posite  model in which you created the asset property that is
                 associated with your time  series.  Use  AWS/ALARM_STATE  for
                 alarm state in alarm composite models.

              timeSeriesCreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  that  the  time  series was created, in Unix epoch
                 time.

              timeSeriesLastUpdateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date that the time series was last updated, in Unix epoch
                 time.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results, or null if there are no addi-
          tional results.
