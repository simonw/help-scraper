LIST-ASSETS()                                                    LIST-ASSETS()



NAME
       list-assets -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a paginated list of asset summaries.

       You can use this operation to do the following:

       o List assets based on a specific asset model.

       o List top-level assets.

       You  can't use this operation to list all assets. To retrieve summaries
       for all of your assets, use ListAssetModels to get all  of  your  asset
       model IDs. Then, use ListAssets to get all assets for each asset model.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-assets  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: assetSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-assets
          [--asset-model-id <value>]
          [--filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --asset-model-id (string)
          The ID of the asset model by which to filter  the  list  of  assets.
          This parameter is required if you choose ALL for filter .

       --filter (string)
          The  filter for the requested list of assets. Choose one of the fol-
          lowing options:

          o ALL  The list includes all assets for a given asset model ID.  The
            assetModelId parameter is required if you filter by ALL .

          o TOP_LEVEL   The  list  includes only top-level assets in the asset
            hierarchy tree.

          Default: ALL

          Possible values:

          o ALL

          o TOP_LEVEL

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
