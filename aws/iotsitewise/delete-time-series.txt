DELETE-TIME-SERIES()                                      DELETE-TIME-SERIES()



NAME
       delete-time-series -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a time series (data stream). If you delete a time series that's
       associated with an asset property, the asset property still exists, but
       the time series will no longer be associated with this asset property.

       To identify a time series, do one of the following:

       o If  the  time series isn't associated with an asset property, specify
         the alias of the time series.

       o If the time series is associated with an asset property, specify  one
         of the following:

         o The alias of the time series.

         o The assetId and propertyId that identifies the asset property.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-time-series
          [--alias <value>]
          [--asset-id <value>]
          [--property-id <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --alias (string)
          The alias that identifies the time series.

       --asset-id (string)
          The ID of the asset in which the asset property was created.

       --property-id (string)
          The ID of the asset property.

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique  case-sensitive  identifier that you can provide to ensure
          the idempotency of the request. Don't reuse this client token  if  a
          new idempotent request is required.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
