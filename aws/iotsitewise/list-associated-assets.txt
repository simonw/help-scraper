LIST-ASSOCIATED-ASSETS()                              LIST-ASSOCIATED-ASSETS()



NAME
       list-associated-assets -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a paginated list of associated assets.

       You can use this operation to do the following:

       o List  child  assets  associated to a parent asset by a hierarchy that
         you specify.

       o List an asset's parent asset.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-associated-assets is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: assetSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-associated-assets
          --asset-id <value>
          [--hierarchy-id <value>]
          [--traversal-direction <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --asset-id (string)
          The ID of the asset to query.

       --hierarchy-id (string)
          The  ID of the hierarchy by which child assets are associated to the
          asset.  To  find  a  hierarchy  ID,   use   the   DescribeAsset   or
          DescribeAssetModel  operations.  This  parameter  is required if you
          choose CHILD for traversalDirection .

          For more information, see Asset hierarchies in the IoT SiteWise User
          Guide .

       --traversal-direction (string)
          The direction to list associated assets. Choose one of the following
          options:

          o CHILD  The list includes all child assets associated to the asset.
            The hierarchyId parameter is required if you choose CHILD .

          o PARENT  The list includes the asset's parent asset.

          Default: CHILD

          Possible values:

          o PARENT

          o CHILD

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       sets associated to the specified wind farm asset.
