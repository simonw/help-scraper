DESCRIBE-GATEWAY()                                          DESCRIBE-GATEWAY()



NAME
       describe-gateway -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about a gateway.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-gateway
          --gateway-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-id (string)
          The ID of the gateway device.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a gateway

       The following describe-gateway example describes a gateway.

          aws iotsitewise describe-gateway \
              --gateway-id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-1a1a1EXAMPLE

OUTPUT
       gatewayId -> (string)
          The ID of the gateway device.

       gatewayName -> (string)
          The name of the gateway.

       gatewayArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the gateway, which has the following format.
              arn:${Partition}:iotsitewise:${Region}:${Account}:gate-
              way/${GatewayId}

       gatewayPlatform -> (structure)
          The gateway's platform.

          greengrass -> (structure)
              A gateway that runs on IoT Greengrass.

              groupArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the Greengrass group. For more  information  about
                 how to find a group's ARN, see ListGroups and GetGroup in the
                 IoT Greengrass API Reference .

          greengrassV2 -> (structure)
              A gateway that runs on IoT Greengrass V2.

              coreDeviceThingName -> (string)
                 The name of the IoT thing for your IoT Greengrass V2 core de-
                 vice.

       gatewayCapabilitySummaries -> (list)
          A list of gateway capability summaries that each contain a namespace
          and status. Each gateway capability defines  data  sources  for  the
          gateway.  To  retrieve  a capability configuration's definition, use
          DescribeGatewayCapabilityConfiguration .

          (structure)
              Contains a summary of a gateway capability configuration.

              capabilityNamespace -> (string)
                 The namespace of the capability configuration.  For  example,
                 if  you  configure  OPC-UA sources from the IoT SiteWise con-
                 sole, your OPC-UA capability configuration has the  namespace
                 iotsitewise:opcuacollector:version  , where version is a num-
                 ber such as 1 .

              capabilitySyncStatus -> (string)
                 The synchronization status of the  capability  configuration.
                 The sync status can be one of the following:

                 o IN_SYNC   The  gateway is running the capability configura-
                   tion.

                 o OUT_OF_SYNC  The gateway  hasn't  received  the  capability
                   configuration.

                 o SYNC_FAILED  The gateway rejected the capability configura-
                   tion.

       creationDate -> (timestamp)
          The date the gateway was created, in Unix epoch time.

       lastUpdateDate -> (timestamp)
          The date the gateway was last updated, in Unix epoch time.
