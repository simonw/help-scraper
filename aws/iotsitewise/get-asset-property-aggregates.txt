GET-ASSET-PROPERTY-AGGREGATES()                GET-ASSET-PROPERTY-AGGREGATES()



NAME
       get-asset-property-aggregates -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets aggregated values for an asset property. For more information, see
       Querying aggregates in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

       To identify an asset property, you must specify one of the following:

       o The assetId and propertyId of an asset property.

       o A propertyAlias , which is a data stream alias  (for  example,  /com-
         pany/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature  ).  To  define  an asset prop-
         erty's alias, see UpdateAssetProperty .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-asset-property-aggregates is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: aggregatedValues

          The ID of the asset.

       --property-id (string)
          The ID of the asset property.

       --property-alias (string)
          The  alias  that  identifies  the property, such as an OPC-UA server
          data stream path (for example, /company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temper-
          ature  ).  For more information, see Mapping industrial data streams
          to asset properties in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

       --aggregate-types (list)
          The data aggregating function.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            AVERAGE
            COUNT
            MAXIMUM
            MINIMUM
            SUM
            STANDARD_DEVIATION

       --resolution (string)
          The time interval over which to aggregate data.

       --qualities (list)
          The quality by which to filter asset data.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            GOOD
            BAD
            UNCERTAIN

       --start-date (timestamp)
          The exclusive start of the range  from  which  to  query  historical
          data, expressed in seconds in Unix epoch time.

       --end-date (timestamp)
          The  inclusive end of the range from which to query historical data,
          expressed in seconds in Unix epoch time.

       --time-ordering (string)
          The chronological sorting order of the requested information.

          Default: ASCENDING

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve an asset property's aggregated average and count values

       The  following  get-asset-property-aggregates  example retrieves a wind
       turbine asset's average total power  and  count  of  total  power  data
       points for a 1 hour period in time.

          aws iotsitewise get-asset-property-aggregates \

              --property-id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-66666EXAMPLE \
              --start-date 1580849400 \

              --aggregate-types AVERAGE COUNT \
              --resolution 1h

       Output:

          {
              "aggregatedValues": [
                  {
                      "timestamp": 1580850000.0,
