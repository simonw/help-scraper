NAME
       create-global-replication-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Global Datastore for Redis offers fully managed, fast, reliable and se-
       cure cross-region replication. Using Global Datastore  for  Redis,  you
       can create cross-region read replica clusters for ElastiCache for Redis
       to enable low-latency reads and disaster recovery across  regions.  For
       more information, see Replication Across Regions Using Global Datastore
       .

       o The GlobalReplicationGroupIdSuffix is the name of the  Global  datas-
         tore.

       o The  PrimaryReplicationGroupId  represents  the  name  of the primary
         cluster that accepts writes and will replicate updates  to  the  sec-
         ondary cluster.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-global-replication-group
          --global-replication-group-id-suffix <value>
          [--global-replication-group-description <value>]
          --primary-replication-group-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-replication-group-id-suffix (string)
          The  suffix name of a Global datastore. Amazon ElastiCache automati-
          cally applies a prefix to the Global datastore ID when  it  is  cre-
          ated.  Each Amazon Region has its own prefix. For instance, a Global
          datastore ID created in the US-West-1 region will begin with "dsdfu"
          along  with  the  suffix name you provide. The suffix, combined with
          the auto-generated prefix, guarantees uniqueness of the Global data-
          store name across multiple regions.

          For a full list of Amazon Regions and their respective Global datas-
          tore iD prefixes, see Using the Amazon CLI with Global datastores .

       --global-replication-group-description (string)
          Provides details of the Global datastore

       --primary-replication-group-id (string)
          The name of the primary cluster that accepts writes and will  repli-
          cate updates to the secondary cluster.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a global replication group

       The  following  create-global-replication-group  example  creates a new
       global replication group.

          aws elasticache create-global-replication-group \
              --global-replication-group-id-suffix my-global-replication-group \
              --primary-replication-group-id my-primary-cluster
