NAME
       describe-global-replication-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about a particular global replication group. If no
       identifier is specified, returns information about  all  Global  datas-
       tores.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-global-replication-groups  is  a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: GlobalReplicationGroups

SYNOPSIS
            describe-global-replication-groups
          [--global-replication-group-id <value>]
          [--show-member-info | --no-show-member-info]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-replication-group-id (string)
          The name of the Global datastore

       --show-member-info | --no-show-member-info (boolean)
          Returns the list of members that comprise the Global datastore.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          An optional marker returned from a prior request.  Use  this  marker
          for  pagination of results from this operation. If this parameter is
          specified, the response includes only records beyond the marker,  up
          to the value specified by MaxRecords. >

       GlobalReplicationGroups -> (list)
          Indicates  the  slot  configuration  and  global identifier for each
          slice group.

          (structure)
              Consists of a primary cluster that accepts writes and an associ-
              ated  secondary  cluster  that resides in a different Amazon re-
              gion. The secondary cluster  accepts  only  reads.  The  primary
              cluster  automatically replicates updates to the secondary clus-
              ter.

              o The GlobalReplicationGroupIdSuffix represents the name of  the

                 abled to true when you create the replication group.
                     Required: Only  available  when  creating  a  replication
                     group in an Amazon VPC using redis version 3.2.6 , 4.x or
                     later.
