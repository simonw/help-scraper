CREATE-REPLICATION-GROUP()                          CREATE-REPLICATION-GROUP()



NAME
       create-replication-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  Redis  (cluster mode disabled) or a Redis (cluster mode en-
       abled) replication group.

       This API can be used to create a standalone regional replication  group
       or a secondary replication group associated with a Global datastore.

       A  Redis  (cluster  mode disabled) replication group is a collection of
       clusters, where one of the clusters is a  read/write  primary  and  the
       others are read-only replicas. Writes to the primary are asynchronously
       propagated to the replicas.

       A Redis cluster-mode enabled cluster is  comprised  of  from  1  to  90
       shards  (API/CLI: node groups). Each shard has a primary node and up to
       5 read-only replica nodes. The configuration can range from  90  shards
       and 0 replicas to 15 shards and 5 replicas, which is the maximum number
       or replicas allowed.

       The node or shard limit can be increased to a maximum of 500 per  clus-
       ter  if  the  Redis engine version is 5.0.6 or higher. For example, you
       can choose to configure a 500  node  cluster  that  ranges  between  83
       shards  (one  primary  and 5 replicas per shard) and 500 shards (single
       primary and no replicas). Make sure there are enough available  IP  ad-
       dresses  to  accommodate the increase. Common pitfalls include the sub-
       nets in the subnet group have too small a CIDR range or the subnets are
       shared  and  heavily  used by other clusters. For more information, see
       Creating a Subnet Group . For versions below 5.0.6, the  limit  is  250
       per cluster.

       To  request  a limit increase, see Amazon Service Limits and choose the
       limit type Nodes per cluster per instance type .

       When a Redis (cluster mode disabled) replication group  has  been  suc-
       cessfully created, you can add one or more read replicas to it, up to a
       total of 5 read replicas. If you need to increase or decrease the  num-
       ber of node groups (console: shards), you can avail yourself of Elasti-
       Cache for Redis' scaling. For more information, see Scaling ElastiCache
       for Redis Clusters in the ElastiCache User Guide .

       NOTE:
          This operation is valid for Redis only.

OPTIONS
       --replication-group-id (string)
          The replication group identifier. This parameter is stored as a low-
          ercase string.

          Constraints:

          o A name must contain from 1 to 40 alphanumeric  characters  or  hy-
            phens.

          o The first character must be a letter.

          o A  name  cannot  end  with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hy-
            phens.

       --replication-group-description (string)
          A user-created description for the replication group.

       --global-replication-group-id (string)
          The name of the Global datastore

       --primary-cluster-id (string)
          The identifier of the cluster that serves as the  primary  for  this
          replication group. This cluster must already exist and have a status
          of available .

          This parameter is not required if NumCacheClusters , NumNodeGroups ,
          or ReplicasPerNodeGroup is specified.

       --automatic-failover-enabled  |  --no-automatic-failover-enabled (bool-
       ean)
          Specifies whether a read-only replica is automatically  promoted  to
          read/write primary if the existing primary fails.
              AutomaticFailoverEnabled must be enabled for Redis (cluster mode
              enabled) replication groups.

          Default: false

       --multi-az-enabled | --no-multi-az-enabled (boolean)
          A flag indicating if you have Multi-AZ enabled to enhance fault tol-
          erance. For more information, see Minimizing Downtime: Multi-AZ .

       --num-cache-clusters (integer)
          The number of clusters this replication group initially has.

          This  parameter  is  not  used  if there is more than one node group
          (shard). You should use ReplicasPerNodeGroup instead.

          If AutomaticFailoverEnabled is true , the value  of  this  parameter
          must  be  at  least  2. If AutomaticFailoverEnabled is false you can
          omit this parameter (it will default to 1), or  you  can  explicitly
          set it to a value between 2 and 6.

          The  maximum  permitted  value  for NumCacheClusters is 6 (1 primary
          plus 5 replicas).

       --preferred-cache-cluster-azs (list)
          A list of EC2 Availability Zones in which  the  replication  group's
          clusters  are  created.  The  order of the Availability Zones in the
          list is the order in which clusters are allocated. The primary clus-
          ter is created in the first AZ in the list.

          This  parameter  is  not  used  if there is more than one node group
          (shard). You should use NodeGroupConfiguration instead.

          NOTE:
              If you are creating your replication  group  in  an  Amazon  VPC
              (recommended),  you  can  only  locate  clusters in Availability
              Zones associated with the subnets in the selected subnet group.

              The number of Availability Zones listed must equal the value  of
              NumCacheClusters .

          Default: system chosen Availability Zones.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --num-node-groups (integer)
          An  optional  parameter  that  specifies  the  number of node groups
          (shards) for this Redis (cluster mode  enabled)  replication  group.
          For  Redis (cluster mode disabled) either omit this parameter or set
          it to 1.

          Default: 1

       --replicas-per-node-group (integer)
          An optional parameter that specifies the number of replica nodes  in
          each node group (shard). Valid values are 0 to 5.

       --node-group-configuration (list)
          A  list of node group (shard) configuration options. Each node group
          (shard) configuration has the following members:  PrimaryAvailabili-
          tyZone , ReplicaAvailabilityZones , ReplicaCount , and Slots .

          If you're creating a Redis (cluster mode disabled) or a Redis (clus-
          ter mode enabled) replication group, you can use this  parameter  to
          individually configure each node group (shard), or you can omit this
          parameter. However, it is required when  seeding  a  Redis  (cluster
          mode  enabled)  cluster  from a S3 rdb file. You must configure each
          node group (shard) using this parameter because you must specify the
          slots for each node group.

          (structure)
              Node  group  (shard)  configuration  options.  Each  node  group
              (shard) configuration has the following: Slots  ,  PrimaryAvail-
              abilityZone , ReplicaAvailabilityZones , ReplicaCount .

              NodeGroupId -> (string)
                 Either  the  ElastiCache  for  Redis supplied 4-digit id or a
                 user supplied id for the node group these configuration  val-
                 ues apply to.

              Slots -> (string)
                 A  string  that  specifies the keyspace for a particular node
                 group. Keyspaces range from 0 to 16,383. The string is in the
                 format startkey-endkey .

                 Example: "0-3999"

              ReplicaCount -> (integer)
                 The number of read replica nodes in this node group (shard).

              PrimaryAvailabilityZone -> (string)
                 The  Availability  Zone  where  the primary node of this node
                 group (shard) is launched.

              ReplicaAvailabilityZones -> (list)
                 A list of Availability Zones to be used for the  read  repli-
                 cas. The number of Availability Zones in this list must match
                 the value of  ReplicaCount  or  ReplicasPerNodeGroup  if  not
                 specified.

                 (string)

              PrimaryOutpostArn -> (string)
                 The outpost ARN of the primary node.

              ReplicaOutpostArns -> (list)
                 The outpost ARN of the node replicas.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          NodeGroupId=string,Slots=string,ReplicaCount=integer,PrimaryAvailabilityZone=string,ReplicaAvailabilityZones=string,string,PrimaryOutpostArn=string,ReplicaOutpostArns=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "NodeGroupId": "string",
              "Slots": "string",
              "ReplicaCount": integer,
              "PrimaryAvailabilityZone": "string",

            }
            ...
          ]

       --cache-node-type (string)
          The  compute  and  memory  capacity  of  the nodes in the node group
          (shard).

          The following node types are  supported  by  ElastiCache.  Generally
          speaking,  the current generation types provide more memory and com-
          putational power at lower cost when  compared  to  their  equivalent
          previous generation counterparts.

       --engine (string)
          The  name  of  the  cache engine to be used for the clusters in this
          replication group. Must be Redis.

       --engine-version (string)
          The version number of the cache engine to be used for  the  clusters
          in  this  replication group. To view the supported cache engine ver-
          sions, use the DescribeCacheEngineVersions operation.
              Important: You can  upgrade  to  a  newer  engine  version  (see
              Selecting  a  Cache Engine and Version ) in the ElastiCache User
              Guide , but you cannot downgrade to an earlier  engine  version.
              If  you  want  to use an earlier engine version, you must delete
              the existing cluster or replication group  and  create  it  anew
              with the earlier engine version.

       --cache-parameter-group-name (string)
          The  name  of the parameter group to associate with this replication
          group. If this argument is  omitted,  the  default  cache  parameter
          group for the specified engine is used.

          If you are running Redis version 3.2.4 or later, only one node group
          (shard), and want to use a default  parameter  group,  we  recommend
          that you specify the parameter group by name.

          o To  create  a Redis (cluster mode disabled) replication group, use
            CacheParameterGroupName=default.redis3.2 .

          o To create a Redis (cluster mode enabled)  replication  group,  use
            CacheParameterGroupName=default.redis3.2.cluster.on .

       --cache-subnet-group-name (string)
          The  name  of  the cache subnet group to be used for the replication
          group.

          WARNING:
              If you're going to launch your cluster in  an  Amazon  VPC,  you
              need  to create a subnet group before you start creating a clus-
              ter. For more information, see Subnets and Subnet Groups .

       --cache-security-group-names (list)
          A list of cache security group names to associate with this replica-
          tion group.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --security-group-ids (list)
          One or more Amazon VPC security groups associated with this replica-
          tion group.

          Use this parameter only when you are creating a replication group in
          an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  tags to be added to this resource. Tags are comma-sepa-
          rated key,value pairs (e.g. Key=``myKey`` ,  Value=``myKeyValue``  .
          You  can  include  multiple tags as shown following: Key=``myKey`` ,
          Value=``myKeyValue``  Key=``mySecondKey``   ,   Value=``mySecondKey-
          Value``  .  Tags  on  replication  groups  will be replicated to all
          nodes.

          (structure)
              A tag that can be added to an ElastiCache cluster or replication
              group.  Tags  are composed of a Key/Value pair. You can use tags
              to categorize and track all your ElastiCache resources, with the
              exception  of  global  replication group. When you add or remove
              tags on replication groups, those actions will be replicated  to
              all  nodes  in the replication group. A tag with a null Value is

              retained for 5 days before being deleted.

              WARNING:
                 If the value of SnapshotRetentionLimit is set  to  zero  (0),
