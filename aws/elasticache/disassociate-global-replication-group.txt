NAME
       disassociate-global-replication-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Remove  a  secondary cluster from the Global datastore using the Global
       datastore name. The secondary cluster will no  longer  receive  updates
       from  the  primary  cluster, but will remain as a standalone cluster in
       that Amazon region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-global-replication-group
          --global-replication-group-id <value>
          --replication-group-id <value>
          --replication-group-region <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-replication-group-id (string)
          The name of the Global datastore

       --replication-group-id (string)
          The name of the secondary cluster you wish to remove from the Global
          datastore

       --replication-group-region (string)
          The  Amazon  region of secondary cluster you wish to remove from the
          Global datastore

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To diassociate a secondary cluster from a global replication group

       The following disassociate-global-replication-group example  removes  a
       secondary cluster from a Global datastore

          aws elasticache disassociate-global-replication-group \
              --global-replication-group-id my-grg \
              --replication-group-id my-cluster-grg-secondary \
              --replication-group-region us-east-1

       Output:

          {

OUTPUT
       GlobalReplicationGroup -> (structure)
          Consists of a primary cluster that accepts writes and an  associated
          secondary  cluster  that  resides  in a different Amazon region. The
          secondary cluster accepts only reads. The primary cluster  automati-
          cally replicates updates to the secondary cluster.

          o The  GlobalReplicationGroupIdSuffix  represents  the  name  of the
            Global datastore, which is what you use to associate  a  secondary
            cluster.

              you must set TransitEncryptionEnabled to true when you create  a
              cluster.
