NAME
       copy-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Makes a copy of an existing snapshot.

       NOTE:
          This operation is valid for Redis only.

       WARNING:
          Users or groups that have permissions to use the CopySnapshot opera-
          tion can create their own Amazon S3 buckets and  copy  snapshots  to
          it.  To  control access to your snapshots, use an IAM policy to con-
          trol who has the ability to use the CopySnapshot operation. For more
          information about using IAM to control the use of ElastiCache opera-
          tions, see Exporting Snapshots and Authentication & Access Control .

       You could receive the following error messages.
          Error Messages

       o Error Message: The S3 bucket %s is outside of the region.   Solution:
         Create  an  Amazon S3 bucket in the same region as your snapshot. For
         more information, see Step 1: Create an Amazon S3 Bucket in the Elas-
         tiCache User Guide.

       o Error  Message: The S3 bucket %s does not exist.  Solution: Create an
         Amazon S3 bucket in the same region as your snapshot. For more infor-
         mation,  see  Step  1:  Create an Amazon S3 Bucket in the ElastiCache
         User Guide.

       o Error Message: The S3 bucket %s is not  owned  by  the  authenticated
         user.   Solution:  Create  an  Amazon S3 bucket in the same region as
         your snapshot. For more information, see Step 1: Create an Amazon  S3
         Bucket in the ElastiCache User Guide.

       o Error  Message:  The authenticated user does not have sufficient per-
         missions to perform the desired  activity.   Solution:  Contact  your
         system administrator to get the needed permissions.

       o Error  Message:  The S3 bucket %s already contains an object with key
         %s.  Solution: Give the TargetSnapshotName a new and unique value. If
         exporting  a snapshot, you could alternatively create a new Amazon S3
         bucket and use this same value for TargetSnapshotName .

       o Error Message: ElastiCache has not been granted READ  permissions  %s
         on  the  S3  Bucket.   Solution: Add List and Read permissions on the
         bucket. For more information, see Step 2: Grant ElastiCache Access to
         Your Amazon S3 Bucket in the ElastiCache User Guide.

       o Error  Message: ElastiCache has not been granted WRITE permissions %s
         on the S3 Bucket.  Solution: Add  Upload/Delete  permissions  on  the
         bucket. For more information, see Step 2: Grant ElastiCache Access to
         Your Amazon S3 Bucket in the ElastiCache User Guide.

       o Error Message: ElastiCache has not been granted READ_ACP  permissions
         %s  on  the S3 Bucket.  Solution: Add View Permissions on the bucket.
         For more information, see Step 2: Grant ElastiCache  Access  to  Your
         Amazon S3 Bucket in the ElastiCache User Guide.

SYNOPSIS
            copy-snapshot
          --source-snapshot-name <value>
          --target-snapshot-name <value>
          [--target-bucket <value>]
          [--kms-key-id <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-snapshot-name (string)
          The name of an existing snapshot from which to make a copy.

       --target-snapshot-name (string)
          A  name for the snapshot copy. ElastiCache does not permit overwrit-
          ing a snapshot, therefore this name must be unique within  its  con-
          text - ElastiCache or an Amazon S3 bucket if exporting.

       --target-bucket (string)
          The Amazon S3 bucket to which the snapshot is exported. This parame-
          ter is used only when exporting a snapshot for external access.

          When using this parameter to export a snapshot, be sure Amazon Elas-
          tiCache  has  the needed permissions to this S3 bucket. For more in-
          formation, see Step 2: Grant ElastiCache Access to  Your  Amazon  S3
          Bucket in the Amazon ElastiCache User Guide .

          For more information, see Exporting a Snapshot in the Amazon Elasti-
          Cache User Guide .

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The ID of the KMS key used to encrypt the target snapshot.

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags to be added to this resource. A tag  is  a  key-value
          pair. A tag key must be accompanied by a tag value, although null is
          accepted.

          (structure)
              A tag that can be added to an ElastiCache cluster or replication
              group.  Tags  are composed of a Key/Value pair. You can use tags
              to categorize and track all your ElastiCache resources, with the
              exception  of  global  replication group. When you add or remove
              tags on replication groups, those actions will be replicated  to
              all  nodes  in the replication group. A tag with a null Value is
              permitted.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the tag. May not be null.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag's value. May be null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Snapshot -> (structure)
          Represents a copy of an entire Redis cluster as of the time when the
          snapshot was taken.

          SnapshotName -> (string)
              The name of a snapshot. For an automatic snapshot, the  name  is
              system-generated.  For  a manual snapshot, this is the user-pro-
              vided name.

          ReplicationGroupId -> (string)
              The unique identifier of the source replication group.

          ReplicationGroupDescription -> (string)
              A description of the source replication group.

          CacheClusterId -> (string)
              The user-supplied identifier of the source cluster.

          SnapshotStatus -> (string)
              The status of the snapshot. Valid values: creating | available |
              restoring | copying | deleting .

          SnapshotSource -> (string)
              Indicates  whether the snapshot is from an automatic backup (au-
              tomated ) or was created manually (manual ).

          CacheNodeType -> (string)
              The name of the compute and memory capacity node  type  for  the
              source cluster.

              The following node types are supported by ElastiCache. Generally
              speaking, the current generation types provide more  memory  and
              computational power at lower cost when compared to their equiva-
              lent previous generation counterparts.

          AutoMinorVersionUpgrade -> (boolean)
              If  you  are running Redis engine version 6.0 or later, set this
              parameter to yes if you want to opt-in to the  next  auto  minor
              version  upgrade campaign. This parameter is disabled for previ-
              ous versions.

          SnapshotRetentionLimit -> (integer)
              For an automatic snapshot, the number of days for which  Elasti-
              Cache retains the snapshot before deleting it.

              Limit for the source cluster when the snapshot was created. This
              field  is otherwise ignored: Manual snapshots do not expire, and
              can only be deleted using the DeleteSnapshot operation.
                 Important If the value of SnapshotRetentionLimit  is  set  to
                 zero (0), backups are turned off.

          SnapshotWindow -> (string)

              The number of  node  groups  (shards)  in  this  snapshot.  When
              restoring from a snapshot, the number of node groups (shards) in
              the snapshot and in the restored replication group must  be  the
              same.

          AutomaticFailover -> (string)
              Indicates  the status of automatic failover for the source Redis
              replication group.

          NodeSnapshots -> (list)
              A list of the cache nodes in the source cluster.

              (structure)
                 Represents an individual cache node in a snapshot of a  clus-
                 ter.
