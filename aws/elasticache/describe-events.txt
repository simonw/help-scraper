DESCRIBE-EVENTS()                                            DESCRIBE-EVENTS()



NAME
       describe-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  events  related  to clusters, cache security groups, and cache
       parameter groups. You can obtain events specific to a particular  clus-
       ter,  cache  security  group, or cache parameter group by providing the
       name as a parameter.

       By default, only the events occurring within  the  last  hour  are  re-
       turned;  however,  you  can  retrieve up to 14 days' worth of events if
       necessary.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-events is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Events

SYNOPSIS
            describe-events
          [--source-identifier <value>]
          [--source-type <value>]
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--duration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the event source for which events are returned. If
          not specified, all sources are included in the response.

       --source-type (string)
          The event source to retrieve events for. If no value  is  specified,
          all events are returned.

          Possible values:

          o cache-cluster

          o cache-parameter-group

          o cache-security-group

          o cache-subnet-group

          o replication-group

          o user

          o user-group

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The beginning of the time interval to retrieve events for, specified
          in ISO 8601 format.
              Example: 2017-03-30T07:03:49.555Z

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end of the time interval for which to retrieve events, specified
          in ISO 8601 format.
              Example: 2017-03-30T07:03:49.555Z

       --duration (integer)
          The number of minutes worth of events to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe events of a replication group

       The  following  describe-events  example returns a list of events for a
       replication group.

          aws elasticache describe-events \
              --source-identifier test-cluster \
              --source-type replication-group

       Output:

          {
              "Events": [
                  {
                      "SourceIdentifier": "test-cluster",
                      "SourceType": "replication-group",
                      "Message": "Automatic failover has been turned on for replication group test-cluster",
                      "Date": "2020-03-18T23:51:34.457Z"
                  },
                  {
                      "SourceIdentifier": "test-cluster",
                      "SourceType": "replication-group",
                      "Message": "Replication group test-cluster created",
                      "Date": "2020-03-18T23:50:31.378Z"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          Provides an identifier to allow retrieval of paginated results.

       Events -> (list)
          A  list of events. Each element in the list contains detailed infor-
          mation about one event.

          (structure)
              Represents a single occurrence of something  interesting  within
              the  system.  Some  examples  of  events are creating a cluster,
              adding or removing a cache node, or rebooting a node.

              SourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 The identifier for the source of the event. For  example,  if
                 the event occurred at the cluster level, the identifier would
                 be the name of the cluster.

              SourceType -> (string)
                 Specifies the origin of this event - a cluster,  a  parameter
                 group, a security group, etc.

              Message -> (string)
                 The text of the event.

              Date -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the event occurred.
