DELETE-GLOBAL-REPLICATION-GROUP()            DELETE-GLOBAL-REPLICATION-GROUP()



NAME
       delete-global-replication-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Deleting a Global datastore is a two-step process:

       o First,  you  must   DisassociateGlobalReplicationGroup  to remove the
         secondary clusters in the Global datastore.

       o Once the Global datastore contains only the primary cluster, you  can
         use  the DeleteGlobalReplicationGroup API to delete the Global datas-
         tore while retainining the primary cluster using  RetainPrimaryRepli-
         cationGroup=true .

       Since  the  Global Datastore has only a primary cluster, you can delete
       the Global Datastore while retaining the primary by setting  RetainPri-
       maryReplicationGroup=true  .  The primary cluster is never deleted when
       deleting a Global Datastore. It can only be deleted when it  no  longer
       is associated with any Global Datastore.

       When  you  receive  a  successful  response from this operation, Amazon
       ElastiCache immediately begins deleting  the  selected  resources;  you
       cannot cancel or revert this operation.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-global-replication-group
          --global-replication-group-id <value>
          --retain-primary-replication-group | --no-retain-primary-replication-group
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-replication-group-id (string)
          The name of the Global datastore

       --retain-primary-replication-group    |    --no-retain-primary-replica-
       tion-group (boolean)
          The primary replication group is retained as a  standalone  replica-
          tion group.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a global replication group

       The following delete-global-replication-group  example  deletes  a  new
       global replication group.

          aws elasticache delete-global-replication-group \
              --global-replication-group-id my-global-replication-group \
              --retain-primary-replication-group

       Output:

          {
              "GlobalReplicationGroup": {
                  "GlobalReplicationGroupId": "sgaui-my-grg",

                  "CacheNodeType": "cache.r5.large",
                  "Engine": "redis",
                  "EngineVersion": "5.0.6",
                  "Members": [
                      {
                          "ReplicationGroupId": "my-cluster-grg",
                          "ReplicationGroupRegion": "us-west-2",
                          "Role": "PRIMARY",

                          "Status": "associated"
                      }
                  ],
                  "ClusterEnabled": false,
                  "AuthTokenEnabled": false,
                  "TransitEncryptionEnabled": false,
                  "AtRestEncryptionEnabled": false
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       GlobalReplicationGroup -> (structure)
          Consists of a primary cluster that accepts writes and an  associated
          secondary  cluster  that  resides  in a different Amazon region. The
          secondary cluster accepts only reads. The primary cluster  automati-
          cally replicates updates to the secondary cluster.

          o The  GlobalReplicationGroupIdSuffix  represents  the  name  of the
            Global datastore, which is what you use to associate  a  secondary
            cluster.
