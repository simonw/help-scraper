OPTIONS
       --cache-cluster-id (string)
          The cluster identifier. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

       --num-cache-nodes (integer)
          The number of cache nodes that the cluster should have. If the value
          for NumCacheNodes is greater than the sum of the number  of  current
          cache  nodes  and  the number of cache nodes pending creation (which
          may be zero), more nodes are added. If the value is  less  than  the
          number  of  existing cache nodes, nodes are removed. If the value is
          equal to the number of current cache nodes, any pending add  or  re-
          move requests are canceled.

          If  you are removing cache nodes, you must use the CacheNodeIdsToRe-
          move parameter to provide the IDs of the specific cache nodes to re-
          move.

          For  clusters running Redis, this value must be 1. For clusters run-
          ning Memcached, this value must be between 1 and 40.

          NOTE:
              Adding or removing Memcached cache nodes can be applied  immedi-
              ately or as a pending operation (see ApplyImmediately ).

              A  pending  operation  to  modify the number of cache nodes in a
              cluster during its maintenance window, whether by adding or  re-
              moving  nodes  in accordance with the scale out architecture, is
              not queued. The customer's latest request to add or remove nodes
              to the cluster overrides any previous pending operations to mod-
              ify the number of cache nodes in the cluster. For example, a re-
              quest to remove 2 nodes would override a previous pending opera-
              tion to remove 3 nodes. Similarly, a  request  to  add  2  nodes
              would  override  a  previous pending operation to remove 3 nodes
              and vice versa. As Memcached cache nodes may now be  provisioned
              in  different Availability Zones with flexible cache node place-
              ment, a request to add nodes does not automatically  override  a
              previous pending operation to add nodes. The customer can modify
              the previous pending operation to add more nodes  or  explicitly
              cancel  the pending request and retry the new request. To cancel
              pending operations to modify the number  of  cache  nodes  in  a
              cluster,  use  the ModifyCacheCluster request and set NumCacheN-
              odes equal to the number of cache nodes currently in  the  clus-
              ter.

       --cache-node-ids-to-remove (list)
          A list of cache node IDs to be removed. A node ID is a numeric iden-
          tifier (0001, 0002, etc.). This parameter is only  valid  when  Num-
          CacheNodes is less than the existing number of cache nodes. The num-
          ber of cache node IDs supplied in this parameter must match the dif-
          ference between the existing number of cache nodes in the cluster or
          pending cache nodes, whichever is greater, and  the  value  of  Num-
          CacheNodes in the request.

          For  example:  If  you  have  3  active cache nodes, 7 pending cache
          nodes, and the number of cache nodes in this ModifyCacheCluster call
          is 5, you must list 2 (7 - 5) cache node IDs to remove.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --az-mode (string)
          Specifies  whether  the  new nodes in this Memcached cluster are all
          created in a single Availability Zone  or  created  across  multiple
          Availability Zones.

          Valid values: single-az | cross-az .

          This option is only supported for Memcached clusters.

          NOTE:
              You  cannot  specify  single-az if the Memcached cluster already
              has cache nodes in different Availability Zones. If cross-az  is
              specified,  existing  Memcached  nodes  remain  in their current
              Availability Zone.

              Only newly created nodes are located in  different  Availability
              Zones.

          Possible values:

          o single-az

          o cross-az

       --new-availability-zones (list)

          NOTE:
              This option is only supported on Memcached clusters.

          The  list  of Availability Zones where the new Memcached cache nodes
          are created.

          This parameter is only valid when NumCacheNodes in  the  request  is
          greater  than  the  sum  of the number of active cache nodes and the
          number of cache nodes pending creation (which may be zero). The num-
          ber of Availability Zones supplied in this list must match the cache
          nodes being added in this request.

          Scenarios:

          o Scenario 1: You have 3 active nodes and wish to add 2 nodes. Spec-
            ify  NumCacheNodes=5 (3 + 2) and optionally specify two Availabil-
            ity Zones for the two new nodes.

          o Scenario 2: You have 3 active nodes and 2 nodes  pending  creation
            (from  the  scenario  1 call) and want to add 1 more node. Specify
            NumCacheNodes=6 ((3 + 2) + 1) and optionally specify an Availabil-
            ity Zone for the new node.

          o Scenario  3:  You  want  to cancel all pending operations. Specify
            NumCacheNodes=3 to cancel all pending operations.

          The Availability Zone placement of nodes pending creation cannot  be
          modified.  If  you  wish to cancel any nodes pending creation, add 0
          nodes by setting NumCacheNodes to the number of current nodes.

          If cross-az is specified, existing Memcached nodes remain  in  their
          current  Availability  Zone. Only newly created nodes can be located
          in different Availability Zones. For guidance on how to move  exist-
          ing  Memcached nodes to different Availability Zones, see the Avail-
          ability Zone Considerations section of Cache Node Considerations for
          Memcached .

              ing delete.

          o Scenario-3

            o Pending Action: Create

            o New Request: Delete

            o Result: The new delete, pending or immediate, replaces the pend-
              ing create.

          o Scenario-4

            o Pending Action: Create

            o New Request: Create

            o Result: The new create is added to the pending create.

            WARNING:
                Important: If the new create request is  Apply  Immediately  -
                Yes , all creates are performed immediately. If the new create
                request is Apply Immediately - No , all creates are pending.

          soon as possible, regardless of the PreferredMaintenanceWindow  set-
          ting for the cluster.

          If  false  ,  changes to the cluster are applied on the next mainte-
          nance reboot, or the next failure reboot, whichever occurs first.

          WARNING:
              If you perform a ModifyCacheCluster before a  pending  modifica-
              tion  is  applied,  the  pending modification is replaced by the
              newer modification.

              Important:  You  can  upgrade  to  a  newer  engine version (see
              Selecting a Cache Engine and Version ), but you cannot downgrade
              to  an earlier engine version. If you want to use an earlier en-
              gine version, you must delete the existing cluster and create it
              anew with the earlier engine version.

       --auto-minor-version-upgrade  |  --no-auto-minor-version-upgrade (bool-
       ean)

          upgrade campaign. This parameter is disabled for previous versions.

       --snapshot-retention-limit (integer)
          The number of days for which ElastiCache retains  automatic  cluster
          snapshots  before deleting them. For example, if you set SnapshotRe-
          tentionLimit to 5, a snapshot that was taken today is retained for 5
          days before being deleted.

          NOTE:
              If the value of SnapshotRetentionLimit is set to zero (0), back-
              ups are turned off.

       --snapshot-window (string)
          The daily time range (in UTC) during which ElastiCache begins taking
          a daily snapshot of your cluster.

            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
