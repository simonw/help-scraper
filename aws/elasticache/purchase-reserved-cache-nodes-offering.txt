NAME
       purchase-reserved-cache-nodes-offering -

DESCRIPTION
       Allows  you  to purchase a reserved cache node offering. Reserved nodes
       are not eligible for cancellation and are non-refundable. For more  in-
       formation, see Managing Costs with Reserved Nodes for Redis or Managing
       Costs with Reserved Nodes for Memcached.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            purchase-reserved-cache-nodes-offering
          --reserved-cache-nodes-offering-id <value>
          [--reserved-cache-node-id <value>]
          [--cache-node-count <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --reserved-cache-nodes-offering-id (string)
          The ID of the reserved cache node offering to purchase.

          Example: 438012d3-4052-4cc7-b2e3-8d3372e0e706

       --reserved-cache-node-id (string)
          A customer-specified identifier to track this reservation.

          NOTE:
              The Reserved Cache Node ID is an unique customer-specified iden-
              tifier to track this reservation. If this parameter is not spec-
              ified, ElastiCache automatically generates an identifier for the
              reservation.

          Example: myreservationID

       --cache-node-count (integer)
          The number of cache node instances to reserve.

          Default: 1

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  tags to be added to this resource. A tag is a key-value
          pair. A tag key must be accompanied by a tag value, although null is
          accepted.

          (structure)
              A tag that can be added to an ElastiCache cluster or replication
              group. Tags are composed of a Key/Value pair. You can  use  tags
              to categorize and track all your ElastiCache resources, with the
              exception of global replication group. When you  add  or  remove
              tags  on replication groups, those actions will be replicated to
              all nodes in the replication group. A tag with a null  Value  is
              permitted.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the tag. May not be null.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag's value. May be null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       ReservedCacheNode -> (structure)
          Represents the output of a PurchaseReservedCacheNodesOffering opera-
          tion.

          ReservedCacheNodeId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the reservation.

          ReservedCacheNodesOfferingId -> (string)
              The offering identifier.

          CacheNodeType -> (string)
              The cache node type for the reserved cache nodes.

              The following node types are supported by ElastiCache. Generally
              speaking, the current generation types provide more  memory  and
              computational power at lower cost when compared to their equiva-
              lent previous generation counterparts.
