DESCRIPTION
       Modifies the settings for a Global datastore.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-global-replication-group
          --global-replication-group-id <value>
          --apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately
          [--cache-node-type <value>]
          [--engine-version <value>]
          [--cache-parameter-group-name <value>]
          [--global-replication-group-description <value>]
          [--automatic-failover-enabled | --no-automatic-failover-enabled]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-replication-group-id (string)
          The name of the Global datastore

       --apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately (boolean)
          This  parameter  causes  the  modifications  in this request and any
          pending modifications to be applied, asynchronously and as  soon  as
          possible.  Modifications  to Global Replication Groups cannot be re-
          quested to be applied in PreferredMaintenceWindow.

       --cache-node-type (string)
          A valid cache node type that you want to scale this Global datastore
          to.

       --engine-version (string)
          The  upgraded  version of the cache engine to be run on the clusters
          in the Global datastore.

       --cache-parameter-group-name (string)
          The name of the cache parameter group to use with the Global  datas-
          tore.  It  must  be compatible with the major engine version used by
          the Global datastore.

       --global-replication-group-description (string)
          A description of the Global datastore

       --automatic-failover-enabled |  --no-automatic-failover-enabled  (bool-
       ean)
          Determines  whether  a  read  replica  is  automatically promoted to
          read/write primary if the existing primary encounters a failure.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To modify a global replication group

       The following modify-global-replication-group modifies  the  properties
       of  a  global  replication  group,  in  this  case  disabling automatic
       failover, using the Redis engine.

          aws elasticache modify-global-replication-group \
              --global-replication-group-id sgaui-pat-group \
              --apply-immediately \
              --no-automatic-failover-enabled

       Output

          {
              "GlobalReplicationGroup": {
                  "GlobalReplicationGroupId": "sgaui-test-group",
                  "GlobalReplicationGroupDescription": " ",

       Datastore in the Elasticache User Guide.

OUTPUT
       GlobalReplicationGroup -> (structure)
          Consists  of a primary cluster that accepts writes and an associated
          secondary cluster that resides in a  different  Amazon  region.  The
          secondary  cluster accepts only reads. The primary cluster automati-
          cally replicates updates to the secondary cluster.

          o The GlobalReplicationGroupIdSuffix  represents  the  name  of  the
            Global  datastore,  which is what you use to associate a secondary
            cluster.
