NAME
       failover-global-replication-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Used  to  failover  the  primary region to a secondary region. The sec-
       ondary region will become primary, and all other clusters  will  become
       secondary.

OPTIONS
       --global-replication-group-id (string)
          The name of the Global datastore

       --primary-region (string)
          The Amazon region of the primary cluster of the Global datastore

       --primary-replication-group-id (string)
          The name of the primary replication group

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       GlobalReplicationGroup -> (structure)
          Consists  of a primary cluster that accepts writes and an associated
          secondary cluster that resides in a  different  Amazon  region.  The
          secondary  cluster accepts only reads. The primary cluster automati-
          cally replicates updates to the secondary cluster.

          o The GlobalReplicationGroupIdSuffix  represents  the  name  of  the
            Global  datastore,  which is what you use to associate a secondary
            cluster.

              enabled.

          GlobalNodeGroups -> (list)
              Indicates  the slot configuration and global identifier for each
              slice group.

              (structure)

              A flag that enables in-transit encryption when set to true.
                 Required: Only available when creating a replication group in
                 an Amazon VPC using Redis OSS version 3.2.6 , 4.x or later.

          AtRestEncryptionEnabled -> (boolean)
              A flag that enables encryption at rest when set to true .

              You cannot modify the value of AtRestEncryptionEnabled after the
              replication group is created. To enable encryption at rest on  a
              replication  group  you must set AtRestEncryptionEnabled to true
              when you create the replication group.
                 Required: Only available when creating a replication group in
                 an Amazon VPC using Redis OSS version 3.2.6 , 4.x or later.
