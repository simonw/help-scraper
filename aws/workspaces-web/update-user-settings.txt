OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. Idempotency ensures that an API  request
          completes only once. With an idempotent request, if the original re-
          quest completes  successfully,  subsequent  retries  with  the  same
          client token return the result from the original successful request.

          If you do not specify a client token, one is automatically generated
          by the Amazon Web Services SDK.

       --cookie-synchronization-configuration (structure)
          The configuration that specifies which cookies  should  be  synchro-
          nized from the end user's local browser to the remote browser.

          null.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
