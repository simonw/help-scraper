CREATE-REPLICATION-JOB()                              CREATE-REPLICATION-JOB()



NAME
       create-replication-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  replication  job.  The  replication  job schedules periodic
       replication runs to replicate your server to Amazon Web Services.  Each
       replication run creates an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-replication-job
          --server-id <value>
          --seed-replication-time <value>
          [--frequency <value>]
          [--run-once | --no-run-once]
          [--license-type <value>]
          [--role-name <value>]
          [--description <value>]
          [--number-of-recent-amis-to-keep <value>]
          [--encrypted | --no-encrypted]
          [--kms-key-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --server-id (string)
          The ID of the server.

       --seed-replication-time (timestamp)
          The seed replication time.

       --frequency (integer)
          The time between consecutive replication runs, in hours.

       --run-once | --no-run-once (boolean)
          Indicates whether to run the replication job one time.

       --license-type (string)
          The  license  type  to  be  used for the AMI created by a successful
          replication run.

          Possible values:

          o AWS

          o BYOL

       --role-name (string)
          The name of the IAM role to be used by the Server Migration Service.

       --description (string)
          The description of the replication job.

       --number-of-recent-amis-to-keep (integer)
          The maximum number of SMS-created AMIs  to  retain.  The  oldest  is
          deleted  after  the  maximum number is reached and a new AMI is cre-
          ated.

       --encrypted | --no-encrypted (boolean)
          Indicates whether the replication job produces encrypted AMIs.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The ID of the KMS key for replication jobs  that  produce  encrypted
          AMIs. This value can be any of the following:

          o KMS key ID

          o KMS key alias

          o ARN referring to the KMS key ID

          o ARN referring to the KMS key alias

          If  encrypted  is  true  but a KMS key ID is not specified, the cus-
          tomer's default KMS key for Amazon EBS is used.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       replicationJobId -> (string)
          The unique identifier of the replication job.
