OPTIONS
       --replication-job-id (string)
          The ID of the replication job.

       --frequency (integer)
          The time between consecutive replication runs, in hours.

       --next-replication-run-start-time (timestamp)
          The start time of the next replication run.

       --license-type (string)
          The  license  type  to  be  used for the AMI created by a successful
          replication run.

          Possible values:

          o AWS

          o BYOL

       --role-name (string)
          The name of the IAM role to be used by Server Migration Service.

       --description (string)
          The description of the replication job.

       --number-of-recent-amis-to-keep (integer)
          The maximum number of SMS-created AMIs  to  retain.  The  oldest  is
          deleted  after  the  maximum number is reached and a new AMI is cre-
          ated.

       --encrypted | --no-encrypted (boolean)
          When true, the replication job produces encrypted AMIs. For more in-
          formation, KmsKeyId .

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the KMS key for replication jobs that produce encrypted
          AMIs. This value can be any of the following:

          o KMS key ID

          o KMS key alias

          o ARN referring to the KMS key ID

          o ARN referring to the KMS key alias

          If encrypted is enabled but a KMS key ID is not specified, the  cus-
          tomer's default KMS key for Amazon EBS is used.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
