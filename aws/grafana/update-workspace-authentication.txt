NAME
       update-workspace-authentication -

DESCRIPTION
       Use  this  operation  to  define  the identity provider (IdP) that this
       workspace authenticates users from, using SAML. You can also  map  SAML
       assertion  attributes  to  workspace  user information and define which
       groups in the assertion attribute are to  have  the  Admin  and  Editor
       roles in the workspace.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --authentication-providers (list)
          Specifies  whether this workspace uses SAML 2.0, Amazon Web Services
          Single Sign On, or both to authenticate users for using the  Grafana
          console within a workspace. For more information, see User authenti-
          cation in Amazon Managed Grafana .

          roleValues -> (structure)
              A  structure  containing arrays that map group names in the SAML
              assertion  to  the  Grafana  Admin  and  Editor  roles  in   the

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
