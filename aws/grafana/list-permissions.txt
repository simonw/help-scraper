LIST-PERMISSIONS()                                          LIST-PERMISSIONS()



NAME
       list-permissions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the users and groups who have the Grafana Admin and Editor roles
       in this workspace. If you use this operation without specifying  userId
       or  groupId  , the operation returns the roles of all users and groups.
       If you specify a userId or a groupId , only the roles for that user  or
       group  are returned. If you do this, you can specify only one userId or
       one groupId .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-permissions is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: permissions

SYNOPSIS
            list-permissions
          [--group-id <value>]
          [--user-id <value>]
          [--user-type <value>]
          --workspace-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --group-id (string)
          (Optional)  Limits  the  results to only the group that matches this
          ID.

       --user-id (string)
          (Optional) Limits the results to only the user that matches this ID.

       --user-type (string)
          (Optional) If you specify SSO_USER , then only  the  permissions  of
          Amazon Web Services SSO users are returned. If you specify SSO_GROUP
          , only the permissions of Amazon Web Services  SSO  groups  are  re-
          turned.

          Possible values:

          o SSO_USER

          o SSO_GROUP

       --workspace-id (string)
          The  ID  of the workspace to list permissions for. This parameter is
          required.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          The token to use in a subsequent ListPermissions operation to return
          the next set of results.

       permissions -> (list)
          The permissions returned by the operation.

          (structure)
              A structure containing the identity of one user or group and the
              Admin or Editor role that they have.

              role -> (string)
                 Specifies whether the user or group has the Admin  or  Editor
                 role.

              user -> (structure)
                 A structure with the ID of the user or group with this role.

                 id -> (string)
                     The ID of the user or group.

                     Pattern:
                     ^([0-9a-fA-F]{10}-|)[A-Fa-f0-9]{8}-[A-Fa-f0-9]{4}-[A-Fa-f0-9]{4}-[A-Fa-f0-9]{4}-[A-Fa-f0-9]{12}$

                 type -> (string)
                     Specifies whether this is a single user or a group.
