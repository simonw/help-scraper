DESCRIPTION
       Removes the Grafana Enterprise license from a workspace.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-license
          --license-type <value>
          --workspace-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --license-type (string)
          The type of license to remove from the workspace.

          Possible values:

          o ENTERPRISE

          o ENTERPRISE_FREE_TRIAL

       --workspace-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the  workspace to remove the Grafana Enterprise license
          from.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              If this is CUSTOMER_MANAGED , you manage those roles and permis-
              sions yourself. If you are creating this workspace in  a  member
              account  of  an organization and that account is not a delegated
              administrator account, and you want the workspace to access data
              sources  in  other Amazon Web Services accounts in the organiza-
              tion, you must choose CUSTOMER_MANAGED .
