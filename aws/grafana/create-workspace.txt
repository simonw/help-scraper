CREATE-WORKSPACE()                                          CREATE-WORKSPACE()



NAME
       create-workspace -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a workspace . In a workspace, you can create Grafana dashboards
       and visualizations to analyze your metrics, logs, and traces. You don't
       have  to  build,  package,  or  deploy  any hardware to run the Grafana
       server.

       Don't use CreateWorkspace to modify an existing workspace. Instead, use
       UpdateWorkspace .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --account-access-type (string)
          Specifies  whether  the workspace can access Amazon Web Services re-
          sources in this Amazon Web Services account only, or whether it  can
          also  access  Amazon Web Services resources in other accounts in the
          same organization. If you specify ORGANIZATION ,  you  must  specify
          which   organizational   units  the  workspace  can  access  in  the
          workspaceOrganizationalUnits parameter.

          Possible values:

          o CURRENT_ACCOUNT

          o ORGANIZATION

       --authentication-providers (list)
          Specifies whether this workspace uses SAML 2.0, Amazon Web  Services
          Single  Sign On, or both to authenticate users for using the Grafana
          console within a workspace. For more information, see User authenti-
          cation in Amazon Managed Grafana .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            AWS_SSO
            SAML

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive,  user-provided  identifier to ensure the
          idempotency of the request.

       --organization-role-name (string)
          The name of an IAM role that already exists to  use  with  Organiza-
          tions  to  access  Amazon Web Services data sources and notification
          channels in other accounts in an organization.

       --permission-type (string)
          If you specify SERVICE_MANAGED on AWS Grafana console,  Amazon  Man-
          aged  Grafana automatically creates the IAM roles and provisions the
          permissions that the workspace needs to use Amazon Web Services data
          sources  and  notification channels. In CLI mode, the permissionType
          SERVICE_MANAGED will not create the IAM role for you.

          If you specify CUSTOMER_MANAGED , you will manage  those  roles  and
          permissions yourself. If you are creating this workspace in a member
          account of an organization that is not a delegated administrator ac-
          count,  and  you  want the workspace to access data sources in other
          Amazon Web Services accounts in the organization,  you  must  choose
          CUSTOMER_MANAGED .

          For  more  information,  see  Amazon Managed Grafana permissions and
          policies for Amazon Web Services data sources and notification chan-
          nels .

          Possible values:

          o CUSTOMER_MANAGED

          o SERVICE_MANAGED

       --stack-set-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  CloudFormation  stack set to use to generate IAM
          roles to be used for this workspace.

       --tags (map)
          The list of tags associated with the workspace.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --workspace-data-sources (list)
          Specify the Amazon Web Services data sources that  you  want  to  be
          queried  in  this  workspace. Specifying these data sources here en-
          ables Amazon Managed Grafana to create  IAM  roles  and  permissions
          that  allow  Amazon Managed Grafana to read data from these sources.
          You must still add them as data sources in the  Grafana  console  in
          the workspace.

          If  you  don't specify a data source here, you can still add it as a
          data source in the workspace console later. However, you  will  then
          have to manually configure permissions for it.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            AMAZON_OPENSEARCH_SERVICE
            CLOUDWATCH
            PROMETHEUS
            XRAY
            TIMESTREAM
            SITEWISE
            ATHENA
            REDSHIFT

       --workspace-description (string)
          A description for the workspace. This is used only to help you iden-
          tify this workspace.

          Pattern: ^[\\p{L}\\p{Z}\\p{N}\\p{P}]{0,2048}$

       --workspace-name (string)
          The name for the workspace. It does not have to be unique.

       --workspace-notification-destinations (list)
          Specify the Amazon Web Services notification channels that you  plan
          to use in this workspace. Specifying these data sources here enables
          Amazon Managed Grafana to create IAM roles and permissions that  al-
          low Amazon Managed Grafana to use these channels.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --workspace-organizational-units (list)
          Specifies the organizational units that this workspace is allowed to
          use data sources from, if this workspace is in an  account  that  is
          part of an organization.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --workspace-role-arn (string)
          The  workspace needs an IAM role that grants permissions to the Ama-
          zon Web Services resources that the workspace will view  data  from.
          If  you  already  have a role that you want to use, specify it here.
          The permission type should be set to CUSTOMER_MANAGED .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
