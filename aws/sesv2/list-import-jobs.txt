       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-import-jobs
          [--import-destination-type <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --import-destination-type (string)
          The  destination of the import job, which can be used to list import
          jobs that have a certain ImportDestinationType .

          Possible values:

          o SUPPRESSION_LIST

          o CONTACT_LIST

       --next-token (string)
          A string token indicating that there might be additional import jobs
          available  to  be  listed.  Copy  this token to a subsequent call to
          ListImportJobs with the same parameters to retrieve the next page of
          import jobs.

       --page-size (integer)
          Maximum  number of import jobs to return at once. Use this parameter
          to paginate results. If additional  import  jobs  exist  beyond  the
          specified  limit, the NextToken element is sent in the response. Use
          the NextToken value in subsequent requests  to  retrieve  additional
          addresses.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
