DESCRIPTION
       List  all  of the dedicated IP pools that exist in your Amazon Web Ser-
       vices account in the current Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-dedicated-ip-pools
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          A token returned from a previous call to ListDedicatedIpPools to in-
          dicate the position in the list of dedicated IP pools.

       --page-size (integer)
          The  number  of results to show in a single call to ListDedicatedIp-
          Pools . If the number of results is larger than the number you spec-
          ified in this parameter, then the response includes a NextToken ele-
          ment, which you can use to obtain additional results.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DedicatedIpPools -> (list)
          A  list  of  all  of the dedicated IP pools that are associated with
          your Amazon Web Services account in the current Region.

          (string)
              The name of a dedicated IP pool.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates that there are additional IP pools  to  list.
          To  view additional IP pools, issue another request to ListDedicate-
          dIpPools , passing this token in the NextToken parameter.
