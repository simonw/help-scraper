SEND-EMAIL()                                                      SEND-EMAIL()



NAME
       send-email -

DESCRIPTION
       Sends  an  email message. You can use the Amazon SES API v2 to send the
       following types of messages:

       o Simple  A standard email message. When you create this type  of  mes-
         sage,  you  specify  the sender, the recipient, and the message body,
         and Amazon SES assembles the message for you.

       o Raw  A raw, MIME-formatted email message. When you send this type  of
         email, you have to specify all of the message headers, as well as the
         message body. You can use this message type  to  send  messages  that
         contain  attachments.  The message that you specify has to be a valid
         MIME message.

       o Templated  A message that contains  personalization  tags.  When  you
         send this type of email, Amazon SES API v2 automatically replaces the
         tags with values that you specify.

OPTIONS
       --from-email-address (string)
          The email address to use as the "From" address for  the  email.  The
          address that you specify has to be verified.

       --from-email-address-identity-arn (string)
          This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN
          of the identity that is associated with  the  sending  authorization
          policy  that  permits  you to use the email address specified in the
          FromEmailAddress parameter.

          For  example,  if  the  owner  of   example.com   (which   has   ARN
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com)  attaches a
          policy to it that authorizes you to use sender@example.com, then you
          would     specify     the    FromEmailAddressIdentityArn    to    be
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com,   and   the
          FromEmailAddress to be sender@example.com.

          For more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES
          Developer Guide .

          For Raw emails, the FromEmailAddressIdentityArn value overrides  the
          X-SES-SOURCE-ARN  and  X-SES-FROM-ARN headers specified in raw email
          message content.

       --destination (structure)
          An object that contains the recipients of the email message.

          ToAddresses -> (list)
              An array that contains the email addresses of the  "To"  recipi-
              ents for the email.

              (string)

          CcAddresses -> (list)
              An  array  that contains the email addresses of the "CC" (carbon
              copy) recipients for the email.

              (string)

          BccAddresses -> (list)
              An array that contains the email addresses of the  "BCC"  (blind
              carbon copy) recipients for the email.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ToAddresses=string,string,CcAddresses=string,string,BccAddresses=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ToAddresses": ["string", ...],
            "CcAddresses": ["string", ...],
            "BccAddresses": ["string", ...]
          }

       --reply-to-addresses (list)
          The  "Reply-to"  email addresses for the message. When the recipient
          replies to the message, each Reply-to address receives the reply.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --feedback-forwarding-email-address (string)
          The address that you want bounce and complaint notifications  to  be
          sent to.

       --feedback-forwarding-email-address-identity-arn (string)
          This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN
          of the identity that is associated with  the  sending  authorization
          policy  that  permits  you to use the email address specified in the
          FeedbackForwardingEmailAddress parameter.

          For  example,  if  the  owner  of   example.com   (which   has   ARN
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com)  attaches a
          policy to it that authorizes you to use  feedback@example.com,  then
          you  would  specify the FeedbackForwardingEmailAddressIdentityArn to
          be arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com, and  the
          FeedbackForwardingEmailAddress to be feedback@example.com.

          For more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES
          Developer Guide .

       --content (structure)
          An object that contains the body of the message. You can send either
          a Simple message Raw message or a template Message.

          Simple -> (structure)
              The  simple email message. The message consists of a subject and
              a message body.

              Subject -> (structure)
                 The subject line of the email. The subject line can only con-
                 tain   7-bit  ASCII  characters.  However,  you  can  specify
                 non-ASCII  characters  in  the  subject  line  by  using  en-
                 coded-word syntax, as described in RFC 2047 .

                 Data -> (string)
                     The content of the message itself.

                 Charset -> (string)
                     The  character  set  for the content. Because of the con-
                     straints of the SMTP  protocol,  Amazon  SES  uses  7-bit
                     ASCII by default. If the text includes characters outside
                     of the ASCII range, you have to specify a character  set.
                     For  example,  you  could specify UTF-8 , ISO-8859-1 , or
                     Shift_JIS .

              Body -> (structure)
                 The body of the message. You can specify an HTML  version  of
                 the message, a text-only version of the message, or both.

                 Text -> (structure)
                     An object that represents the version of the message that
                     is displayed in email clients that don't support HTML, or
                     clients where the recipient has disabled HTML rendering.

                     Data -> (string)
                        The content of the message itself.

                     Charset -> (string)
                        The character set for the content. Because of the con-
                        straints of the SMTP protocol, Amazon SES  uses  7-bit
                        ASCII by default. If the text includes characters out-
                        side of the ASCII range, you have to specify a charac-
                        ter  set.  For  example,  you  could  specify  UTF-8 ,
                        ISO-8859-1 , or Shift_JIS .

                 Html -> (structure)
                     An object that represents the version of the message that
                     is  displayed  in  email  clients that support HTML. HTML
                     messages can include formatted text, hyperlinks,  images,
                     and more.

                     Data -> (string)
                        The content of the message itself.

                     Charset -> (string)
                        The character set for the content. Because of the con-
                        straints of the SMTP protocol, Amazon SES  uses  7-bit
                        ASCII by default. If the text includes characters out-
                        side of the ASCII range, you have to specify a charac-
                        ter  set.  For  example,  you  could  specify  UTF-8 ,
                        ISO-8859-1 , or Shift_JIS .

          Raw -> (structure)
              The raw email message. The message has  to  meet  the  following
              criteria:

              o The  message  has to contain a header and a body, separated by
                one blank line.

              o All of the required header fields must be present in the  mes-
                sage.

              o Each  part of a multipart MIME message must be formatted prop-
                erly.

              o If you include attachments, they must be in a file format that
                the Amazon SES API v2 supports.

              o The raw data of the message needs to base64-encoded if you are
                accessing Amazon SES directly through the HTTPS interface.  If
                you are accessing Amazon SES using an Amazon Web Services SDK,
                the SDK takes care of the base 64-encoding for you.

              o If any of the MIME parts in your message contain content  that
                is  outside of the 7-bit ASCII character range, you should en-
                code that content to ensure  that  recipients'  email  clients
                render the message properly.

              o The length of any single line of text in the message can't ex-
                ceed 1,000 characters. This restriction is defined in RFC 5321
                .

              Data -> (blob)
                 The  raw email message. The message has to meet the following
                 criteria:

                 o The message has to contain a header and a  body,  separated
                   by one blank line.

                 o All  of  the  required header fields must be present in the
                   message.

                 o Each part of a multipart MIME  message  must  be  formatted
                   properly.

                 o Attachments  must  be  in a file format that the Amazon SES
                   supports.

                 o The raw data of the message needs to base64-encoded if  you
                   are  accessing Amazon SES directly through the HTTPS inter-
                   face. If you are accessing Amazon SES using an  Amazon  Web
                   Services  SDK,  the  SDK takes care of the base 64-encoding
                   for you.

                 o If any of the MIME parts in your  message  contain  content
                   that  is  outside  of  the 7-bit ASCII character range, you
                   should encode that content to ensure that recipients' email
                   clients render the message properly.

                 o The  length of any single line of text in the message can't
                   exceed 1,000 characters. This restriction is defined in RFC
                   5321 .

          Template -> (structure)
              The template to use for the email message.

              TemplateName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the template. You will refer to this name when
                 you send email using the SendTemplatedEmail  or  SendBulkTem-
                 platedEmail operations.

              TemplateArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the template.

              TemplateData -> (string)
                 An  object  that  defines the values to use for message vari-
                 ables in the template. This object  is  a  set  of  key-value
                 pairs.  Each  key defines a message variable in the template.
                 The corresponding value defines the value  to  use  for  that
                 variable.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       MessageId -> (string)
          A  unique identifier for the message that is generated when the mes-
          sage is accepted.

          NOTE:
              It's possible for Amazon SES to accept a message without sending
