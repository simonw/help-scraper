NAME
       list-email-identities -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of all of the email identities that are associated with
       your Amazon Web Services account. An identity can be  either  an  email
       address  or  a domain. This operation returns identities that are veri-
       fied as well as those that aren't. This  operation  returns  identities
       that are associated with Amazon SES and Amazon Pinpoint.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-email-identities
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          A  token returned from a previous call to ListEmailIdentities to in-
          dicate the position in the list of identities.

       --page-size (integer)
          The number of results to show in a single call  to  ListEmailIdenti-
          ties . If the number of results is larger than the number you speci-
          fied in this parameter, then the response includes a NextToken  ele-
          ment, which you can use to obtain additional results.

          The  value you specify has to be at least 0, and can be no more than
          1000.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EmailIdentities -> (list)
          An array that includes all of the email identities  associated  with
          your Amazon Web Services account.

          (structure)
              Information about an email identity.

              IdentityType -> (string)
                 The email identity type. Note: the MANAGED_DOMAIN type is not
                 supported for email identity types.

              IdentityName -> (string)
                 The address or domain of the identity.

              SendingEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether or not you can send email  from  the  iden-
                 tity.

                 An identity is an email address or domain that you send email
                 from. Before you can send email from an identity, you have to
                 demostrate  that you own the identity, and that you authorize
                 Amazon SES to send email from that identity.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates that there are additional configuration  sets
          to  list.  To  view additional configuration sets, issue another re-
          quest to ListEmailIdentities , and pass this token in the  NextToken
          parameter.
