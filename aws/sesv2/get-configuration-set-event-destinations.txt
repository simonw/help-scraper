NAME
       get-configuration-set-event-destinations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve  a  list of event destinations that are associated with a con-
       figuration set.
          Events include message sends, deliveries,  opens,  clicks,  bounces,
          and  complaints. Event destinations are places that you can send in-
          formation about these events to. For example,  you  can  send  event
          data to Amazon SNS to receive notifications when you receive bounces
          or complaints, or you can use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to stream
          data to Amazon S3 for long-term storage.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-configuration-set-event-destinations
          --configuration-set-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --configuration-set-name (string)
          The  name  of the configuration set that contains the event destina-
          tion.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EventDestinations -> (list)
          An array that includes all of the events destinations that have been
          configured for the configuration set.

          (structure)
              In the Amazon SES API v2, events include message sends, deliver-
              ies,  opens,  clicks,  bounces,  complaints and delivery delays.
              Event destinations are places  that  you  can  send  information
              about  these  events to. For example, you can send event data to
              Amazon SNS to receive notifications when you receive bounces  or
              complaints,  or  you  can  use  Amazon  Kinesis Data Firehose to
              stream data to Amazon S3 for long-term storage.

              Name -> (string)
                 A name that identifies the event destination.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 If true , the event destination is enabled.  When  the  event
                 destination is enabled, the specified event types are sent to
                 the destinations in this EventDestinationDefinition .

                 If false , the event destination is disabled. When the  event
                 destination  is disabled, events aren't sent to the specified
                 destinations.

              MatchingEventTypes -> (list)
                 The types of events that Amazon SES sends  to  the  specified
                 event destinations.

                 (string)
                     An  email  sending  event type. For example, email sends,
                     opens, and bounces are all email events.
