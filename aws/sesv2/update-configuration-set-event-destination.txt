UPDATE-CONFIGURATION-SET-EVENT-DESUPDATE-CONFIGURATION-SET-EVENT-DESTINATION()



NAME
       update-configuration-set-event-destination -

DESCRIPTION
       Update  the  configuration  of an event destination for a configuration
       set.
          Events include message sends, deliveries,  opens,  clicks,  bounces,
          and  complaints. Event destinations are places that you can send in-
          formation about these events to. For example,  you  can  send  event
          data to Amazon SNS to receive notifications when you receive bounces
          or complaints, or you can use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to stream
          data to Amazon S3 for long-term storage.

          --event-destination-name <value>
          --event-destination <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --configuration-set-name (string)
          The  name  of the configuration set that contains the event destina-
          tion to modify.

          An object that defines the event destination.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              If true , the event destination is enabled. When the event  des-
              tination  is  enabled, the specified event types are sent to the
              destinations in this EventDestinationDefinition .

              If false , the event destination is  disabled.  When  the  event
              destination  is  disabled,  events  aren't sent to the specified
              destinations.

                     when you send email events to Amazon CloudWatch.

                     DimensionName -> (string)
                        The name of an Amazon CloudWatch dimension  associated
                        with an email sending metric. The name has to meet the

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
