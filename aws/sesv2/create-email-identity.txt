CREATE-EMAIL-IDENTITY()                                CREATE-EMAIL-IDENTITY()



NAME
       create-email-identity -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  the  process  of verifying an email identity. An identity is an
       email address or domain that you use when you send  email.  Before  you
       can use an identity to send email, you first have to verify it. By ver-
       ifying an identity, you demonstrate that you're the owner of the  iden-
       tity,  and that you've given Amazon SES API v2 permission to send email
       from the identity.

       When you verify an email address, Amazon SES sends an email to the  ad-
       dress. Your email address is verified as soon as you follow the link in
       the verification email.

       When you verify a domain without specifying  the  DkimSigningAttributes
       object,  this  operation provides a set of DKIM tokens. You can convert
       these tokens into CNAME records, which you then add to the DNS configu-
       ration for your domain. Your domain is verified when Amazon SES detects
       these records in the DNS configuration for your domain. This  verifica-
       tion method is known as Easy DKIM .

       Alternatively,  you  can  perform the verification process by providing
       your own public-private key pair. This verification method is known  as
       Bring  Your  Own  DKIM (BYODKIM). To use BYODKIM, your call to the Cre-
       ateEmailIdentity operation has to include the DkimSigningAttributes ob-
       ject. When you specify this object, you provide a selector (a component
       of the DNS record name that identifies the public key to use  for  DKIM
       authentication) and a private key.

       When you verify a domain, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens,
       which you can convert into CNAME tokens. You add these CNAME tokens  to
       the  DNS  configuration  for  your domain. Your domain is verified when
       Amazon SES detects these records in the DNS configuration for your  do-
       main.  For some DNS providers, it can take 72 hours or more to complete
       the domain verification process.

       Additionally, you can associate an existing configuration set with  the
       email identity that you're verifying.

OPTIONS
       --email-identity (string)
          The email address or domain to verify.

       --tags (list)
          An  array of objects that define the tags (keys and values) to asso-
          ciate with the email identity.

          (structure)
              An object that defines the tags that are associated with  a  re-
              source.  A  tag  is a label that you optionally define and asso-
              ciate with a resource. Tags can help you categorize  and  manage
              resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environ-
              ment, or other criteria. A resource can have as many as 50 tags.

              Each tag consists of a required tag key and  an  associated  tag
              value  ,  both of which you define. A tag key is a general label
              that acts as a category for a more specific  tag  value.  A  tag
              value  acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can con-
              tain as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as  many
              as  256  characters. The characters can be Unicode letters, dig-
              its, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : /  =  +
              -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:

              o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

              o For  each associated resource, each tag key must be unique and
                it can have only one value.

              o The aws: prefix is reserved for use by  Amazon  Web  Services;
                you  cant use it in any tag keys or values that you define. In
                addition, you can't edit or remove tag keys or values that use
                this  prefix. Tags that use this prefix dont count against the
                limit of 50 tags per resource.

              o You can associate tags with public or  shared  resources,  but
                the  tags  are available only for your Amazon Web Services ac-
                count, not any other accounts that share the resource. In  ad-
                dition, the tags are available only for resources that are lo-
                cated in the specified Amazon Web  Services  Region  for  your
                Amazon Web Services account.

              Key -> (string)
                 One  part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum
                 length of a tag key is 128 characters. The minimum length  is
                 1 character.

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The
                 maximum length of a tag value is 256 characters. The  minimum
                 length  is 0 characters. If you don't want a resource to have
                 a specific tag value, don't specify a value for this  parame-
                 ter.  If you don't specify a value, Amazon SES sets the value
                 to an empty string.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --dkim-signing-attributes (structure)
          If your request includes this  object,  Amazon  SES  configures  the
          identity  to  use Bring Your Own DKIM (BYODKIM) for DKIM authentica-
          tion purposes, or, configures the key length to  be  used  for  Easy
          DKIM .

          You  can only specify this object if the email identity is a domain,
          as opposed to an address.

          DomainSigningSelector -> (string)
              [Bring Your Own DKIM] A string that's used to identify a  public
              key in the DNS configuration for a domain.

          DomainSigningPrivateKey -> (string)
              [Bring  Your  Own  DKIM] A private key that's used to generate a
              DKIM signature.

              The private key must use 1024 or 2048-bit  RSA  encryption,  and
              must be encoded using base64 encoding.

          NextSigningKeyLength -> (string)
              [Easy  DKIM]  The  key  length of the future DKIM key pair to be
              generated. This can be changed at most once per day.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DomainSigningSelector=string,DomainSigningPrivateKey=string,NextSigningKeyLength=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DomainSigningSelector": "string",
            "DomainSigningPrivateKey": "string",
            "NextSigningKeyLength": "RSA_1024_BIT"|"RSA_2048_BIT"
          }

       --configuration-set-name (string)
          The configuration set to use by default when sending from this iden-
          tity.  Note  that any configuration set defined in the email sending
          request takes precedence.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       IdentityType -> (string)
          The  email  identity type. Note: the MANAGED_DOMAIN identity type is
          not supported.

       VerifiedForSendingStatus -> (boolean)
          Specifies whether or not the identity is verified. You can only send
          email from verified email addresses or domains. For more information
          about verifying identities, see the Amazon Pinpoint User Guide .

       DkimAttributes -> (structure)
          An object that contains information about the  DKIM  attributes  for
          the identity.

          SigningEnabled -> (boolean)
              If  the value is true , then the messages that you send from the
              identity are signed using DKIM. If the value is false , then the
              messages that you send from the identity aren't DKIM-signed.

          Status -> (string)
              Describes whether or not Amazon SES has successfully located the
              DKIM records in the DNS records for the domain. The  status  can
              be one of the following:

              o PENDING   The  verification  process was initiated, but Amazon
                SES hasn't yet detected the DKIM records in the DNS configura-
                tion for the domain.

              o SUCCESS  The verification process completed successfully.

              o FAILED  The verification process failed. This typically occurs
                when Amazon SES fails to find the DKIM records in the DNS con-
                figuration of the domain.

              o TEMPORARY_FAILURE   A temporary issue is preventing Amazon SES
                from determining the DKIM authentication status of the domain.

              o NOT_STARTED  The DKIM verification process hasn't been  initi-
                ated for the domain.

          Tokens -> (list)
              If  you  used Easy DKIM to configure DKIM authentication for the
              domain, then this object contains a set of unique  strings  that
              you use to create a set of CNAME records that you add to the DNS
              configuration for your domain. When  Amazon  SES  detects  these
              records  in  the DNS configuration for your domain, the DKIM au-
              thentication process is complete.

              If you configured DKIM authentication for the domain by  provid-
              ing  your own public-private key pair, then this object contains
              the selector for the public key.

              Regardless of the DKIM authentication method you use, Amazon SES
              searches for the appropriate records in the DNS configuration of
              the domain for up to 72 hours.

              (string)

          SigningAttributesOrigin -> (string)
              A string that indicates how DKIM was configured  for  the  iden-
              tity. These are the possible values:

              o AWS_SES   Indicates  that DKIM was configured for the identity
                by using Easy DKIM .

              o EXTERNAL  Indicates that DKIM was configured for the  identity
                by using Bring Your Own DKIM (BYODKIM).

          NextSigningKeyLength -> (string)
              [Easy  DKIM]  The  key  length of the future DKIM key pair to be
              generated. This can be changed at most once per day.

          CurrentSigningKeyLength -> (string)
              [Easy DKIM] The key length of the DKIM key pair in use.

          LastKeyGenerationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              [Easy DKIM] The last time a key  pair  was  generated  for  this
              identity.
