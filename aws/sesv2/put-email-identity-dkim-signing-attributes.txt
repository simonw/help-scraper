       o Update  the  signing  attributes for an identity that uses Bring Your
         Own DKIM (BYODKIM).

       o Update the key length that should be used for Easy DKIM.

       o Change from using no DKIM authentication to using Easy DKIM.

       o Change from using no DKIM authentication to using BYODKIM.

       o Change from using Easy DKIM to using BYODKIM.

       o Change from using BYODKIM to using Easy DKIM.

SYNOPSIS
            put-email-identity-dkim-signing-attributes
          --email-identity <value>
          --signing-attributes-origin <value>
          [--signing-attributes <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --email-identity (string)
          The email identity.

       --signing-attributes-origin (string)
          The method to use to configure DKIM for the identity. There are  the
          following possible values:

          o AWS_SES  Configure DKIM for the identity by using Easy DKIM .

          o EXTERNAL   Configure DKIM for the identity by using Bring Your Own
            DKIM (BYODKIM).

          Possible values:

          o AWS_SES

          o EXTERNAL

       --signing-attributes (structure)
          An object that contains information about the private key and selec-
          tor  that  you  want  to  use to configure DKIM for the identity for
          Bring Your Own DKIM (BYODKIM) for the identity, or,  configures  the
          key length to be used for Easy DKIM .

          DomainSigningSelector -> (string)
              [Bring  Your Own DKIM] A string that's used to identify a public
              key in the DNS configuration for a domain.

          DomainSigningPrivateKey -> (string)
              [Bring Your Own DKIM] A private key that's used  to  generate  a
              DKIM signature.

              The  private  key  must use 1024 or 2048-bit RSA encryption, and
              must be encoded using base64 encoding.

          NextSigningKeyLength -> (string)
              [Easy DKIM] The key length of the future DKIM  key  pair  to  be
              generated. This can be changed at most once per day.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DomainSigningSelector=string,DomainSigningPrivateKey=string,NextSigningKeyLength=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DomainSigningSelector": "string",
            "DomainSigningPrivateKey": "string",
            "NextSigningKeyLength": "RSA_1024_BIT"|"RSA_2048_BIT"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DkimStatus -> (string)
          The DKIM authentication status of the identity.  Amazon  SES  deter-
          mines the authentication status by searching for specific records in
          the DNS configuration for your domain. If you used Easy DKIM to  set
          up  DKIM authentication, Amazon SES tries to find three unique CNAME
          records in the DNS configuration for your domain.

          If you provided a public key to perform DKIM authentication,  Amazon
          SES tries to find a TXT record that uses the selector that you spec-
          ified. The value of the TXT record  must  be  a  public  key  that's
          paired  with  the  private  key that you specified in the process of
          creating the identity.

          The status can be one of the following:

          o PENDING  The verification process was initiated,  but  Amazon  SES
            hasn't  yet detected the DKIM records in the DNS configuration for
            the domain.

          o SUCCESS  The verification process completed successfully.

          o FAILED  The verification process  failed.  This  typically  occurs
            when Amazon SES fails to find the DKIM records in the DNS configu-
            ration of the domain.

          o TEMPORARY_FAILURE  A temporary issue is preventing Amazon SES from
            determining the DKIM authentication status of the domain.

          o NOT_STARTED   The  DKIM verification process hasn't been initiated
            for the domain.

       DkimTokens -> (list)
          If you used Easy DKIM to configure DKIM authentication for  the  do-
          main, then this object contains a set of unique strings that you use
          to create a set of CNAME records that you add to the DNS  configura-
          tion  for  your domain. When Amazon SES detects these records in the
          DNS configuration for your domain, the DKIM  authentication  process
          is complete.

          If  you  configured  DKIM authentication for the domain by providing
          your own public-private key pair, then this object contains the  se-
          lector that's associated with your public key.

          Regardless  of  the  DKIM  authentication method you use, Amazon SES
          searches for the appropriate records in the DNS configuration of the
          domain for up to 72 hours.
