GET-EMAIL-IDENTITY()                                      GET-EMAIL-IDENTITY()



NAME
       get-email-identity -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  information  about  a  specific identity, including the iden-
       tity's verification status, sending authorization  policies,  its  DKIM
       authentication status, and its custom Mail-From settings.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-email-identity
          --email-identity <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --email-identity (string)
          The email identity.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       IdentityType -> (string)
          The  email  identity type. Note: the MANAGED_DOMAIN identity type is
          not supported.

       FeedbackForwardingStatus -> (boolean)
          The feedback forwarding configuration for the identity.

          If the value is true , you receive email notifications  when  bounce
          or  complaint  events occur. These notifications are sent to the ad-
          dress that you specified in the Return-Path header of  the  original
          email.

          You're required to have a method of tracking bounces and complaints.
          If you haven't set up another mechanism for receiving bounce or com-
          plaint  notifications  (for example, by setting up an event destina-
          tion), you receive an email notification  when  these  events  occur
          (even if this setting is disabled).

       VerifiedForSendingStatus -> (boolean)
          Specifies whether or not the identity is verified. You can only send
          email from verified email addresses or domains. For more information
          about verifying identities, see the Amazon Pinpoint User Guide .

       DkimAttributes -> (structure)
          An  object  that  contains information about the DKIM attributes for
          the identity.

          SigningEnabled -> (boolean)
              If the value is true , then the messages that you send from  the
              identity are signed using DKIM. If the value is false , then the
              messages that you send from the identity aren't DKIM-signed.

          Status -> (string)
              Describes whether or not Amazon SES has successfully located the
              DKIM  records  in the DNS records for the domain. The status can
              be one of the following:

              o PENDING  The verification process was  initiated,  but  Amazon
                SES hasn't yet detected the DKIM records in the DNS configura-
                tion for the domain.

              o SUCCESS  The verification process completed successfully.

              o FAILED  The verification process failed. This typically occurs
                when Amazon SES fails to find the DKIM records in the DNS con-
                figuration of the domain.

              o TEMPORARY_FAILURE  A temporary issue is preventing Amazon  SES
                from determining the DKIM authentication status of the domain.

              o NOT_STARTED   The DKIM verification process hasn't been initi-
                ated for the domain.

          Tokens -> (list)
              If you used Easy DKIM to configure DKIM authentication  for  the
              domain,  then  this object contains a set of unique strings that
              you use to create a set of CNAME records that you add to the DNS
              configuration  for  your  domain.  When Amazon SES detects these
              records in the DNS configuration for your domain, the  DKIM  au-
              thentication process is complete.

              If  you configured DKIM authentication for the domain by provid-
              ing your own public-private key pair, then this object  contains
              the selector for the public key.

              Regardless of the DKIM authentication method you use, Amazon SES
              searches for the appropriate records in the DNS configuration of
              the domain for up to 72 hours.

              (string)

          SigningAttributesOrigin -> (string)
              A  string  that  indicates how DKIM was configured for the iden-
              tity. These are the possible values:

              o AWS_SES  Indicates that DKIM was configured for  the  identity
                by using Easy DKIM .

              o EXTERNAL   Indicates that DKIM was configured for the identity
                by using Bring Your Own DKIM (BYODKIM).

          NextSigningKeyLength -> (string)
              [Easy DKIM] The key length of the future DKIM  key  pair  to  be
              generated. This can be changed at most once per day.

          CurrentSigningKeyLength -> (string)
              [Easy DKIM] The key length of the DKIM key pair in use.

          LastKeyGenerationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              [Easy  DKIM]  The  last  time  a key pair was generated for this
              identity.

       MailFromAttributes -> (structure)
          An object that contains information about the  Mail-From  attributes
          for the email identity.

          MailFromDomain -> (string)
              The  name  of  a  domain that an email identity uses as a custom
              MAIL FROM domain.

          MailFromDomainStatus -> (string)
              The status of the MAIL FROM domain. This  status  can  have  the
              following values:

              o PENDING  Amazon SES hasn't started searching for the MX record
                yet.

              o SUCCESS  Amazon SES detected the required MX  record  for  the
                MAIL FROM domain.

              o FAILED   Amazon  SES can't find the required MX record, or the
                record no longer exists.

              o TEMPORARY_FAILURE  A temporary issue occurred, which prevented
                Amazon  SES  from  determining the status of the MAIL FROM do-
                main.

          BehaviorOnMxFailure -> (string)
              The action to take if the required MX record can't be found when
              you  send an email. When you set this value to UseDefaultValue ,
              the mail is sent using amazonses.com as the  MAIL  FROM  domain.
              When you set this value to RejectMessage , the Amazon SES API v2
              returns a MailFromDomainNotVerified error, and  doesn't  attempt
              to deliver the email.

              These  behaviors are taken when the custom MAIL FROM domain con-
              figuration is in the Pending ,  Failed  ,  and  TemporaryFailure
              states.

       Policies -> (map)
          A map of policy names to policies.

          key -> (string)
              The name of the policy.

              The policy name cannot exceed 64 characters and can only include
              alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores.

          value -> (string)
              The text of the policy in JSON format. The policy cannot  exceed
              4 KB.

              For  information about the syntax of sending authorization poli-
              cies, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

       Tags -> (list)
          An array of objects that define the tags (keys and values) that  are
          associated with the email identity.

          (structure)
              An  object  that defines the tags that are associated with a re-
              source. A tag is a label that you optionally  define  and  asso-
              ciate  with  a resource. Tags can help you categorize and manage
              resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environ-
              ment, or other criteria. A resource can have as many as 50 tags.

              Each  tag  consists  of a required tag key and an associated tag
              value , both of which you define. A tag key is a  general  label
              that  acts  as  a  category for a more specific tag value. A tag
              value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can  con-
              tain  as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many
              as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode  letters,  dig-
              its,  white  space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = +
              -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:

              o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

              o For each associated resource, each tag key must be unique  and
                it can have only one value.

              o The  aws:  prefix  is reserved for use by Amazon Web Services;
                you cant use it in any tag keys or values that you define.  In
                addition, you can't edit or remove tag keys or values that use
                this prefix. Tags that use this prefix dont count against  the
                limit of 50 tags per resource.

              o You  can  associate  tags with public or shared resources, but
                the tags are available only for your Amazon Web  Services  ac-
                count,  not any other accounts that share the resource. In ad-
                dition, the tags are available only for resources that are lo-
                cated  in  the  specified  Amazon Web Services Region for your
                Amazon Web Services account.

              Key -> (string)
                 One part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The  maximum
                 length  of a tag key is 128 characters. The minimum length is
                 1 character.

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The
                 maximum  length of a tag value is 256 characters. The minimum
                 length is 0 characters. If you don't want a resource to  have
                 a  specific tag value, don't specify a value for this parame-
                 ter. If you don't specify a value, Amazon SES sets the  value
                 to an empty string.

       ConfigurationSetName -> (string)
          The  configuration  set used by default when sending from this iden-
          tity.
