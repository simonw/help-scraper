CREATE-CONFIGURATION-SET-EVENT-DESCREATE-CONFIGURATION-SET-EVENT-DESTINATION()



NAME
       create-configuration-set-event-destination -

DESCRIPTION
       Create  an event destination. Events include message sends, deliveries,
       opens, clicks, bounces, and complaints. Event destinations  are  places
       that  you  can send information about these events to. For example, you
       can send event data to Amazon SNS to receive notifications when you re-
       ceive  bounces  or complaints, or you can use Amazon Kinesis Data Fire-
       hose to stream data to Amazon S3 for long-term storage.

       A single configuration set can include more than one event destination.

              tination is enabled, the specified event types are sent  to  the
              destinations in this EventDestinationDefinition .

              destination is disabled, events aren't  sent  to  the  specified
              destinations.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
