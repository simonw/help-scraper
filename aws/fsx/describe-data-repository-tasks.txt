NAME
       describe-data-repository-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the description of specific Amazon FSx for Lustre data reposi-
       tory tasks, if one or more TaskIds values are provided in the  request,
       or  if  filters  are used in the request. You can use filters to narrow
       the response to include just tasks for specific file systems, or  tasks
       in  a  specific lifecycle state. Otherwise, it returns all data reposi-
       tory tasks owned by your Amazon Web Services account in the Amazon  Web
       Services Region of the endpoint that you're calling.

       When  retrieving  all tasks, you can paginate the response by using the
       optional MaxResults parameter to limit the number of tasks returned  in
       a  response. If more tasks remain, Amazon FSx returns a NextToken value
       in the response. In this case, send a later request with the  NextToken
       request parameter set to the value of NextToken from the last response.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-data-repository-tasks
          [--task-ids <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --task-ids (list)
          (Optional)  IDs of the tasks whose descriptions you want to retrieve
          (String).

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          (Optional) You can use filters to narrow the DescribeDataRepository-
          Tasks  response  to include just tasks for specific file systems, or
          tasks in a specific lifecycle state.

          (structure)
              (Optional) An array of filter objects you can use to filter  the
              response  of  data  repository tasks you will see in the the re-
              sponse. You can filter the tasks returned in the response by one
              or  more  file  system IDs, task lifecycles, and by task type. A
              filter object consists of a filter Name , and one or more Values
              for the filter.

              Name -> (string)
                 Name  of  the task property to use in filtering the tasks re-
                 turned in the response.

                 o Use file-system-id to retrieve data  repository  tasks  for
                   specific file systems.

                 o Use  task-lifecycle  to retrieve data repository tasks with
                   one or more specific lifecycle  states,  as  follows:  CAN-
                   CELED, EXECUTING, FAILED, PENDING, and SUCCEEDED.

              Values -> (list)
                 Use  Values  to include the specific file system IDs and task
                 lifecycle states for the filters you are using.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "file-system-id"|"task-lifecycle"|"data-repository-association-id",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of resources to  return  in  the  response.  This
          value must be an integer greater than zero.

       --next-token (string)
          (Optional)  Opaque  pagination token returned from a previous opera-
          tion (String). If present, this token indicates from what point  you
          can  continue  processing  the request, where the previous NextToken
          value left off.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DataRepositoryTasks -> (list)
          The collection of data repository task descriptions returned.

          (structure)
              A  description of the data repository task. You use data reposi-
              tory tasks to perform bulk transfer operations between your Ama-
              zon FSx file system and a linked data repository.

              TaskId -> (string)
                 The  system-generated, unique 17-digit ID of the data reposi-
                 tory task.

              Lifecycle -> (string)
                 The lifecycle status of the data repository task, as follows:

                 o PENDING - Amazon FSx has not started the task.

                 o EXECUTING - Amazon FSx is processing the task.

                 o FAILED - Amazon FSx was not able to complete the task.  For
                   example, there may be files the task failed to process. The
                   DataRepositoryTaskFailureDetails property provides more in-
                   formation about task failures.

                 o SUCCEEDED - FSx completed the task successfully.

                 o CANCELED - Amazon FSx canceled the task and it did not com-
                   plete.

                 o CANCELING - FSx is in process of canceling the task.

                 NOTE:
                     You cannot delete an FSx for Lustre file system if  there
                     are  data  repository  tasks  for  the file system in the
                     PENDING or EXECUTING states. Please retry when  the  data
                     repository  task is finished (with a status of CANCELED ,
                     SUCCEEDED  ,  or  FAILED  ).  You   can   use   the   De-
                     scribeDataRepositoryTask  action to monitor the task sta-
                     tus. Contact the FSx team if you need to delete your file
                     system immediately.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of data repository task.

                 o The  EXPORT_TO_REPOSITORY data repository task exports from
                   your Lustre file system from to a linked S3 bucket.

                 o The IMPORT_METADATA_FROM_REPOSITORY  data  repository  task
                   imports  metadata  changes  from a linked S3 bucket to your
                   Lustre file system.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the resource was  created,  in  seconds  (since
                 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z), also known as Unix time.

              StartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that Amazon FSx began processing the task.

              EndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that Amazon FSx completed processing the task, popu-
                 lated after the task is complete.

              ResourceARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for  a  given  resource.  ARNs
                 uniquely  identify  Amazon Web Services resources. We require
                 an ARN when you need  to  specify  a  resource  unambiguously
                 across  all of Amazon Web Services. For more information, see
                 Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services  Gen-
                 eral Reference .

              Tags -> (list)
                 A list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        A  value  that  specifies the TagKey , the name of the
                        tag. Tag keys must be unique for the resource to which
                        they are attached.

                     Value -> (string)
                        A  value  that  specifies the TagValue , the value as-
                        signed to the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be
                        null and don't have to be unique in a tag set. For ex-
                        ample, you can have a key-value pair in a tag  set  of
                        finances : April and also of payroll : April .

              FileSystemId -> (string)
                 The globally unique ID of the file system, assigned by Amazon
                 FSx.

              Paths -> (list)
                 An array of paths on the Amazon FSx for  Lustre  file  system
                 that  specify  the  data  for  the  data  repository  task to
                 process. For example, in an  EXPORT_TO_REPOSITORY  task,  the
                 paths specify which data to export to the linked data reposi-
                 tory.

                 (Default) If Paths is not specified, Amazon FSx uses the file
                 system root directory.

                 (string)

              FailureDetails -> (structure)
                 Failure  message  describing why the task failed, it is popu-
                 lated only when Lifecycle is set to FAILED .

                 Message -> (string)
                     A detailed error message.

              Status -> (structure)
                 Provides the status of the number of files that the task  has
                 processed successfully and failed to process.

                 TotalCount -> (long)
                     The  total  number  of  files that the task will process.
                     While a task is executing, the sum of SucceededCount plus
                     FailedCount  may  not equal TotalCount . When the task is
                     complete, TotalCount equals  the  sum  of  SucceededCount
                     plus FailedCount .

                 SucceededCount -> (long)
                     A  running total of the number of files that the task has
                     successfully processed.

                 FailedCount -> (long)
                     A running total of the number  of  files  that  the  task
                     failed to process.

                 LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                     The time at which the task status was last updated.

              Report -> (structure)
                 Provides  a report detailing the data repository task results
                 of the files processed that match the criteria  specified  in
                 the  report  Scope  parameter. FSx delivers the report to the
                 file system's linked data repository in Amazon S3, using  the
                 path  specified in the report Path parameter. You can specify
                 whether or not a report gets generated for a task  using  the
                 Enabled parameter.

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     Set  Enabled  to True to generate a CompletionReport when
                     the task completes. If set to true ,  then  you  need  to
                     provide  a report Scope , Path , and Format . Set Enabled
                     to False if you do not want a CompletionReport  generated
                     when the task completes.

                 Path -> (string)
                     Required  if Enabled is set to true . Specifies the loca-
                     tion of the report on the file system's  linked  S3  data
                     repository.  An absolute path that defines where the com-
                     pletion report will be stored in  the  destination  loca-
                     tion.  The  Path  you  provide must be located within the
                     file  systems  ExportPath.  An  example  Path  value   is
                     "s3://myBucket/myExportPath/optionalPrefix".  The  report
                     provides the following information for each file  in  the
                     report:  FilePath,  FileStatus,  and  ErrorCode. To learn
                     more about a file system's ExportPath , see .

                 Format -> (string)
                     Required if Enabled is set to true . Specifies the format
                     of the CompletionReport . REPORT_CSV_20191124 is the only
                     format currently supported. When Format  is  set  to  RE-
                     PORT_CSV_20191124  ,  the CompletionReport is provided in
                     CSV format, and is  delivered  to  {path}/task-{id}/fail-
                     ures.csv .

                 Scope -> (string)
                     Required  if Enabled is set to true . Specifies the scope
                     of the CompletionReport ; FAILED_FILES_ONLY is  the  only
                     scope   currently   supported.   When  Scope  is  set  to
                     FAILED_FILES_ONLY , the  CompletionReport  only  contains
                     information  about  files  that  the data repository task
                     failed to process.

       NextToken -> (string)
          (Optional) Opaque pagination token returned from a  previous  opera-
          tion  (String). If present, this token indicates from what point you
          can continue processing the request, where  the  previous  NextToken
          value left off.
