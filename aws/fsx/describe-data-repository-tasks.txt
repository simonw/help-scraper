DESCRIBE-DATA-REPOSITORY-TASKS()              DESCRIBE-DATA-REPOSITORY-TASKS()



NAME
       describe-data-repository-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  description  of  specific Amazon FSx for Lustre or Amazon
       File Cache data repository tasks, if one or  more  TaskIds  values  are
       provided in the request, or if filters are used in the request. You can
       use filters to narrow the response to include just tasks  for  specific
       file  systems or caches, or tasks in a specific lifecycle state. Other-
       wise, it returns all data repository tasks owned  by  your  Amazon  Web
       Services account in the Amazon Web Services Region of the endpoint that
       you're calling.

       When retrieving all tasks, you can paginate the response by  using  the
       optional  MaxResults parameter to limit the number of tasks returned in
       a response. If more tasks remain, a NextToken value is returned in  the
       response. In this case, send a later request with the NextToken request
       parameter set to the value of NextToken from the last response.

OPTIONS
       --task-ids (list)
          (Optional) IDs of the tasks whose descriptions you want to  retrieve
          (String).

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          (Optional) You can use filters to narrow the DescribeDataRepository-
          Tasks response to include just tasks for specific file  systems,  or
          tasks in a specific lifecycle state.

          (structure)
              (Optional)  An array of filter objects you can use to filter the
              response of data repository tasks you will see in  the  the  re-
              sponse. You can filter the tasks returned in the response by one
              or more file system IDs, task lifecycles, and by  task  type.  A
              filter object consists of a filter Name , and one or more Values
              for the filter.

              Name -> (string)
                 Name of the task property to use in filtering the  tasks  re-
                 turned in the response.

                 o Use  file-system-id  to  retrieve data repository tasks for
                   specific file systems.

                 o Use task-lifecycle to retrieve data repository  tasks  with
                   one  or  more  specific  lifecycle states, as follows: CAN-
                   CELED, EXECUTING, FAILED, PENDING, and SUCCEEDED.

              Values -> (list)
                 Use Values to include the specific file system IDs  and  task
                 lifecycle states for the filters you are using.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "file-system-id"|"task-lifecycle"|"data-repository-association-id"|"file-cache-id",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  resources  to return in the response. This
          value must be an integer greater than zero.

       --next-token (string)
          (Optional) Opaque pagination token returned from a  previous  opera-
          tion  (String). If present, this token indicates from what point you
          can continue processing the request, where  the  previous  NextToken
          value left off.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       DataRepositoryTasks -> (list)
          The collection of data repository task descriptions returned.

          (structure)
              A description of the data repository task.

              o You  use  import  and  export data repository tasks to perform
                bulk transfer operations between an Amazon FSx for Lustre file
                system and a linked data repository.

              o You  use  release  data repository tasks to release files that
                have been exported to a linked S3 bucket from your Amazon  FSx
                for Lustre file system.

              o An Amazon File Cache resource uses a task to automatically re-
                lease files from the cache.

              To learn more about data repository tasks, see  Data  Repository
              Tasks .

              TaskId -> (string)
                 The  system-generated, unique 17-digit ID of the data reposi-
                 tory task.

              Lifecycle -> (string)
                 The lifecycle status of the data repository task, as follows:

                 o PENDING - The task has not started.

                 o EXECUTING - The task is in process.

                 o FAILED - The task was not able to be completed.  For  exam-
                   ple,  there  may  be  files the task failed to process. The
                   DataRepositoryTaskFailureDetails property provides more in-
                   formation about task failures.

                 o SUCCEEDED - The task has completed successfully.

                 o CANCELED - The task was canceled and it did not complete.

                 o CANCELING - The task is in process of being canceled.

                 NOTE:
                     You  cannot delete an FSx for Lustre file system if there
                     are data repository tasks for  the  file  system  in  the
                     PENDING  or  EXECUTING states. Please retry when the data
                     repository task is finished (with a status of CANCELED  ,
                     SUCCEEDED   ,   or   FAILED   ).  You  can  use  the  De-
                     scribeDataRepositoryTask action to monitor the task  sta-
                     tus. Contact the FSx team if you need to delete your file
                     system immediately.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of data repository task.

                 o EXPORT_TO_REPOSITORY tasks export from your Amazon FSx  for
                   Lustre file system to a linked data repository.

                 o IMPORT_METADATA_FROM_REPOSITORY   tasks   import   metadata
                   changes from a linked S3 bucket to your Amazon FSx for Lus-
                   tre file system.

                 o RELEASE_DATA_FROM_FILESYSTEM  tasks  release  files in your
                   Amazon FSx for Lustre file system that have  been  exported
                   to  a linked S3 bucket and that meet your specified release
                   criteria.

                 o AUTO_RELEASE_DATA tasks automatically release files from an
                   Amazon File Cache resource.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  that  the  resource was created, in seconds (since
                 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z), also known as Unix time.

              StartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time the system began processing the task.

              EndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time the system completed processing the task,  populated
                 after the task is complete.

              ResourceARN -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) for a given resource. ARNs
                 uniquely identify Amazon Web Services resources.  We  require
                 an  ARN  when  you  need  to specify a resource unambiguously
                 across all of Amazon Web Services. For more information,  see
                 Amazon  Resource Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services Gen-
                 eral Reference .

              Tags -> (list)
                 A list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        A value that specifies the TagKey , the  name  of  the
                        tag. Tag keys must be unique for the resource to which
                        they are attached.

                     Value -> (string)
                        A value that specifies the TagValue ,  the  value  as-
                        signed to the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be
                        null and don't have to be unique in a tag set. For ex-
                        ample,  you  can have a key-value pair in a tag set of
                        finances : April and also of payroll : April .

              FileSystemId -> (string)
                 The globally unique ID of the file system.

                 An array of paths that specify the data for the data  reposi-
                 tory task to process. For example, in an EXPORT_TO_REPOSITORY
                 task, the paths specify which data to export  to  the  linked
                 data repository.

                 (Default) If Paths is not specified, Amazon FSx uses the file
                 system root directory.

                 (string)

              FailureDetails -> (structure)
                 Failure message describing why the task failed, it  is  popu-
                 lated only when Lifecycle is set to FAILED .

                 Message -> (string)
                     A detailed error message.

              Status -> (structure)
                 Provides  the status of the number of files that the task has
                 processed successfully and failed to process.

                 TotalCount -> (long)
                     The total number of files that  the  task  will  process.
                     While a task is executing, the sum of SucceededCount plus
                     FailedCount may not equal TotalCount . When the  task  is
                     complete,  TotalCount  equals  the  sum of SucceededCount
                     plus FailedCount .

                 SucceededCount -> (long)
                     A running total of the number of files that the task  has
                     successfully processed.

                 FailedCount -> (long)
                     A  running  total  of  the  number of files that the task
                     failed to process.

                 LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                     The time at which the task status was last updated.

                 ReleasedCapacity -> (long)
                     The total amount of data, in GiB, released by  an  Amazon
                     File  Cache AUTO_RELEASE_DATA task that automatically re-
                     leases files from the cache.

              Report -> (structure)
                 Provides a report detailing the data repository task  results
                 of  the  files processed that match the criteria specified in
                 the report Scope parameter. FSx delivers the  report  to  the
                 file  system's linked data repository in Amazon S3, using the
                 path specified in the report Path parameter. You can  specify
                 whether  or  not a report gets generated for a task using the
                 Enabled parameter.

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     Set Enabled to True to generate a  CompletionReport  when
                     the  task  completes.  If  set to true , then you need to
                     provide a report Scope , Path , and Format . Set  Enabled
                     to  False if you do not want a CompletionReport generated
                     when the task completes.

                 Path -> (string)
                     Required if Enabled is set to true . Specifies the  loca-
                     tion  of  the  report on the file system's linked S3 data
                     repository. An absolute path that defines where the  com-
                     pletion  report  will  be stored in the destination loca-
                     tion. The Path you provide must  be  located  within  the
                     file   systems  ExportPath.  An  example  Path  value  is
                     "s3://myBucket/myExportPath/optionalPrefix".  The  report
                     provides  the  following information for each file in the
                     report: FilePath, FileStatus, and ErrorCode.

                 Format -> (string)
                     Required if Enabled is set to true . Specifies the format
                     of the CompletionReport . REPORT_CSV_20191124 is the only
                     format currently supported. When Format  is  set  to  RE-
                     PORT_CSV_20191124  ,  the CompletionReport is provided in
                     CSV format, and is  delivered  to  {path}/task-{id}/fail-
                     ures.csv .

                 Scope -> (string)
                     Required  if Enabled is set to true . Specifies the scope
                     of the CompletionReport ; FAILED_FILES_ONLY is  the  only
                     scope   currently   supported.   When  Scope  is  set  to
                     FAILED_FILES_ONLY , the  CompletionReport  only  contains
                     information  about  files  that  the data repository task
                     failed to process.

              CapacityToRelease -> (long)
                 Specifies the amount of data to release, in GiB, by an Amazon
                 File Cache AUTO_RELEASE_DATA task that automatically releases
                 files from the cache.

              FileCacheId -> (string)
                 The system-generated, unique ID of the cache.

              ReleaseConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The configuration that specifies the last accessed time  cri-
                 teria  for files that will be released from an Amazon FSx for
                 Lustre file system.

                 DurationSinceLastAccess -> (structure)
                     Defines the point-in-time since an exported file was last
                     accessed,  in  order for that file to be eligible for re-
                     lease. Only files that were  last  accessed  before  this
                     point-in-time  are  eligible to be released from the file
                     system.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        The unit of time used by the Value parameter to deter-
                        mine  if  a file can be released, based on when it was
                        last accessed. DAYS is the only supported value.  This
                        is a required parameter.

                     Value -> (long)
                        An  integer that represents the minimum amount of time
                        (in days) since a file was last accessed in  the  file
