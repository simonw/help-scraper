SYNOPSIS
            delete-volume
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          --volume-id <value>
          [--ontap-configuration <value>]
          [--open-zfs-configuration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-request-token (string)
          (Optional) An idempotency token for resource creation, in  a  string
          of  up to 64 ASCII characters. This token is automatically filled on
          your behalf when you use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Ama-
          zon Web Services SDK.

       --volume-id (string)
          The ID of the volume that you are deleting.

       --ontap-configuration (structure)
          For  Amazon  FSx  for ONTAP volumes, specify whether to take a final
          backup of the volume and apply tags to the backup. To apply tags  to
          the backup, you must have the fsx:TagResource permission.

          SkipFinalBackup -> (boolean)
              Set  to  true  if  you want to skip taking a final backup of the
              volume you are deleting.

          FinalBackupTags -> (list)
              A list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

              (structure)
                 Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

                 Key -> (string)
                     A value that specifies the TagKey , the name of the  tag.
                     Tag  keys  must  be unique for the resource to which they
                     are attached.

                 Value -> (string)
                     A value that specifies the TagValue , the value  assigned
                     to  the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null and
                     don't have to be unique in a tag set.  For  example,  you
                     can  have  a  key-value  pair  in a tag set of finances :
                     April and also of payroll : April .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SkipFinalBackup=boolean,FinalBackupTags=[{Key=string,Value=string},{Key=string,Value=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SkipFinalBackup": true|false,
            "FinalBackupTags": [
              {
                "Key": "string",
                "Value": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --open-zfs-configuration (structure)
          For Amazon FSx for OpenZFS volumes, specify whether  to  delete  all
          child volumes and snapshots.

          Options -> (list)
              To delete the volume's child volumes, snapshots, and clones, use
              the string DELETE_CHILD_VOLUMES_AND_SNAPSHOTS .

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Options=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Options": ["DELETE_CHILD_VOLUMES_AND_SNAPSHOTS", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
