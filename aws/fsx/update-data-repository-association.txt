NAME
       update-data-repository-association -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the configuration of an existing data repository association on
       an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. Data repository associations  are
       supported only for file systems with the Persistent_2 deployment type.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-data-repository-association
          --association-id <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--imported-file-chunk-size <value>]
          [--s3 <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --association-id (string)
          The ID of the data repository association that you are updating.

       --client-request-token (string)
          (Optional)  An  idempotency token for resource creation, in a string
          of up to 64 ASCII characters. This token is automatically filled  on
          your behalf when you use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Ama-
          zon Web Services SDK.

       --imported-file-chunk-size (integer)
          For files imported from a data repository, this value determines the
          stripe  count and maximum amount of data per file (in MiB) stored on
          a single physical disk. The maximum number of disks  that  a  single
          file  can  be striped across is limited by the total number of disks
          that make up the file system.

          The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go  as  high  as
          512,000  MiB  (500  GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a maximum size of 5
          TB.

       --s3 (structure)
          The configuration for an Amazon S3 data repository linked to an Ama-
          zon  FSx  Lustre file system with a data repository association. The
          configuration defines which file events (new,  changed,  or  deleted
          files  or  directories)  are  automatically imported from the linked
          data repository to the file system or  automatically  exported  from
          the file system to the data repository.

          AutoImportPolicy -> (structure)
              Specifies  the  type  of updated objects (new, changed, deleted)
              that will be automatically imported from the linked S3 bucket to
              your file system.

              Events -> (list)
                 The AutoImportPolicy can have the following event values:

                 o NEW  -  Amazon  FSx automatically imports metadata of files
                   added to the linked S3 bucket that do not  currently  exist
                   in the FSx file system.

                 o CHANGED  -  Amazon  FSx automatically updates file metadata
                   and invalidates existing file content on the file system as
                   files change in the data repository.

                 o DELETED  -  Amazon  FSx  automatically deletes files on the
                   file system as corresponding files are deleted in the  data
                   repository.

                 You  can  define  any combination of event types for your Au-
                 toImportPolicy .

                 (string)

          AutoExportPolicy -> (structure)
              Specifies the type of updated objects  (new,  changed,  deleted)
              that will be automatically exported from your file system to the
              linked S3 bucket.

              Events -> (list)
                 The AutoExportPolicy can have the following event values:

                 o NEW - Amazon FSx automatically exports new files and direc-
                   tories to the data repository as they are added to the file
                   system.

                 o CHANGED - Amazon FSx automatically exports changes to files
                   and directories on the file system to the data repository.

                 o DELETED  -  Files and directories are automatically deleted
                   on the data repository when they are deleted  on  the  file
                   system.

                 You  can define any combination of event types for your Auto-
                 ExportPolicy .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AutoImportPolicy={Events=[string,string]},AutoExportPolicy={Events=[string,string]}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AutoImportPolicy": {
              "Events": ["NEW"|"CHANGED"|"DELETED", ...]
            },
            "AutoExportPolicy": {
              "Events": ["NEW"|"CHANGED"|"DELETED", ...]
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Association -> (structure)
          The  response  object returned after the data repository association
          is updated.

          AssociationId -> (string)
              The system-generated, unique ID of the data repository  associa-
              tion.

          ResourceARN -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  for  a  given resource. ARNs
              uniquely identify Amazon Web Services resources. We  require  an
              ARN when you need to specify a resource unambiguously across all
              of Amazon Web Services. For more  information,  see  Amazon  Re-
              source Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference
              .

          FileSystemId -> (string)
              The globally unique ID of the file system,  assigned  by  Amazon
              FSx.

          Lifecycle -> (string)
              Describes  the state of a data repository association. The life-
              cycle can have the following values:

              o CREATING - The data repository  association  between  the  FSx
                file  system  and the S3 data repository is being created. The
                data repository is unavailable.

              o AVAILABLE - The data repository association is  available  for
                use.

              o MISCONFIGURED - Amazon FSx cannot automatically import updates
                from the S3 bucket or automatically export updates to  the  S3
                bucket  until the data repository association configuration is
                corrected.

              o UPDATING - The data repository  association  is  undergoing  a
                customer initiated update that might affect its availability.

              o DELETING  -  The  data  repository association is undergoing a
                customer initiated deletion.

              o FAILED - The data repository  association  is  in  a  terminal
                state that cannot be recovered.

          FailureDetails -> (structure)
              Provides  detailed information about the data respository if its
              Lifecycle is set to MISCONFIGURED or FAILED .

              Message -> (string)
                 A detailed error message.

          FileSystemPath -> (string)
              A path on the file system that points to a high-level  directory
              (such  as  /ns1/  ) or subdirectory (such as /ns1/subdir/ ) that
              will be mapped 1-1 with DataRepositoryPath . The leading forward
              slash  in the name is required. Two data repository associations
              cannot have overlapping file system paths.  For  example,  if  a
              data repository is associated with file system path /ns1/ , then
              you cannot link another data repository with  file  system  path
              /ns1/ns2 .

              This  path specifies where in your file system files will be ex-
              ported from or imported to. This file system  directory  can  be
              linked  to only one Amazon S3 bucket, and no other S3 bucket can
              be linked to the directory.

          DataRepositoryPath -> (string)
              The path to the Amazon S3 data repository that will be linked to
              the  file  system. The path can be an S3 bucket or prefix in the
              format s3://myBucket/myPrefix/ . This path  specifies  where  in
              the  S3  data repository files will be imported from or exported
              to.

          BatchImportMetaDataOnCreate -> (boolean)
              A boolean flag indicating whether an import data repository task
              to import metadata should run after the data repository associa-
              tion is created. The task runs if this flag is set to true .

          ImportedFileChunkSize -> (integer)
              For files imported from a data repository, this value determines
              the  stripe  count  and maximum amount of data per file (in MiB)
              stored on a single physical disk. The maximum  number  of  disks
              that a single file can be striped across is limited by the total
              number of disks that make up the file system.

              The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go  as  high
              as  512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a maximum size
              of 5 TB.

          S3 -> (structure)
              The configuration for an Amazon S3 data repository linked to  an
              Amazon  FSx  Lustre  file system with a data repository associa-
              tion. The configuration defines which file events (new, changed,
              or deleted files or directories) are automatically imported from
              the linked data repository to the file system  or  automatically
              exported from the file system to the data repository.

              AutoImportPolicy -> (structure)
                 Specifies the type of updated objects (new, changed, deleted)
                 that will be automatically imported from the linked S3 bucket
                 to your file system.

                 Events -> (list)
                     The AutoImportPolicy can have the following event values:

                     o NEW  -  Amazon  FSx  automatically  imports metadata of
                       files added to the linked S3 bucket that  do  not  cur-
                       rently exist in the FSx file system.

                     o CHANGED  -  Amazon FSx automatically updates file meta-
                       data and invalidates existing file content on the  file
                       system as files change in the data repository.

                     o DELETED - Amazon FSx automatically deletes files on the
                       file system as corresponding files are deleted  in  the
                       data repository.

                     You  can  define  any combination of event types for your
                     AutoImportPolicy .

                     (string)

              AutoExportPolicy -> (structure)
                 Specifies the type of updated objects (new, changed, deleted)
                 that  will be automatically exported from your file system to
                 the linked S3 bucket.

                 Events -> (list)
                     The AutoExportPolicy can have the following event values:

                     o NEW - Amazon FSx automatically exports  new  files  and
                       directories to the data repository as they are added to
                       the file system.

                     o CHANGED - Amazon FSx automatically exports  changes  to
                       files  and  directories  on the file system to the data
                       repository.

                     o DELETED  -  Files  and  directories  are  automatically
                       deleted on the data repository when they are deleted on
                       the file system.

                     You can define any combination of event  types  for  your
                     AutoExportPolicy .

                     (string)

          Tags -> (list)
              A list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

              (structure)
                 Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

                 Key -> (string)
                     A  value that specifies the TagKey , the name of the tag.
                     Tag keys must be unique for the resource  to  which  they
                     are attached.

                 Value -> (string)
                     A  value that specifies the TagValue , the value assigned
                     to the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null  and
                     don't  have  to  be unique in a tag set. For example, you
                     can have a key-value pair in a  tag  set  of  finances  :
                     April and also of payroll : April .

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The  time  that  the  resource  was  created,  in seconds (since
              1970-01-01T00:00:00Z), also known as Unix time.
