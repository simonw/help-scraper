DESCRIBE-SNAPSHOTS()                                      DESCRIBE-SNAPSHOTS()



NAME
       describe-snapshots -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  description of specific Amazon FSx for OpenZFS snapshots,
       if a SnapshotIds value is provided. Otherwise, this  operation  returns
       all  snapshots  owned by your Amazon Web Services account in the Amazon
       Web Services Region of the endpoint that you're calling.

       When retrieving all snapshots, you can optionally  specify  the  MaxRe-
       sults parameter to limit the number of snapshots in a response. If more
       backups remain, Amazon FSx returns a NextToken value in  the  response.
       In this case, send a later request with the NextToken request parameter
       set to the value of NextToken from the last response.

       Use this operation in an iterative process to retrieve a list  of  your
       snapshots. DescribeSnapshots is called first without a NextToken value.
       Then the operation continues to be called with the NextToken  parameter
       set  to  the  value of the last NextToken value until a response has no
       NextToken value.

       When using this operation, keep the following in mind:

       o The operation might return fewer than the MaxResults value  of  snap-
         shot descriptions while still including a NextToken value.

       o The  order of snapshots returned in the response of one DescribeSnap-
         shots call and the order of backups returned across the responses  of
         a multi-call iteration is unspecified.

OPTIONS
       --snapshot-ids (list)
          The  IDs  of the snapshots that you want to retrieve. This parameter
          value overrides any filters. If any IDs aren't found, a SnapshotNot-
          Found error occurs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          The  filters  structure.  The  supported names are file-system-id or
          volume-id .

          (structure)
              A filter used  to  restrict  the  results  of  DescribeSnapshots
              calls.  You can use multiple filters to return results that meet
              all applied filter requirements.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of  the  filter  to  use.  You  can  filter  by  the
                 file-system-id or by volume-id .

              Values -> (list)
                 The file-system-id or volume-id that you are filtering for.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "file-system-id"|"volume-id",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  resources  to return in the response. This
          value must be an integer greater than zero.

       --next-token (string)
          (Optional) Opaque pagination token returned from a  previous  opera-
          tion  (String). If present, this token indicates from what point you
          can continue processing the request, where  the  previous  NextToken
          value left off.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                        signed to the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be
                        null and don't have to be unique in a tag set. For ex-
                        ample,  you  can have a key-value pair in a tag set of
                        finances : April and also of payroll : April .

              AdministrativeActions -> (list)
                 A list of administrative actions for the file system that are
                 in process or waiting to be processed. Administrative actions
                 describe changes to the Amazon FSx system.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a specific Amazon FSx administrative action for
                     the current Windows, Lustre, or OpenZFS file system.

                     AdministrativeActionType -> (string)
                        Describes  the  type of administrative action, as fol-
                        lows:

                        o FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE - A file system  update  adminis-
                          trative  action  initiated  from the Amazon FSx con-
                          sole,  API  (UpdateFileSystem   ),   or   CLI   (up-
                          date-file-system ).

                        o STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION  - After the FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE
                          task to increase a file  system's  storage  capacity
                          has been completed successfully, a STORAGE_OPTIMIZA-
                          TION task starts.

                          o For Windows and ONTAP, storage optimization is the
                            process of migrating the file system data to newer
                            larger disks.

                          o For Lustre, storage optimization consists  of  re-
                            balancing  the  data across the existing and newly
                            added file servers.

                        You can track the storage-optimization progress  using
                        the  ProgressPercent  property. When STORAGE_OPTIMIZA-
                        TION  has  been  completed  successfully,  the  parent
                        FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE  action status changes to COMPLETED
                        . For more information, see Managing storage  capacity
                        in the Amazon FSx for Windows File Server User Guide ,

                        o FILE_SYSTEM_ALIAS_ASSOCIATION - A file system update
                          to associate a new Domain Name  System  (DNS)  alias
                          with  the  file  system.  For  more information, see
                          AssociateFileSystemAliases .

                        o FILE_SYSTEM_ALIAS_DISASSOCIATION - A file system up-
                          date  to disassociate a DNS alias from the file sys-
                          tem.      For      more       information,       see
                          DisassociateFileSystemAliases .

                        o VOLUME_UPDATE - A volume update to an Amazon FSx for
                          NetApp ONTAP or Amazon FSx for OpenZFS volume initi-
                          ated  from the Amazon FSx console, API (UpdateVolume
                          ), or CLI (update-volume ).

                        o VOLUME_RESTORE - An Amazon FSx for OpenZFS volume is
                          returned  to  the state saved by the specified snap-
                          shot, initiated from an API  (RestoreVolumeFromSnap-
                          shot ) or CLI (restore-volume-from-snapshot ).

                        o SNAPSHOT_UPDATE - A snapshot update to an Amazon FSx
                          for OpenZFS volume initiated  from  the  Amazon  FSx
                          console, API (UpdateSnapshot ), or CLI (update-snap-
                          shot ).

                        o RELEASE_NFS_V3_LOCKS - Tracks the release of Network
                          File  System  (NFS)  V3  locks  on an Amazon FSx for
                          OpenZFS file system.

                     ProgressPercent -> (integer)
                        The percentage-complete status of a  STORAGE_OPTIMIZA-
                        TION  administrative  action.  Does  not  apply to any
                        other administrative action type.

                     RequestTime -> (timestamp)
                        The time that the administrative  action  request  was

                          administrative task.

                        o UPDATED_OPTIMIZING - For a storage-capacity increase
                          update,  Amazon FSx has updated the file system with
                          the new storage capacity, and is now performing  the
                          storage-optimization process.

                     TargetFileSystemValues -> (structure)
                        Describes  the target value for the administration ac-
                        tion, provided in the UpdateFileSystem operation.  Re-
                        turned for FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE administrative actions.

                            DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                               The  preferred  time  to  take  daily automatic
                               backups, in the UTC time zone.

                            AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                               The number of days to retain automatic backups.
                               Setting  this  to 0 disables automatic backups.
                               You can retain automatic backups for a  maximum
                               of 90 days.

                            CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                               A  boolean  flag indicating whether tags on the
                               file system should be copied to  backups.  This
                               value  defaults  to false. If it's set to true,
                               all tags on the file system are copied  to  all
                               automatic  backups and any user-initiated back-
                               ups where the user doesn't specify any tags. If
                               this value is true, and you specify one or more
                               tags, only the specified  tags  are  copied  to
                               backups.  If  you specify one or more tags when
                               creating a user-initiated backup, no  tags  are
                               copied from the file system, regardless of this
                               value.

                            Aliases -> (list)
                               An array of one or more DNS  aliases  that  are
                               currently  associated  with the Amazon FSx file
                               system. Aliases allow you to use  existing  DNS
                               names  to  access  the  data in your Amazon FSx
                               file system. You can associate up to 50 aliases
                               with  a  file system at any time. You can asso-
                               ciate additional DNS aliases after  you  create
                               the  file  system  using  the AssociateFileSys-
                               temAliases  operation.  You  can   remove   DNS
                               aliases  from  the file system after it is cre-
                               ated  using  the  DisassociateFileSystemAliases
                               operation.  You  only need to specify the alias
                               name in the request payload. For more  informa-
                               tion, see DNS aliases .

                               (structure)
                                   A  DNS  alias  that  is associated with the
                                   file system. You can use a DNS alias to ac-
                                   cess  a  file system using user-defined DNS
                                   names, in addition to the default DNS  name
                                   that Amazon FSx assigns to the file system.
                                   For more information, see  DNS  aliases  in

                                        name (FQDN), hostname.domain , for ex-
                                        ample, accounting.example.com .

                                      o Can contain  alphanumeric  characters,
                                        the  underscore  (_),  and  the hyphen
                                        (-).

                                      o Cannot start or end with a hyphen.

                                      o Can start with a numeric.

                                      For DNS names, Amazon FSx stores  alpha-
                                      betic  characters  as  lowercase letters
                                      (a-z), regardless  of  how  you  specify
                                      them:  as  uppercase  letters, lowercase
                                      letters, or the corresponding letters in
                                      escape codes.

                                      o CREATING - Amazon FSx is creating  the
                                        DNS  alias and associating it with the
                                        file system.

                                      o CREATE_FAILED - Amazon FSx was  unable
                                        to  associate  the  DNS alias with the
                                        file system.

                                      o DELETING - Amazon FSx is  disassociat-
                                        ing the DNS alias from the file system
                                        and deleting it.

                                      o DELETE_FAILED - Amazon FSx was  unable
                                        to disassociate the DNS alias from the
                                        file system.

                                   stored on a single physical disk. The maxi-
                                   mum  number of disks that a single file can
                                   be striped across is limited by  the  total
                                   number  of disks that make up the file sys-
                                   tem.

                                   The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB)
                                   and  can  go  as  high  as 512,000 MiB (500
                                   GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a maximum size
                                   of 5 TB.

                               AutoImportPolicy -> (string)
                                   Describes  the file system's linked S3 data
                                   repository's AutoImportPolicy . The AutoIm-
                                   portPolicy  configures how Amazon FSx keeps
                                   your file and directory listings up to date
                                   as you add or modify objects in your linked
                                   S3 bucket. AutoImportPolicy  can  have  the
                                   following values:

                               FailureDetails -> (structure)
                                   Provides  detailed  information  about  the
                                   data  repository if its Lifecycle is set to
                                   MISCONFIGURED or FAILED .

                                   Message -> (string)
                                      A detailed error message.

                            DeploymentType -> (string)
                               The deployment type of the FSx for Lustre  file
                               system. Scratch deployment type is designed for
                               temporary storage and  shorter-term  processing
                               of data.
                                   SCRATCH_1  and  SCRATCH_2  deployment types
                                   are best suited for when you need temporary
                                   storage   and  shorter-term  processing  of
                                   data. The SCRATCH_2  deployment  type  pro-
                                   vides  in-transit  encryption  of  data and
                                   higher  burst  throughput   capacity   than
                                   SCRATCH_1 .

                               The  PERSISTENT_1  and  PERSISTENT_2 deployment
                               type is used for longer-term storage and  work-
                               loads  and  encryption of data in transit. PER-
                               SISTENT_2 is built on Lustre v2.12  and  offers
                               higher  PerUnitStorageThroughput  (up  to  1000
                               MB/s/TiB) along with a  lower  minimum  storage
                               capacity  requirement  (600 GiB). To learn more
                               about FSx for Lustre deployment types, see  FSx
                               for Lustre deployment options .

                               The default is SCRATCH_1 .

                            PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
                               Per  unit  storage  throughput  represents  the
                               megabytes per second of read or write  through-
                               put per 1 tebibyte of storage provisioned. File
                               system throughput capacity is equal to  Storage
                               capacity   (TiB)   *   PerUnitStorageThroughput
                               (MB/s/TiB). This option is only valid for  PER-
                               SISTENT_1 and PERSISTENT_2 deployment types.

                               Valid values:

                               o For PERSISTENT_1 SSD storage: 50, 100, 200.

                               o For PERSISTENT_1 HDD storage: 12, 40.

                               o For  PERSISTENT_2 SSD storage: 125, 250, 500,
                                 1000.

                            MountName -> (string)
                               You use the MountName value when  mounting  the
                               file system.

                               For  the  SCRATCH_1 deployment type, this value
                               is always "fsx ". For SCRATCH_2 ,  PERSISTENT_1
                               , and PERSISTENT_2 deployment types, this value
                               is a string that is unique within an Amazon Web
                               Services Region.

                            DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                               A  recurring  daily time, in the format HH:MM .
                               HH is the zero-padded hour of the  day  (0-23),
                               and  MM  is the zero-padded minute of the hour.
                               For example, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                            AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                               The number of days to retain automatic backups.
                               Setting  this  property to 0 disables automatic
                               backups. You can retain automatic backups for a
                               maximum of 90 days. The default is 0 .

                            CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                               A  boolean  flag indicating whether tags on the
                               file system are copied to backups. If it's  set
                               to true, all tags on the file system are copied
                               to all automatic backups and any user-initiated
                               backups  where  the  user  doesn't  specify any
                               tags. If this value is true,  and  you  specify
                               one  or  more tags, only the specified tags are
                               copied to backups. If you specify one  or  more
                               tags  when creating a user-initiated backup, no
                               tags are copied from the file  system,  regard-
                               less of this value. (Default = false)

                            DriveCacheType -> (string)
                               The  type  of  drive cache used by PERSISTENT_1
                               file systems  that  are  provisioned  with  HDD
                               storage  devices.  This  parameter  is required
                               when StorageType is HDD. When set to  READ  the
                               file  system  has  an SSD storage cache that is
                               sized to 20% of the file system's  storage  ca-
                               pacity.  This improves the performance for fre-
                               quently accessed files by caching up to 20%  of
                               the total storage capacity.

                               This  parameter is required when StorageType is
                               set to HDD.

                            DataCompressionType -> (string)
                               The data compression configuration for the file
                               system.  DataCompressionType  can have the fol-
                               lowing values:

                               o NONE - Data compression is turned off for the
                                 file system.

                               o LZ4  - Data compression is turned on with the
                                 LZ4 algorithm.

                               For more information, see Lustre data  compres-
                               sion .

                            LogConfiguration -> (structure)
                               The  Lustre  logging configuration. Lustre log-
                               ging writes the enabled  log  events  for  your
                               file system to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

                               Level -> (string)
                                   The  data repository events that are logged
                                   by Amazon FSx.

                                   o WARN_ONLY  -  only  warning  events   are
                                     logged.

                                   o ERROR_ONLY   -   only  error  events  are
                                     logged.

                                   o WARN_ERROR - both warning events and  er-
                                     ror events are logged.

                                   o DISABLED  -  logging  of  data repository
                                     events is turned off.

                                   Note that Amazon File Cache uses a  default
                                   setting  of  WARN_ERROR  ,  which  can't be
                                   changed.

                               Destination -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that  speci-
                                   fies  the destination of the logs. The des-
                                   tination can be any Amazon CloudWatch  Logs
                                   log  group ARN. The destination ARN must be
                                   in the same Amazon Web Services  partition,
                                   Amazon  Web Services Region, and Amazon Web
                                   Services account as your  Amazon  FSx  file
                                   system.

                            RootSquashConfiguration -> (structure)
                               The  Lustre  root  squash  configuration for an
                               Amazon FSx for Lustre  file  system.  When  en-
                               abled,  root squash restricts root-level access
                               from clients that try to access your file  sys-
                               tem as a root user.

                               RootSquash -> (string)
                                   You enable root squash by setting a user ID
                                   (UID) and group ID (GID) for the file  sys-
                                   tem  in  the  format  UID:GID (for example,
                                   365534:65534 ). The UID and GID values  can
                                   range from 0 to 4294967294 :

                                   o A  non-zero value for UID and GID enables
                                     root squash. The UID and GID  values  can
                                     be different, but each must be a non-zero
                                     value.

                                   o A value of 0 (zero) for UID and GID indi-
                                     cates  root,  and therefore disables root
                                     squash.

                                   When root squash is enabled,  the  user  ID
                                   and  group  ID of a root user accessing the
                                   file system are re-mapped to  the  UID  and
                                   GID you provide.

                               NoSquashNids -> (list)
                                   When  root  squash  is enabled, you can op-
                                   tionally  specify  an  array  of  NIDs   of
                                   clients  for which root squash does not ap-
                                   ply. A client NID is a Lustre Network Iden-
                                   tifier  used to uniquely identify a client.
                                   You can specify the NID as either a  single
                                   address or a range of addresses:

                                   o A single address is described in standard
                                     Lustre  NID  format  by  specifying   the
                                     clients IP address followed by the Lustre
                                     network ID (for example, 10.0.1.6@tcp ).

                                   o An address range  is  described  using  a
                                     dash  to separate the range (for example,
                                     10.0.[2-10].[1-255]@tcp ).

                                      cloud (VPC) for the file system.

                                   SubnetIds -> (list)
                                      Specifies the IDs of  the  subnets  that
                                      the  file system is accessible from. For
                                      the  Amazon  FSx   Windows   and   ONTAP
                                      MULTI_AZ_1  file system deployment type,
                                      there are two subnet IDs,  one  for  the
                                      preferred  file  server  and one for the
                                      standby file server. The preferred  file
                                      server  subnet  identified  in  the Pre-
                                      ferredSubnetID property. All other  file
                                      systems have only one subnet ID.

                                      For  FSx  for  Lustre  file systems, and
                                      Single-AZ Windows file systems, this  is
                                      the  ID  of the subnet that contains the
                                      file system's endpoint.  For  MULTI_AZ_1
                                      Windows and ONTAP file systems, the file
                                      system endpoint is available in the Pre-
                                      ferredSubnetID .

                                          creating a user-initiated backup, no
                                          tags are copied from the  file  sys-

                                          only  the  specified tags are copied
                                          to snapshots. If you specify one  or

                                          shot, no tags are  copied  from  the
                                          volume, regardless of this value.

                                      StorageVirtualMachineId -> (string)
                                          The  ID of the volume's storage vir-
                                          tual machine.

                                      StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                                          A Boolean  flag  indicating  whether
                                          this  volume  is the root volume for
                                          its storage virtual  machine  (SVM).
                                          Only one volume on an SVM can be the
                                          root volume. This value defaults  to
                                          false . If this value is true , then
                                          this is the SVM root volume.

                                          This  flag  is  useful  when  you're
                                          deleting  an  SVM,  because you must
                                          first delete all  non-root  volumes.
                                          This flag, when set to false , helps
                                          you identify which volumes to delete
                                          before you can delete the SVM.

                                          the volume. There are three built-in
                                          snapshot policies:

                                          o default : This is the default pol-
                                            icy. A maximum of six hourly snap-
                                            shots  taken five minutes past the
                                            hour. A maximum of two daily snap-
                                            shots  taken Monday through Satur-
                                            day at 10 minutes after  midnight.
                                            A  maximum of two weekly snapshots
                                            taken every Sunday at  15  minutes
                                            after midnight.

                                          o default-1weekly  :  This policy is
                                            the same as the default policy ex-
                                            cept  that  it  only  retains  one
                                            snapshot from the weekly schedule.

                                          o none : This policy does  not  take
                                            any  snapshots. This policy can be
                                            assigned to volumes to prevent au-
                                            tomatic   snapshots   from   being
                                            taken.

                                          You can also provide the name  of  a
                                          custom  policy that you created with
                                          the ONTAP CLI or REST API.

                                      CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                          A boolean  flag  indicating  whether
                                          tags for the volume should be copied
                                          to backups. This value  defaults  to
                                          false. If it's set to true, all tags
                                          for the volume are copied to all au-
                                          tomatic  and  user-initiated backups
                                          where the user doesn't specify tags.
                                          If this value is true, and you spec-
                                          ify one or more tags, only the spec-
                                          ified tags are copied to backups. If
                                          you specify one or  more  tags  when
                                          creating a user-initiated backup, no
                                          tags are copied from the volume, re-
                                          gardless of this value.

                                          Key -> (string)
                                             A value that specifies the TagKey
                                             , the name of the tag.  Tag  keys
                                             must  be  unique for the resource
                                             to which they are attached.

                                          Value -> (string)
                                             A value that specifies  the  Tag-

                                             corresponding tag key. Tag values
                                             can  be null and don't have to be
                                             unique in a tag set. For example,
                                             you  can have a key-value pair in
                                             a tag set of finances : April and
                                             also of payroll : April .

                                      The reason why the volume lifecycle sta-
                                      tus changed.

                                      Message -> (string)
                                          A detailed error message.

                                   OpenZFSConfiguration -> (structure)
                                      The  configuration  of an Amazon FSx for
                                      OpenZFS volume.

                                      ParentVolumeId -> (string)
                                          The ID of the parent volume.

                                          The path to the volume from the root
                                          volume.  For example, fsx/parentVol-
                                          ume/volume1 .

                                      StorageCapacityReservationGiB ->  (inte-
                                      ger)
                                          The  amount  of storage in gibibytes
                                          (GiB) to  reserve  from  the  parent
                                          volume. You can't reserve more stor-
                                          age than the parent volume  has  re-
                                          served.

                                      StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                                          The  maximum  amount  of  storage in
                                          gibibtyes (GiB) that the volume  can
                                          use from its parent. You can specify
                                          a quota larger than the  storage  on
                                          the parent volume.

                                      RecordSizeKiB -> (integer)

                                          ume, in kibibytes (KiB). Valid  val-
                                          ues  are 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256,
                                          512, or 1024 KiB. The default is 128
                                          KiB.  Most  workloads should use the
                                          default record size. For guidance on
                                          when  to  set  a custom record size,
                                          see the Amazon FSx for OpenZFS  User

                                      DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                          Specifies  the  method  used to com-
                                          press the data on  the  volume.  The
                                          compression type is NONE by default.

                                          o NONE  -  Doesn't compress the data
                                            on the volume.  NONE  is  the  de-
                                            fault.

                                          o ZSTD  - Compresses the data in the
                                            volume using the Zstandard  (ZSTD)
                                            compression algorithm. Compared to
                                            LZ4, Z-Standard provides a  better
                                            compression   ratio   to  minimize
                                            on-disk storage utilization.

                                          o LZ4 - Compresses the data  in  the
                                            volume  using  the LZ4 compression
                                            algorithm. Compared to Z-Standard,
                                            LZ4  is less compute-intensive and
                                            delivers higher  write  throughput
                                            speeds.

                                      CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                          A  Boolean  value indicating whether
                                          tags for the volume should be copied
                                          to snapshots. This value defaults to
                                          false . If it's set to  true  ,  all
                                          tags  for  the  volume are copied to
                                          snapshots  where  the  user  doesn't
                                          specify  tags. If this value is true
                                          and you specify one  or  more  tags,
                                          only  the  specified tags are copied
                                          to snapshots. If you specify one  or
                                          more  tags  when  creating the snap-
                                          shot, no tags are  copied  from  the
                                          volume, regardless of this value.

                                      OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                                          The configuration object that speci-
                                          fies the snapshot to use as the ori-
                                          gin of the data for the volume.

                                          SnapshotARN -> (string)
                                             The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN)
                                             for  a   given   resource.   ARNs
                                             uniquely identify Amazon Web Ser-
                                             vices resources.  We  require  an
                                             ARN  when  you  need to specify a

                                             The strategy  used  when  copying

                               all tags for the volume are copied to snapshots
                               where the user doesn't specify  tags.  If  this
                               value is true and you specify one or more tags,
                               only the specified tags  are  copied  to  snap-
                               shots.  If  you  specify  one or more tags when
                               creating the snapshot, no tags are copied  from

                               volume. Valid values are the following:

                               o NONE specifies that the volume doesn't have a
                                 FlexCache configuration. NONE is the default.

                               o ORIGIN specifies that the volume is the  ori-
                                 gin volume for a FlexCache volume.

                               o CACHE  specifies  that  the volume is a Flex-
                                 Cache volume.

                            JunctionPath -> (string)
                               Specifies the directory  that  network-attached
                               storage  (NAS) clients use to mount the volume,
                               along with the storage  virtual  machine  (SVM)
                               Domain  Name  System  (DNS) name or IP address.
                               You can create a JunctionPath directly below  a
                               parent volume junction or on a directory within
                               a volume. A JunctionPath  for  a  volume  named
                               vol3    might    be    /vol1/vol2/vol3   ,   or
                               /vol1/dir2/vol3 , or even /dir1/dir2/vol3 .

                            SecurityStyle -> (string)

                               The volume's storage efficiency setting.

                            StorageVirtualMachineId -> (string)
                               The ID of the volume's storage virtual machine.

                            StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                               A Boolean flag indicating whether  this  volume
                               is  the root volume for its storage virtual ma-
                               chine (SVM). Only one volume on an SVM  can  be
                               the root volume. This value defaults to false .
                               If this value is true , then this  is  the  SVM
                               root volume.

                               This  flag  is  useful  when you're deleting an
                               SVM, because you must first delete all non-root
                               volumes.  This  flag, when set to false , helps
                               you identify which volumes to delete before you
                               can delete the SVM.

                            TieringPolicy -> (structure)
                               The volume's TieringPolicy setting.

                               CoolingPeriod -> (integer)
                                   Specifies the number of days that user data
                                   in a volume must remain inactive before  it
                                   is  considered  "cold" and moved to the ca-
                                   pacity pool. Used with the AUTO  and  SNAP-
                                   SHOT_ONLY  tiering  policies. Enter a whole
                                   number between 2 and  183.  Default  values
                                   are  31  days for AUTO and 2 days for SNAP-
                                   SHOT_ONLY .

                               Name -> (string)
                                   Specifies the tiering policy used to  tran-
                                   sition data. Default value is SNAPSHOT_ONLY
                                   .

                                   o SNAPSHOT_ONLY - moves cold  snapshots  to
                                     the capacity pool storage tier.

                                   o AUTO - moves cold user data and snapshots
                                     to the capacity pool storage  tier  based
                                     on your access patterns.

                                   o ALL  - moves all user data blocks in both
                                     the  active  file  system  and   Snapshot
                                     copies to the storage pool tier.

                                   o NONE  - keeps a volume's data in the pri-
                                     mary storage tier, preventing it from be-
                                     ing moved to the capacity pool tier.

                            UUID -> (string)
                               The   volume's  universally  unique  identifier
                               (UUID).

                            OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                               Specifies the type of volume. Valid values  are
                               the following:

                               o RW  specifies  a read/write volume. RW is the
                                 default.

                               o DP specifies a  data-protection  volume.  You
                                 can   protect   data  by  replicating  it  to
                                 data-protection mirror copies. If a  disaster
                                 occurs,  you  can  use  these data-protection
                                 mirror copies to recover data.

                               o LS specifies a load-sharing mirror volume.  A
                                 load-sharing mirror reduces the network traf-
                                 fic to a FlexVol volume  by  providing  addi-
                                 tional read-only access to clients.

                            SnapshotPolicy -> (string)
                               Specifies  the  snapshot policy for the volume.
                               There are three built-in snapshot policies:

                               o default : This is the default policy. A maxi-
                                 mum  of  six hourly snapshots taken five min-
                                 utes past the hour. A maximum  of  two  daily
                                 snapshots taken Monday through Saturday at 10
                                 minutes after  midnight.  A  maximum  of  two
                                 weekly  snapshots  taken  every  Sunday at 15
                                 minutes after midnight.

                               o default-1weekly : This policy is the same  as
                                 the  default  policy  except that it only re-
                                 tains one snapshot from the weekly schedule.

                               o none : This policy does not  take  any  snap-
                                 shots. This policy can be assigned to volumes
                                 to prevent  automatic  snapshots  from  being
                                 taken.

                               You  can also provide the name of a custom pol-
                               icy that you created with the ONTAP CLI or REST
                               API.

                               For  more information, see Snapshot policies in
                               the Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP User Guide .

                            CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                               A boolean flag indicating whether tags for  the
                               volume  should be copied to backups. This value
                               defaults to false. If it's  set  to  true,  all
                               tags for the volume are copied to all automatic
                               and  user-initiated  backups  where  the   user
                               doesn't  specify  tags.  If this value is true,
                               and you specify one  or  more  tags,  only  the
                               specified  tags  are  copied to backups. If you
                               specify  one  or  more  tags  when  creating  a
                               user-initiated  backup, no tags are copied from
                               the volume, regardless of this value.

                        ResourceARN -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  for  a  given  re-
                            source. ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web Services

                                          SISTENT_1 file systems that are pro-
                                          visioned with HDD  storage  devices.
                                          This   parameter  is  required  when
                                          StorageType is HDD. When set to READ
                                          the  file  system has an SSD storage
                                          cache that is sized to  20%  of  the
                                          file system's storage capacity. This
                                          improves the  performance  for  fre-
                                          quently accessed files by caching up
                                          to 20% of the total  storage  capac-

                                          system as a root user.

                                          RootSquash -> (string)
                                             You enable root squash by setting
                                             a  user  ID  (UID)  and  group ID
                                             (GID) for the file system in  the
                                             format   UID:GID   (for  example,
                                             365534:65534 ). The UID  and  GID
                                             values   can   range  from  0  to

                                      StorageVirtualMachineId -> (string)
                                          The ID of the volume's storage  vir-
                                          tual machine.

                                      StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                                          A  Boolean  flag  indicating whether
                                          this volume is the root  volume  for
                                          its  storage  virtual machine (SVM).
                                          Only one volume on an SVM can be the
                                          root  volume. This value defaults to
                                          false . If this value is true , then
                                          this is the SVM root volume.

                                          This  flag  is  useful  when  you're
                                          deleting an SVM,  because  you  must
                                          first  delete  all non-root volumes.
                                          This flag, when set to false , helps
                                          you identify which volumes to delete
                                          before you can delete the SVM.

                                      SnapshotPolicy -> (string)
                                          Specifies the  snapshot  policy  for
                                          the volume. There are three built-in
                                          snapshot policies:

                                          o default : This is the default pol-
                                            icy. A maximum of six hourly snap-
                                            shots taken five minutes past  the
                                            hour. A maximum of two daily snap-
                                            shots taken Monday through  Satur-
                                            day  at 10 minutes after midnight.
                                            A maximum of two weekly  snapshots
                                            taken  every  Sunday at 15 minutes
                                            after midnight.

                                          o default-1weekly : This  policy  is
                                            the same as the default policy ex-
                                            cept  that  it  only  retains  one
                                            snapshot from the weekly schedule.

                                          o none  :  This policy does not take
                                            any snapshots. This policy can  be
                                            assigned to volumes to prevent au-
                                            tomatic   snapshots   from   being
                                            taken.

                                          You  can  also provide the name of a
                                          custom policy that you created  with
                                          the ONTAP CLI or REST API.

                                      CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                          A  boolean  flag  indicating whether
                                          tags for the volume should be copied
                                          to  backups.  This value defaults to
                                          false. If it's set to true, all tags
                                          for the volume are copied to all au-
                                          tomatic and  user-initiated  backups
                                          where the user doesn't specify tags.
                                          If this value is true, and you spec-
                                          ify one or more tags, only the spec-
                                          ified tags are copied to backups. If
                                          you  specify  one  or more tags when
                                          creating a user-initiated backup, no
                                          tags are copied from the volume, re-
                                          gardless of this value.

                                          Key -> (string)
                                             A value that specifies the TagKey
                                             ,  the  name of the tag. Tag keys
                                             must be unique for  the  resource
                                             to which they are attached.

                                          Value -> (string)
                                             A  value  that specifies the Tag-

                                             corresponding tag key. Tag values
                                             can be null and don't have to  be
                                             unique in a tag set. For example,
                                             you can have a key-value pair  in
                                             a tag set of finances : April and
                                             also of payroll : April .

                                      The reason why the volume lifecycle sta-
                                      tus changed.

                                      Message -> (string)
                                          A detailed error message.

                                   OpenZFSConfiguration -> (structure)
                                      The configuration of an Amazon  FSx  for
                                      OpenZFS volume.

                                      ParentVolumeId -> (string)

                                          The path to the volume from the root
                                          volume. For example,  fsx/parentVol-
                                          ume/volume1 .

                                      StorageCapacityReservationGiB  -> (inte-
                                      ger)
                                          The amount of storage  in  gibibytes

                                          volume. You can't reserve more stor-
                                          age  than  the parent volume has re-
                                          served.

                                      StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)

                                          gibibtyes  (GiB) that the volume can
                                          use from its parent. You can specify
                                          a  quota  larger than the storage on
                                          the parent volume.

                                      RecordSizeKiB -> (integer)

                                          ume,  in kibibytes (KiB). Valid val-
                                          ues are 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128,  256,
                                          512, or 1024 KiB. The default is 128
                                          KiB. Most workloads should  use  the
                                          default record size. For guidance on
                                          when to set a  custom  record  size,

                                      DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                          Specifies the method  used  to  com-
                                          press  the  data  on the volume. The
                                          compression type is NONE by default.

                                          o NONE - Doesn't compress  the  data
                                            on  the  volume.  NONE  is the de-
                                            fault.

                                          o ZSTD - Compresses the data in  the
                                            volume  using the Zstandard (ZSTD)
                                            compression algorithm. Compared to
                                            LZ4,  Z-Standard provides a better
                                            compression  ratio   to   minimize
                                            on-disk storage utilization.

                                          o LZ4  -  Compresses the data in the
                                            volume using the  LZ4  compression
                                            algorithm. Compared to Z-Standard,
                                            LZ4 is less compute-intensive  and
                                            delivers  higher  write throughput
                                            speeds.

                                      CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                          A Boolean value  indicating  whether
                                          tags for the volume should be copied
                                          to snapshots. This value defaults to
                                          false  .  If  it's set to true , all
                                          tags for the volume  are  copied  to
                                          snapshots  where  the  user  doesn't
                                          specify tags. If this value is  true
                                          and  you  specify  one or more tags,
                                          only the specified tags  are  copied
                                          to  snapshots. If you specify one or
                                          more tags when  creating  the  snap-
                                          shot,  no  tags  are copied from the
                                          volume, regardless of this value.

                                      OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                                          The configuration object that speci-
                                          fies the snapshot to use as the ori-
                                          gin of the data for the volume.

                                          SnapshotARN -> (string)
                                             The Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)

                                             ARN when you need  to  specify  a
                                             resource unambiguously across all
                                             of Amazon Web Services. For  more

                                          CopyStrategy -> (string)
                                             The  strategy  used  when copying
                                             data from the snapshot to the new
                                             volume.

                                               snapshot. Cloning a snapshot is
                                               faster than  copying  the  data
                                               from a snapshot to a new volume

                                               snapshot can't  be  deleted  if
                                               there  is  a  volume  using its
                                               copied data.

                                             o FULL_COPY  -  Copies  all  data

                                      The lifecycle status of the snapshot.

                                      o PENDING  -  Amazon  FSx hasn't started
                                        creating the snapshot.

                                      o CREATING - Amazon FSx is creating  the
                                        snapshot.

                                      o DELETING  - Amazon FSx is deleting the
                                        snapshot.

                                      o AVAILABLE  -  The  snapshot  is  fully
                                        available.

                                   LifecycleTransitionReason -> (structure)
                                      Describes why a resource lifecycle state
                                      changed.

                                      Message -> (string)
                                          A detailed error message.

                                   Tags -> (list)
                                      A list of Tag values, with a maximum  of
                                      50 elements.

                                      (structure)
                                          Specifies a key-value pair for a re-
                                          source tag.

                                          Key -> (string)
                                             A value that specifies the TagKey
                                             ,  the  name of the tag. Tag keys
                                             must be unique for  the  resource
                                             to which they are attached.

                                          Value -> (string)
                                             A  value  that specifies the Tag-
                                             Value , the value assigned to the
                                             corresponding tag key. Tag values
                                             can be null and don't have to  be
                                             unique in a tag set. For example,
                                             you can have a key-value pair  in
                                             a tag set of finances : April and
                                             also of payroll : April .

                        OpenZFSConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The configuration of an  Amazon  FSx  for  OpenZFS
                            volume.

                            ParentVolumeId -> (string)
                               The ID of the parent volume.

                            VolumePath -> (string)
                               The  path  to  the volume from the root volume.
                               For example, fsx/parentVolume/volume1 .

                            StorageCapacityReservationGiB -> (integer)
                               The amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB) to re-
                               serve from the parent volume. You can't reserve
                               more storage than the  parent  volume  has  re-
                               served.

                            StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                               The  maximum  amount  of  storage  in gibibtyes
                               (GiB) that the volume can use from its  parent.
                               You can specify a quota larger than the storage
                               on the parent volume.

                            RecordSizeKiB -> (integer)
                               The  record  size  of  an  OpenZFS  volume,  in
                               kibibytes (KiB). Valid values are 4, 8, 16, 32,
                               64, 128, 256, 512, or 1024 KiB. The default  is
                               128  KiB. Most workloads should use the default
                               record size. For guidance on when to set a cus-
                               tom record size, see the Amazon FSx for OpenZFS
                               User Guide .

                            DataCompressionType -> (string)
                               Specifies the method used to compress the  data
                               on  the volume. The compression type is NONE by
                               default.

                               o NONE - Doesn't compress the data on the  vol-
                                 ume. NONE is the default.

                               o ZSTD  - Compresses the data in the volume us-
                                 ing the Zstandard  (ZSTD)  compression  algo-
                                 rithm. Compared to LZ4, Z-Standard provides a
                                 better compression ratio to minimize  on-disk
                                 storage utilization.

                               o LZ4 - Compresses the data in the volume using
                                 the LZ4 compression  algorithm.  Compared  to
                                 Z-Standard, LZ4 is less compute-intensive and
                                 delivers higher write throughput speeds.

                            CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                               A Boolean value indicating whether tags for the
                               volume  should  be  copied  to  snapshots. This
                               value defaults to false . If it's set to true ,
                               all tags for the volume are copied to snapshots
                               where the user doesn't specify  tags.  If  this
                               value is true and you specify one or more tags,
                               only the specified tags  are  copied  to  snap-
                               shots.  If  you  specify  one or more tags when
                               creating the snapshot, no tags are copied  from
                               the volume, regardless of this value.

                            OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                               The  configuration  object  that  specifies the
                               snapshot to use as the origin of the  data  for
                               the volume.

                               SnapshotARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a given
                                   resource. ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web
                                   Services  resources. We require an ARN when
                                   you need to specify  a  resource  unambigu-
                                   ously  across  all  of Amazon Web Services.
                                   For more information, see  Amazon  Resource
                                   Names  (ARNs)  in  the  Amazon Web Services
                                   General Reference .

                               CopyStrategy -> (string)
                                   The strategy used when  copying  data  from
                                   the snapshot to the new volume.

                                   o CLONE  -  The  new  volume references the
                                     data in the origin  snapshot.  Cloning  a
                                     snapshot  is faster than copying the data
                                     from a  snapshot  to  a  new  volume  and
                                     doesn't consume disk throughput. However,
                                     the origin snapshot can't be  deleted  if
                                     there is a volume using its copied data.

                                   o FULL_COPY  -  Copies  all  data  from the
                                     snapshot to the new volume.

                            ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                               A Boolean value indicating whether  the  volume
                               is read-only.

                            NfsExports -> (list)
                               The configuration object for mounting a Network
                               File System (NFS) file system.

                               (structure)
                                   The Network File  System  (NFS)  configura-
                                   tions  for mounting an Amazon FSx for Open-
                                   ZFS file system.

                                   ClientConfigurations -> (list)
                                      A list  of  configuration  objects  that
                                      contain   the  client  and  options  for
                                      mounting the OpenZFS file system.

                                      (structure)
                                          Specifies who can mount  an  OpenZFS
                                          file  system  and the options avail-
                                          able while mounting the file system.

                                          Clients -> (string)
                                             A value that  specifies  who  can
                                             mount  the  file  system. You can
                                             provide a wildcard  character  (*
                                             ), an IP address (0.0.0.0 ), or a
                                             CIDR address (192.0.2.0/24 ).  By
                                             default,   Amazon  FSx  uses  the
                                             wildcard character when  specify-
                                             ing the client.

                                          Options -> (list)
                                             The  options to use when mounting
                                             the file system. For  a  list  of
                                             options  that  you  can  use with
                                             Network File  System  (NFS),  see
                                             the exports(5) - Linux man page .
                                             When choosing your options,  con-
                                             sider the following:

                                             o crossmnt is used by default. If
                                               you don't specify crossmnt when
                                               changing  the client configura-
                                               tion, you won't be able to  see
                                               or  access  snapshots  in  your

                                             o sync is used by default. If you
                                               instead  specify  async  ,  the
                                               system  acknowledges writes be-
                                               fore writing to  disk.  If  the

                                               writes are finished,  you  lose
                                               the unwritten data.

                                             (string)

                                          creating a user-initiated backup, no
                                          tags are copied from the  file  sys-

                                          the  Amazon FSx file system. Aliases
                                          allow you to use existing DNS  names
                                          to  access  the  data in your Amazon
                                          FSx file system. You  can  associate
                                          up  to 50 aliases with a file system
                                          at any time. You can associate addi-
                                          tional  DNS aliases after you create

                                          A recurring daily time, in the  for-
                                          mat  HH:MM  .  HH is the zero-padded
                                          hour of the day (0-23),  and  MM  is
                                          the  zero-padded minute of the hour.
                                          For example, 05:00  specifies  5  AM
                                          daily.

                                          visioned  with  HDD storage devices.
                                          This  parameter  is  required   when
                                          StorageType is HDD. When set to READ
                                          the file system has an  SSD  storage
                                          cache  that  is  sized to 20% of the
                                          file system's storage capacity. This
                                          improves  the  performance  for fre-

                                          This  parameter  is  required   when
                                          StorageType is set to HDD.

                                          specify  tags. If this value is true
                                          and you specify one  or  more  tags,
                                          only  the  specified tags are copied
                                          to snapshots. If you specify one  or
                                          more  tags  when  creating the snap-
                                          shot, no tags are  copied  from  the
                                          volume, regardless of this value.

                                          its storage virtual  machine  (SVM).
                                          Only one volume on an SVM can be the
                                          root volume. This value defaults  to
                                          false . If this value is true , then
                                          this is the SVM root volume.

                                          This  flag  is  useful  when  you're
                                          deleting  an  SVM,  because you must
                                          first delete all  non-root  volumes.
                                          This flag, when set to false , helps
                                          you identify which volumes to delete
                                          before you can delete the SVM.

                                             SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             Specifies the tiering policy used

                                          The   volume's   universally  unique
                                          identifier (UUID).

                                      OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                                          Specifies the type of volume.  Valid
                                          values are the following:

                                          o RW  specifies a read/write volume.
                                            RW is the default.

                                          o DP  specifies  a   data-protection
                                            volume.  You  can  protect data by
                                            replicating it to  data-protection
                                            mirror  copies.  If a disaster oc-

                                          the volume. There are three built-in
                                          snapshot policies:

                                          o default : This is the default pol-
                                            icy. A maximum of six hourly snap-
                                            shots  taken five minutes past the
                                            hour. A maximum of two daily snap-
                                            shots  taken Monday through Satur-
                                            day at 10 minutes after  midnight.
                                            A  maximum of two weekly snapshots
                                            taken every Sunday at  15  minutes
                                            after midnight.

                                          o default-1weekly  :  This policy is
                                            the same as the default policy ex-
                                            cept  that  it  only  retains  one
                                            snapshot from the weekly schedule.

                                          o none : This policy does  not  take
                                            any  snapshots. This policy can be
                                            assigned to volumes to prevent au-
                                            tomatic   snapshots   from   being
                                            taken.

                                          You can also provide the name  of  a
                                          custom  policy that you created with
                                          the ONTAP CLI or REST API.

                                          A boolean  flag  indicating  whether
                                          tags for the volume should be copied
                                          to backups. This value  defaults  to
                                          false. If it's set to true, all tags
                                          for the volume are copied to all au-
                                          tomatic  and  user-initiated backups
                                          where the user doesn't specify tags.
                                          If this value is true, and you spec-
                                          ify one or more tags, only the spec-
                                          ified tags are copied to backups. If
                                          you specify one or  more  tags  when
                                          creating a user-initiated backup, no
                                          tags are copied from the volume, re-
                                          gardless of this value.

                                             unique in a tag set. For example,
                                             you  can have a key-value pair in
                                             a tag set of finances : April and

                                            algorithm. Compared to Z-Standard,
                                            LZ4  is less compute-intensive and
                                            delivers higher  write  throughput

                                      CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                          A  Boolean  value indicating whether
                                          tags for the volume should be copied
                                          to snapshots. This value defaults to
                                          false . If it's set to  true  ,  all
                                          tags  for  the  volume are copied to
                                          snapshots  where  the  user  doesn't
                                          specify  tags. If this value is true
                                          and you specify one  or  more  tags,
                                          only  the  specified tags are copied
                                          to snapshots. If you specify one  or
                                          more  tags  when  creating the snap-
                                          shot, no tags are  copied  from  the
                                          volume, regardless of this value.

                                               snapshot. Cloning a snapshot is
                                               faster  than  copying  the data
                                               from a snapshot to a new volume
