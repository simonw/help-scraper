OPTIONS
       --backup-id (string)
          The ID of the source backup. Specifies the backup that you are copy-
          ing.

       --client-request-token (string)
          (Optional)  An  idempotency token for resource creation, in a string
          of up to 64 ASCII characters. This token is automatically filled  on
          your behalf when you use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Ama-
          zon Web Services SDK.

       --name (string)
          The name of the new volume you're creating.

       --ontap-configuration (structure)
          Specifies the configuration of the ONTAP volume that you are  creat-
          ing.

          JunctionPath -> (string)
              Specifies  the  location in the SVM's namespace where the volume
              is mounted. The JunctionPath must have a leading forward  slash,
              such as /vol3 .

          SecurityStyle -> (string)
              The  security style for the volume. Specify one of the following
              values:

              o UNIX if the file system is managed by  a  UNIX  administrator,
                the  majority of users are NFS clients, and an application ac-
                cessing the data uses a UNIX user as the service account. UNIX
                is the default.

              o NTFS if the file system is managed by a Windows administrator,
                the majority of users are SMB clients, and an application  ac-
                cessing the data uses a Windows user as the service account.

              o MIXED  if  the file system is managed by both UNIX and Windows
                administrators and users consist of both NFS and SMB clients.

          SizeInMegabytes -> (integer)
              Specifies the size of the volume, in megabytes  (MB),  that  you
              are creating.

          StorageEfficiencyEnabled -> (boolean)
              Set to true to enable deduplication, compression, and compaction
              storage efficiency features on the volume.

          StorageVirtualMachineId -> (string)
              Specifies the ONTAP SVM in which to create the volume.

          TieringPolicy -> (structure)
              Describes the data tiering policy for an ONTAP volume. When  en-
              abled,  Amazon FSx for ONTAP's intelligent tiering automatically
              transitions a volume's data between the  file  system's  primary
              storage and capacity pool storage based on your access patterns.

              Valid tiering policies are the following:

              o SNAPSHOT_ONLY  -  (Default  value) moves cold snapshots to the
                capacity pool storage tier.

              o AUTO - moves cold user data and snapshots to the capacity pool
                storage tier based on your access patterns.

              o ALL  - moves all user data blocks in both the active file sys-
                tem and Snapshot copies to the storage pool tier.

              o NONE - keeps a volume's data in the primary storage tier, pre-
                venting it from being moved to the capacity pool tier.

              CoolingPeriod -> (integer)
                 Specifies  the number of days that user data in a volume must
                 remain inactive before it is considered "cold" and  moved  to
                 the capacity pool. Used with the AUTO and SNAPSHOT_ONLY tier-
                 ing policies. Enter a whole number between 2 and 183. Default
                 values are 31 days for AUTO and 2 days for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

              Name -> (string)
                 Specifies the tiering policy used to transition data. Default
                 value is SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                 o SNAPSHOT_ONLY - moves cold snapshots to the  capacity  pool
                   storage tier.

                 o AUTO  -  moves cold user data and snapshots to the capacity
                   pool storage tier based on your access patterns.

                 o ALL - moves all user data blocks in both  the  active  file
                   system and Snapshot copies to the storage pool tier.

                 o NONE  -  keeps a volume's data in the primary storage tier,
                   preventing it from being moved to the capacity pool tier.

       --tags (list)
          A list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

          (structure)
              Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 A value that specifies the TagKey , the name of the tag.  Tag
                 keys  must  be  unique for the resource to which they are at-
                 tached.

              Value -> (string)
                 A value that specifies the TagValue , the value  assigned  to
                 the  corresponding  tag key. Tag values can be null and don't
                 have to be unique in a tag set. For example, you can  have  a
                 key-value  pair  in a tag set of finances : April and also of
                 payroll : April .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

              o PENDING - Amazon FSx hasn't started creating the volume.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the volume.

          OntapConfiguration -> (structure)
              The configuration of an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP volume.

              FlexCacheEndpointType -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  FlexCache  endpoint type of the volume. Valid
                 values are the following:

                 o NONE specifies that the volume  doesn't  have  a  FlexCache
                   configuration. NONE is the default.

                 o ORIGIN specifies that the volume is the origin volume for a
                   FlexCache volume.

                 o CACHE specifies that the volume is a FlexCache volume.

              JunctionPath -> (string)
                 Specifies the directory that network-attached  storage  (NAS)
                 clients  use to mount the volume, along with the storage vir-
                 tual machine (SVM) Domain Name System (DNS) name  or  IP  ad-
                 dress.  You can create a JunctionPath directly below a parent
                 volume junction or on a directory within a  volume.  A  Junc-
                 tionPath  for  a volume named vol3 might be /vol1/vol2/vol3 ,
                 or /vol1/dir2/vol3 , or even /dir1/dir2/vol3 .

              SecurityStyle -> (string)

                 The volume's storage efficiency setting.

              StorageVirtualMachineId -> (string)
                 The ID of the volume's storage virtual machine.

              StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                 A  Boolean  flag  indicating  whether this volume is the root
                 volume for its storage virtual machine (SVM). Only one volume
                 on  an  SVM  can  be  the root volume. This value defaults to
                 false . If this value is true , then this  is  the  SVM  root
                 volume.

                 This  flag is useful when you're deleting an SVM, because you
                 must first delete all non-root volumes. This flag,  when  set
                 to  false , helps you identify which volumes to delete before
                 you can delete the SVM.

              TieringPolicy -> (structure)
                 The volume's TieringPolicy setting.

                 CoolingPeriod -> (integer)
                     Specifies the number of days that user data in  a  volume
                     must  remain  inactive before it is considered "cold" and
                     moved to the capacity pool. Used with the AUTO and  SNAP-
                     SHOT_ONLY  tiering policies. Enter a whole number between
                     2 and 183. Default values are 31 days for AUTO and 2 days
                     for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                 Name -> (string)
                     Specifies the tiering policy used to transition data. De-
                     fault value is SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                     o SNAPSHOT_ONLY - moves cold snapshots  to  the  capacity
                       pool storage tier.

                     o AUTO - moves cold user data and snapshots to the capac-
                       ity pool storage tier based on your access patterns.

                     o ALL - moves all user data blocks  in  both  the  active
                       file  system  and  Snapshot  copies to the storage pool
                       tier.

                     o NONE - keeps a volume's data  in  the  primary  storage
                       tier,  preventing  it  from being moved to the capacity
                       pool tier.

              UUID -> (string)
                 The volume's universally unique identifier (UUID).

              OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                 Specifies the type of volume. Valid values are the following:

                 o RW specifies a read/write volume. RW is the default.

                 o DP specifies a data-protection volume. You can protect data
                   by  replicating  it  to data-protection mirror copies. If a
                   disaster occurs, you can use these  data-protection  mirror
                   copies to recover data.

                 o LS  specifies  a load-sharing mirror volume. A load-sharing
                   mirror reduces the network traffic to a FlexVol  volume  by
                   providing additional read-only access to clients.

          ResourceARN -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  for  a  given resource. ARNs
              uniquely identify Amazon Web Services resources. We  require  an
              ARN when you need to specify a resource unambiguously across all
              of Amazon Web Services. For more  information,  see  Amazon  Re-
              source Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference
              .

          Tags -> (list)
              A list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

              (structure)
                 Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

                 Key -> (string)
                     A value that specifies the TagKey , the name of the  tag.
                     Tag  keys  must  be unique for the resource to which they
                     are attached.

                 Value -> (string)
                     A value that specifies the TagValue , the value  assigned
                     to  the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null and
                     don't have to be unique in a tag set.  For  example,  you
                     can  have  a  key-value  pair  in a tag set of finances :
                     April and also of payroll : April .

          VolumeId -> (string)
              The system-generated, unique ID of the volume.

          VolumeType -> (string)
              The type of the volume.

          LifecycleTransitionReason -> (structure)
              The reason why the volume lifecycle status changed.

              Message -> (string)
                 A detailed error message.

          AdministrativeActions -> (list)
              A list of administrative actions for the file system that are in
              process  or  waiting to be processed. Administrative actions de-
              scribe changes to the Amazon FSx system that you initiated.

              (structure)
                 Describes a specific Amazon FSx administrative action for the
                 current Windows, Lustre, or OpenZFS file system.

                 AdministrativeActionType -> (string)
                     Describes the type of administrative action, as follows:

                     o FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE  -  A file system update administra-
                       tive action initiated from the Amazon FSx console,  API
                       (UpdateFileSystem ), or CLI (update-file-system ).

                     o STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION  -  After  the  FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE
                       task to increase a file system's storage  capacity  has
                       been  completed  successfully,  a  STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION
                       task starts.

                       o For Windows and ONTAP, storage  optimization  is  the
                         process  of  migrating  the file system data to newer
                         larger disks.

                       o For Lustre, storage optimization consists  of  rebal-
                         ancing  the  data across the existing and newly added
                         file servers.

                     You can track the storage-optimization progress using the
                     ProgressPercent  property.  When STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION has
                     been completed successfully, the  parent  FILE_SYSTEM_UP-
                     DATE action status changes to COMPLETED . For more infor-

                     IOPS in the Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP User Guide .

                     o FILE_SYSTEM_ALIAS_ASSOCIATION - A file system update to
                       associate a new Domain Name System (DNS) alias with the
                       file    system.    For    more     information,     see
                       AssociateFileSystemAliases .

                     o FILE_SYSTEM_ALIAS_DISASSOCIATION - A file system update
                       to disassociate a DNS alias from the file  system.  For
                       more information, see DisassociateFileSystemAliases .

                     o VOLUME_UPDATE  -  A  volume update to an Amazon FSx for
                       NetApp ONTAP or Amazon FSx for OpenZFS volume initiated
                       from  the  Amazon  FSx console, API (UpdateVolume ), or
                       CLI (update-volume ).

                     o SNAPSHOT_UPDATE - A snapshot update to  an  Amazon  FSx
                       for  OpenZFS  volume initiated from the Amazon FSx con-
                       sole, API (UpdateSnapshot ), or CLI (update-snapshot ).

                            Use  this IP address when mounting the file system
                            on Linux SMB clients or Windows SMB  clients  that
                            are  not  joined  to a Microsoft Active Directory.
                            Applicable for all Windows file system  deployment
                            types.  This IP address is temporarily unavailable
                            when the file system  is  undergoing  maintenance.
                            For  Linux and Windows SMB clients that are joined
                            to an Active  Directory,  use  the  file  system's
                            DNSName  instead.  For more information on mapping
                            and  mounting  file  shares,  see  Accessing  File
                            Shares .

                        ThroughputCapacity -> (integer)
                            The throughput of the Amazon FSx file system, mea-
                            sured in megabytes per second.

                        MaintenanceOperationsInProgress -> (list)
                            The list of maintenance operations in progress for
                            this file system.

                            (string)
                               An enumeration specifying the currently ongoing
                               maintenance operation.

                        WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime -> (string)
                            The preferred start time to perform weekly mainte-
                            nance,  formatted  d:HH:MM in the UTC time zone. d
                            is the weekday number, from 1 through 7, beginning
                            with Monday and ending with Sunday.

                        DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                            The  preferred  time to take daily automatic back-
                            ups, in the UTC time zone.

                        AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                            The number of days to  retain  automatic  backups.
                            Setting  this to 0 disables automatic backups. You
                            can retain automatic backups for a maximum  of  90
                            days.

                        CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                            A boolean flag indicating whether tags on the file
                            system should be copied to backups. This value de-
                            faults  to false. If it's set to true, all tags on
                            the file system are copied to all automatic  back-
                            ups  and any user-initiated backups where the user
                            doesn't specify any tags. If this value  is  true,
                            and  you specify one or more tags, only the speci-
                            fied tags are copied to backups.  If  you  specify
                            one  or  more  tags when creating a user-initiated
                            backup, no tags are copied from the  file  system,
                            regardless of this value.

                        Aliases -> (list)
                            An  array of one or more DNS aliases that are cur-
                            rently associated with the Amazon FSx file system.
                            Aliases allow you to use existing DNS names to ac-
                            cess the data in your Amazon FSx file system.  You
                            can  associate up to 50 aliases with a file system
                            at any time.  You  can  associate  additional  DNS
                            aliases after you create the file system using the
                            AssociateFileSystemAliases operation. You can  re-
                            move  DNS aliases from the file system after it is
                            created  using  the  DisassociateFileSystemAliases
                            operation. You only need to specify the alias name
                            in the request payload. For more information,  see
                            DNS aliases .

                            (structure)
                               A  DNS  alias  that is associated with the file
                               system. You can use a DNS  alias  to  access  a
                               file  system  using  user-defined DNS names, in
                               addition to the default DNS  name  that  Amazon
                               FSx assigns to the file system. For more infor-
                               mation, see DNS aliases in the FSx for  Windows
                               File Server User Guide .

                                   The  name  of the DNS alias. The alias name
                                   has to meet the following requirements:

                                   o Formatted  as  a  fully-qualified  domain
                                     name  (FQDN), hostname.domain , for exam-
                                     ple, accounting.example.com .

                                   o Can contain alphanumeric characters,  the
                                     underscore (_), and the hyphen (-).

                                   o Cannot start or end with a hyphen.

                                   o Can start with a numeric.

                                   For DNS names, Amazon FSx stores alphabetic
                                   characters as lowercase letters (a-z),  re-
                                   gardless of how you specify them: as upper-
                                   case letters,  lowercase  letters,  or  the
                                   corresponding letters in escape codes.

                               Lifecycle -> (string)
                                   Describes the state of the DNS alias.

                                   o AVAILABLE  -  The DNS alias is associated
                                     with an Amazon FSx file system.

                                   o CREATING - Amazon FSx is creating the DNS
                                     alias  and  associating  it with the file
                                     system.

                                   o CREATE_FAILED - Amazon FSx was unable  to
                                     associate  the  DNS  alias  with the file
                                     system.

                                   o DELETING - Amazon FSx  is  disassociating
                                     the  DNS  alias  from the file system and
                                     deleting it.

                                   o DELETE_FAILED - Amazon FSx was unable  to
                                     disassociate  the DNS alias from the file
                                     system.

                        AuditLogConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The configuration that Amazon FSx for Windows File

                               repository for your FSx for Lustre file system,
                               for example  s3://import-bucket/optional-prefix
                               .  If a prefix is specified after the Amazon S3
                               bucket name, only object keys with that  prefix
                               are loaded into the file system.

                            ExportPath -> (string)
                               The  export  path  to the Amazon S3 bucket (and
                               prefix) that you are using  to  store  new  and
                               changed Lustre file system files in S3.

                            ImportedFileChunkSize -> (integer)

                               value determines the stripe count  and  maximum
                               amount  of  data  per file (in MiB) stored on a
                               single physical disk.  The  maximum  number  of
                               disks  that a single file can be striped across
                               is limited by the total number  of  disks  that
                               make up the file system.

                               The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and
                               can go as high as 512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon
                               S3 objects have a maximum size of 5 TB.

                            AutoImportPolicy -> (string)
                               Describes  the  file  system's  linked  S3 data
                               repository's AutoImportPolicy . The AutoImport-
                               Policy  configures  how  Amazon  FSx keeps your
                               file and directory listings up to date  as  you
                               add or modify objects in your linked S3 bucket.
                               AutoImportPolicy can have the following values:

                               o NONE - (Default) AutoImport  is  off.  Amazon
                                 FSx  only updates file and directory listings
                                 from the linked S3 bucket when the file  sys-
                                 tem  is created. FSx does not update file and
                                 directory listings for any new or changed ob-
                                 jects after choosing this option.

                               o NEW  - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx automati-
                                 cally imports directory listings of  any  new
                                 objects added to the linked S3 bucket that do
                                 not currently exist in the FSx file system.

                               o NEW_CHANGED - AutoImport is  on.  Amazon  FSx
                                 automatically   imports  file  and  directory
                                 listings of any new objects added to  the  S3
                                 bucket  and  any  existing  objects  that are
                                 changed in the S3  bucket  after  you  choose
                                 this option.

                               o NEW_CHANGED_DELETED  - AutoImport is on. Ama-
                                 zon FSx automatically imports file and direc-
                                 tory listings of any new objects added to the
                                 S3 bucket,  any  existing  objects  that  are
                                 changed  in  the  S3  bucket, and any objects
                                 that were deleted in the S3 bucket.

                            FailureDetails -> (structure)
                               Provides detailed information  about  the  data
                               respository  if its Lifecycle is set to MISCON-
                               FIGURED or FAILED .

                               Message -> (string)
                                   A detailed error message.

                        DeploymentType -> (string)
                            The deployment type of the  FSx  for  Lustre  file
                            system.  Scratch  deployment  type is designed for
                            temporary storage and shorter-term  processing  of
                            data.
                               SCRATCH_1  and  SCRATCH_2  deployment types are
                               best suited for when you need temporary storage
                               and   shorter-term   processing  of  data.  The
                               SCRATCH_2 deployment type  provides  in-transit
                               encryption  of data and higher burst throughput
                               capacity than SCRATCH_1 .

                            The PERSISTENT_1 and PERSISTENT_2 deployment  type
                            is  used for longer-term storage and workloads and
                            encryption of data  in  transit.  PERSISTENT_2  is
                            built  on  Lustre v2.12 and offers higher PerUnit-
                            StorageThroughput (up to 1000 MB/s/TiB) along with
                            a  lower minimum storage capacity requirement (600
                            GiB). To learn more about FSx for  Lustre  deploy-
                            ment  types, see FSx for Lustre deployment options
                            .

                            The default is SCRATCH_1 .

                        PerUnitStorageThroughput -> (integer)
                            Per  unit  storage   throughput   represents   the
                            megabytes  per  second of read or write throughput
                            per 1 tebibyte of storage provisioned. File system
                            throughput  capacity  is equal to Storage capacity
                            (TiB) * PerUnitStorageThroughput (MB/s/TiB).  This
                            option  is only valid for PERSISTENT_1 and PERSIS-
                            TENT_2 deployment types.

                            Valid values:

                            o For PERSISTENT_1 SSD storage: 50, 100, 200.

                            o For PERSISTENT_1 HDD storage: 12, 40.

                            o For PERSISTENT_2 SSD  storage:  125,  250,  500,
                              1000.

                        MountName -> (string)
                            You use the MountName value when mounting the file
                            system.

                            For the SCRATCH_1 deployment type, this  value  is
                            always  "fsx ". For SCRATCH_2 , PERSISTENT_1 , and
                            PERSISTENT_2 deployment types,  this  value  is  a
                            string  that  is  unique within an Amazon Web Ser-
                            vices Region.

                        DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                            A recurring daily time, in the format HH:MM  .  HH
                            is  the zero-padded hour of the day (0-23), and MM
                            is the zero-padded minute of the hour.  For  exam-
                            ple, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                        AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                            The  number  of  days to retain automatic backups.
                            Setting this  property  to  0  disables  automatic
                            backups.  You  can  retain automatic backups for a
                            maximum of 90 days. The default is 0 .

                        CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                            A boolean flag indicating whether tags on the file
                            system are copied to backups. If it's set to true,
                            all tags on the file system are copied to all  au-
                            tomatic  backups  and  any  user-initiated backups
                            where the user doesn't specify any tags.  If  this
                            value  is  true, and you specify one or more tags,
                            only the specified tags are copied to backups.  If
                            you  specify  one  or  more  tags  when creating a
                            user-initiated backup, no tags are copied from the
                            file  system, regardless of this value. (Default =
                            false)

                        DriveCacheType -> (string)
                            The type of drive cache used by PERSISTENT_1  file
                            systems  that are provisioned with HDD storage de-
                            vices. This parameter is required when StorageType
                            is  HDD.  When  set to READ the file system has an
                            SSD storage cache that is sized to 20% of the file
                            system's  storage capacity. This improves the per-
                            formance for frequently accessed files by  caching
                            up to 20% of the total storage capacity.

                            This parameter is required when StorageType is set
                            to HDD.

                        DataCompressionType -> (string)
                            The data compression configuration  for  the  file
                            system. DataCompressionType can have the following
                            values:

                            o NONE - Data compression is turned  off  for  the
                              file system.

                            o LZ4 - Data compression is turned on with the LZ4
                              algorithm.

                            For more information, see Lustre data  compression
                            .

                        LogConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The  Lustre  logging configuration. Lustre logging
                            writes the enabled log events for your file system
                            to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

                            Level -> (string)
                               The  data  repository events that are logged by
                               Amazon FSx.

                               o WARN_ONLY - only warning events are logged.

                               o ERROR_ONLY - only error events are logged.

                               o WARN_ERROR - both warning  events  and  error
                                 events are logged.

                               o DISABLED  - logging of data repository events
                                 is turned off.

                            Destination -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  that  specifies
                               the  destination  of  the logs. The destination
                               can be any Amazon  CloudWatch  Logs  log  group
                               ARN.  The  destination  ARN must be in the same
                               Amazon Web Services partition, Amazon Web  Ser-
                               vices  Region,  and Amazon Web Services account
                               as your Amazon FSx file system.

                     AdministrativeActions -> (list)
                        A list of administrative actions for the  file  system
                        that are in process or waiting to be processed. Admin-
                        istrative actions describe changes to the  Amazon  FSx
                        system  that  you  have  initiated  using  the Update-
                        FileSystem operation.

                        (structure)
                            Describes a specific Amazon FSx administrative ac-
                            tion  for  the current Windows, Lustre, or OpenZFS
                            file system.

                            AdministrativeActionType -> (string)
                               Describes the type of administrative action, as
                               follows:

                               o FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE - A file system update ad-
                                 ministrative action initiated from the Amazon
                                 FSx  console, API (UpdateFileSystem ), or CLI
                                 (update-file-system ).

                               o STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION -  After  the  FILE_SYS-
                                 TEM_UPDATE  task  to increase a file system's
                                 storage capacity has been completed  success-
                                 fully, a STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION task starts.

                                 o For Windows and ONTAP, storage optimization
                                   is the process of migrating the file system
                                   data to newer larger disks.

                                 o For  Lustre,  storage optimization consists
                                   of rebalancing the data across the existing
                                   and newly added file servers.

                               You can track the storage-optimization progress
                               using the ProgressPercent property. When  STOR-
                               AGE_OPTIMIZATION  has  been  completed success-
                               fully,  the  parent  FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE  action
                               status changes to COMPLETED . For more informa-

                                   file system deployment type, there are  two
                                   subnet  IDs,  one  for  the  preferred file
                                   server and one for the standby file server.
                                   The preferred file server subnet identified
                                   in  the  PreferredSubnetID  property.   All
                                   other file systems have only one subnet ID.

                                   of  the  subnet that contains the file sys-
                                   tem's endpoint. For MULTI_AZ_1 Windows  and
                                   ONTAP  file  systems,  the file system end-
                                   point is available in the PreferredSubnetID
                                   .

                                   (string)

                                   sible. The elastic network interface is au-
                                   tomatically created  in  the  same  virtual
                                   private  cloud  (VPC)  that  the Amazon FSx
                                   file system was created in. For more infor-

                                      FSx  file  system.  Aliases allow you to
                                      use existing DNS  names  to  access  the
                                      data in your Amazon FSx file system. You
                                      can associate up to 50  aliases  with  a
                                      file  system  at any time. You can asso-
                                      ciate additional DNS aliases  after  you
                                      create the file system using the Associ-
                                      ateFileSystemAliases operation. You  can
                                      remove  DNS aliases from the file system
                                      after it is created using the Disassoci-

                                      need to specify the alias  name  in  the
                                      request  payload.  For more information,

                                          repository,  this  value  determines
                                          the  stripe count and maximum amount
                                          of data per file (in MiB) stored  on
                                          a  single physical disk. The maximum
                                          number of disks that a  single  file
                                          can  be striped across is limited by
                                          the total number of disks that  make
                                          up the file system.

                                          The  default chunk size is 1,024 MiB

                                      tre file system. Scratch deployment type
                                      is  designed  for  temporary storage and
                                      shorter-term processing of data.
                                          SCRATCH_1 and  SCRATCH_2  deployment
                                          types  are  best suited for when you
                                          need    temporary    storage     and
                                          shorter-term processing of data. The
                                          SCRATCH_2 deployment  type  provides
                                          in-transit  encryption  of  data and
                                          higher  burst  throughput   capacity
                                          than SCRATCH_1 .

                                      The  PERSISTENT_1  and  PERSISTENT_2 de-
                                      ployment type is  used  for  longer-term
                                      storage  and workloads and encryption of
                                      data in transit. PERSISTENT_2  is  built
                                      on  Lustre  v2.12  and offers higher Pe-
                                      rUnitStorageThroughput   (up   to   1000
                                      MB/s/TiB)  along  with  a  lower minimum
                                      storage capacity requirement (600  GiB).

                                      ing the file system.

                                      For the SCRATCH_1 deployment type,  this
                                      value  is always "fsx ". For SCRATCH_2 ,
                                      PERSISTENT_1 , and PERSISTENT_2  deploy-
                                      ment  types, this value is a string that
                                      is unique within an Amazon Web  Services
                                      Region.

                                   DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                                      A  recurring  daily  time, in the format
                                      HH:MM . HH is the  zero-padded  hour  of
                                      the   day   (0-23),   and   MM   is  the
                                      zero-padded minute of the hour. For  ex-
                                      ample, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                                   AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                                      The  number  of days to retain automatic
                                      backups. Setting this property to 0 dis-
                                      ables  automatic backups. You can retain
                                      automatic backups for a  maximum  of  90
                                      days. The default is 0 .

                                   CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                      A  boolean  flag indicating whether tags
                                      on the file system are copied  to  back-
                                      ups.  If  it's  set to true, all tags on
                                      the file system are copied to all  auto-
                                      matic  backups  and  any  user-initiated
                                      backups where the user  doesn't  specify
                                      any tags. If this value is true, and you
                                      specify one or more tags, only the spec-
                                      ified tags are copied to backups. If you
                                      specify one or more tags when creating a
                                      user-initiated   backup,   no  tags  are
                                      copied from the file system,  regardless
                                      of this value. (Default = false)

                                   DriveCacheType -> (string)
                                      The  type of drive cache used by PERSIS-
                                      TENT_1 file systems that are provisioned
                                      with HDD storage devices. This parameter
                                      is required  when  StorageType  is  HDD.
                                      When  set to READ the file system has an
                                      SSD storage cache that is sized  to  20%
                                      of  the  file system's storage capacity.
                                      This improves the performance  for  fre-
                                      quently  accessed files by caching up to
                                      20% of the total storage capacity.

                                      This parameter is  required  when  Stor-
                                      ageType is set to HDD.

                                   DataCompressionType -> (string)

                                      any tags. If this value is true and  you
                                      specify one or more tags, only the spec-
                                      ified tags are copied to backups. If you
                                      specify one or more tags when creating a
                                      user-initiated  backup,  no   tags   are

                                      shots. This value defaults to false . If
                                      it's set to true , all tags for the vol-
                                      ume are copied to  snapshots  where  the
                                      user doesn't specify tags. If this value
                                      is true and  you  specify  one  or  more
                                      tags, only the specified tags are copied
                                      to snapshots. If you specify one or more
                                      tags when creating the snapshot, no tags
                                      are copied from the  volume,  regardless
                                      of this value.

                                      A Boolean flag indicating  whether  this
                                      volume  is the root volume for its stor-
                                      age virtual machine (SVM). Only one vol-
                                      ume  on  an  SVM can be the root volume.
                                      This value defaults to false .  If  this
                                      value  is  true  ,  then this is the SVM
                                      root volume.

                                      This flag is useful when you're deleting
                                      an  SVM,  because  you must first delete
                                      all non-root volumes.  This  flag,  when
                                      set  to false , helps you identify which
                                      volumes to delete before you can  delete
                                      the SVM.

                                          inactive  before  it  is  considered
                                          "cold" and  moved  to  the  capacity
                                          pool.  Used  with the AUTO and SNAP-

                                          transition data.  Default  value  is
                                          SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                          o SNAPSHOT_ONLY  -  moves cold snap-
                                            shots to the capacity pool storage
                                            tier.

                                          o AUTO  -  moves  cold user data and
                                            snapshots  to  the  capacity  pool
                                            storage  tier based on your access
                                            patterns.

                                          o ALL - moves all user  data  blocks
                                            in both the active file system and
                                            Snapshot  copies  to  the  storage
                                            pool tier.

                                          o NONE  -  keeps  a volume's data in
                                            the primary storage tier, prevent-
                                            ing it from being moved to the ca-
                                            pacity pool tier.

                                   UUID -> (string)
                                      The volume's universally unique  identi-
                                      fier (UUID).

                                   OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                                      Specifies the type of volume. Valid val-
                                      ues are the following:

                                      o RW specifies a read/write  volume.  RW
                                        is the default.

                                      o DP specifies a data-protection volume.
                                        You can protect data by replicating it
                                        to data-protection mirror copies. If a
                                        disaster occurs,  you  can  use  these
                                        data-protection  mirror  copies to re-
                                        cover data.

                                      o LS  specifies  a  load-sharing  mirror
                                        volume.  A load-sharing mirror reduces
                                        the network traffic to a FlexVol  vol-
                                        ume  by providing additional read-only
                                        access to clients.

                               ResourceARN -> (string)

                                   resource. ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web
                                   Services resources. We require an ARN  when
                                   you  need  to  specify a resource unambigu-
                                   ously across all of  Amazon  Web  Services.
                                   For  more  information, see Amazon Resource

                               Tags -> (list)
                                   A  list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50
                                   elements.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies a key-value  pair  for  a  re-
                                      source tag.

                                      Key -> (string)
                                          A  value that specifies the TagKey ,
                                          the name of the tag. Tag  keys  must
                                          be  unique for the resource to which
                                          they are attached.

                                      Value -> (string)
                                          A value that specifies the  TagValue
                                          ,  the  value assigned to the corre-
                                          sponding tag key. Tag values can  be
                                          null  and don't have to be unique in
                                          a tag set. For example, you can have
                                          a key-value pair in a tag set of fi-
                                          nances : April and also of payroll :
                                          April .

                               VolumeId -> (string)

                                   The reason why the volume lifecycle  status
                                   changed.

                                   Message -> (string)
                                      A detailed error message.

                                      volume.   For   example,  fsx/parentVol-
                                      ume/volume1 .

                                   StorageCapacityReservationGiB -> (integer)
                                      The amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB)
                                      to  reserve  from the parent volume. You
                                      can't reserve more storage than the par-
                                      ent volume has reserved.

                                   StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                                      The  maximum amount of storage in gibib-
                                      tyes (GiB) that the volume can use  from
                                      its  parent.  You  can  specify  a quota
                                      larger than the storage  on  the  parent
                                      volume.

                                   RecordSizeKiB -> (integer)
                                      The record size of an OpenZFS volume, in
                                      kibibytes (KiB). Valid values are 4,  8,
                                      16,  32, 64, 128, 256, 512, or 1024 KiB.
                                      The default is 128 KiB.  Most  workloads
                                      should  use the default record size. For
                                      guidance on when to set a custom  record
                                      size,  see  the  Amazon  FSx for OpenZFS

                                   DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                      Specifies the method  used  to  compress
                                      the  data on the volume. The compression
                                      type is NONE by default.

                                      o NONE - Doesn't compress  the  data  on
                                        the volume. NONE is the default.

                                      o ZSTD - Compresses the data in the vol-
                                        ume using the  Zstandard  (ZSTD)  com-
                                        pression  algorithm.  Compared to LZ4,
                                        Z-Standard provides a better  compres-
                                        sion ratio to minimize on-disk storage
                                        utilization.

                                      o LZ4 - Compresses the data in the  vol-
                                        ume  using  the  LZ4 compression algo-
                                        rithm. Compared to Z-Standard, LZ4  is
                                        less  compute-intensive  and  delivers
                                        higher write throughput speeds.

                                   CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                      A Boolean value indicating whether  tags
                                      for the volume should be copied to snap-
                                      shots. This value defaults to false . If
                                      it's set to true , all tags for the vol-
                                      ume are copied to  snapshots  where  the
                                      user doesn't specify tags. If this value
                                      is true and  you  specify  one  or  more
                                      tags, only the specified tags are copied
                                      to snapshots. If you specify one or more
                                      tags when creating the snapshot, no tags
                                      are copied from the  volume,  regardless
                                      of this value.

                                   OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                                      The  configuration object that specifies
                                      the snapshot to use as the origin of the
                                      data for the volume.

                                      SnapshotARN -> (string)
                                          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a
                                          given resource. ARNs uniquely  iden-
                                          tify  Amazon Web Services resources.
                                          We require an ARN when you  need  to
                                          specify   a  resource  unambiguously
                                          across all of Amazon  Web  Services.
                                          For more information, see Amazon Re-
                                          source Names (ARNs)  in  the  Amazon
                                          Web Services General Reference .

                                      CopyStrategy -> (string)
                                          The  strategy used when copying data
                                          from the snapshot to the new volume.

                                          o CLONE - The new volume  references
                                            the  data  in the origin snapshot.
                                            Cloning a snapshot is faster  than
                                            copying  the  data from a snapshot
                                            to a new volume and  doesn't  con-
                                            sume disk throughput. However, the
                                            origin snapshot can't  be  deleted
                                            if  there  is  a  volume using its
                                            copied data.

                            user doesn't specify tags. If this value  is  true
                            and  you specify one or more tags, only the speci-
                            fied tags are copied to snapshots. If you  specify
                            one  or  more  tags when creating the snapshot, no
                            tags are copied from  the  volume,  regardless  of
                            this value.

                            value is true , then this is the SVM root volume.

                            This flag is useful when you're deleting  an  SVM,
                            because  you  must  first delete all non-root vol-
                            umes. This flag, when set to  false  ,  helps  you
                            identify  which  volumes  to delete before you can
                            delete the SVM.

                        TieringPolicy -> (structure)
                            The volume's TieringPolicy setting.

                            CoolingPeriod -> (integer)
                               Specifies the number of days that user data  in
                               a volume must remain inactive before it is con-
                               sidered "cold" and moved to the capacity  pool.
                               Used  with  the  AUTO and SNAPSHOT_ONLY tiering
                               policies. Enter a whole number  between  2  and
                               183.  Default values are 31 days for AUTO and 2
                               days for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                            Name -> (string)
                               Specifies the tiering policy used to transition
                               data. Default value is SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                               o SNAPSHOT_ONLY  -  moves cold snapshots to the
                                 capacity pool storage tier.

                               o AUTO - moves cold user data and snapshots  to
                                 the  capacity pool storage tier based on your
                                 access patterns.

                               o ALL - moves all user data blocks in both  the
                                 active file system and Snapshot copies to the
                                 storage pool tier.

                               o NONE - keeps a volume's data in  the  primary
                                 storage  tier, preventing it from being moved
                                 to the capacity pool tier.

                        UUID -> (string)
                            The volume's universally unique identifier (UUID).

                            Specifies the type of volume. Valid values are the
                            following:

                            o RW  specifies a read/write volume. RW is the de-
                              fault.

                            o DP specifies a data-protection volume.  You  can
                              protect  data  by replicating it to data-protec-
                              tion mirror copies. If a  disaster  occurs,  you
                              can  use  these data-protection mirror copies to
                              recover data.

                            o LS specifies a  load-sharing  mirror  volume.  A
                              load-sharing  mirror reduces the network traffic
                              to a  FlexVol  volume  by  providing  additional
                              read-only access to clients.

                     ResourceARN -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) for a given resource.
                        ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web Services  resources.
                        We  require an ARN when you need to specify a resource
                        unambiguously across all of Amazon Web  Services.  For
                        more  information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
                        the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

                     Tags -> (list)
                        A list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

                               the  tag.  Tag  keys must be unique for the re-
                               source to which they are attached.

                            Value -> (string)
                               A value that specifies the TagValue , the value
                               assigned to the corresponding tag key. Tag val-
                               ues can be null and don't have to be unique  in
                               a   tag  set.  For  example,  you  can  have  a
                               key-value pair in a tag set of finances : April
                               and also of payroll : April .

                                 FSx  console, API (UpdateFileSystem ), or CLI
                                 (update-file-system ).

                               o STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION -  After  the  FILE_SYS-
                                 TEM_UPDATE  task  to increase a file system's
                                 storage capacity has been completed  success-
                                 fully, a STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION task starts.

                                 o For Windows and ONTAP, storage optimization
                                   is the process of migrating the file system
                                   data to newer larger disks.

                                 o For  Lustre,  storage optimization consists
                                   of rebalancing the data across the existing
                                   and newly added file servers.

                               You can track the storage-optimization progress
                               using the ProgressPercent property. When  STOR-
                               AGE_OPTIMIZATION  has  been  completed success-
                               fully,  the  parent  FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE  action
                               status changes to COMPLETED . For more informa-

                                      FSx  file  system.  Aliases allow you to
                                      use existing DNS  names  to  access  the
                                      data in your Amazon FSx file system. You
                                      can associate up to 50  aliases  with  a
                                      file  system  at any time. You can asso-
                                      ciate additional DNS aliases  after  you
                                      create the file system using the Associ-
                                      ateFileSystemAliases operation. You  can
                                      remove  DNS aliases from the file system
                                      after it is created using the Disassoci-

                                      need to specify the alias  name  in  the
                                      request  payload.  For more information,

                                   DeploymentType -> (string)
                                      The  deployment type of the FSx for Lus-
                                      tre file system. Scratch deployment type
                                      is  designed  for  temporary storage and
                                      shorter-term processing of data.
                                          SCRATCH_1 and  SCRATCH_2  deployment
                                          types  are  best suited for when you
                                          need    temporary    storage     and
                                          shorter-term processing of data. The
                                          SCRATCH_2 deployment  type  provides
                                          in-transit  encryption  of  data and
                                          higher  burst  throughput   capacity
                                          than SCRATCH_1 .

                                      HH:MM . HH is the  zero-padded  hour  of
                                      the   day   (0-23),   and   MM   is  the
                                      zero-padded minute of the hour. For  ex-
                                      ample, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                                   AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                                      The  number  of days to retain automatic
                                      backups. Setting this property to 0 dis-
                                      ables  automatic backups. You can retain
                                      automatic backups for a  maximum  of  90
                                      days. The default is 0 .

                                   CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                      A  boolean  flag indicating whether tags
                                      on the file system are copied  to  back-
                                      ups.  If  it's  set to true, all tags on
                                      the file system are copied to all  auto-
                                      matic  backups  and  any  user-initiated
                                      backups where the user  doesn't  specify
                                      any tags. If this value is true, and you
                                      specify one or more tags, only the spec-
                                      ified tags are copied to backups. If you
                                      specify one or more tags when creating a
                                      user-initiated   backup,   no  tags  are
                                      copied from the file system,  regardless
                                      of this value. (Default = false)

                                   DriveCacheType -> (string)
                                      The  type of drive cache used by PERSIS-

                                      with HDD storage devices. This parameter
                                      is required  when  StorageType  is  HDD.
                                      When  set to READ the file system has an
                                      SSD storage cache that is sized  to  20%
                                      of  the  file system's storage capacity.
                                      This improves the performance  for  fre-
                                      quently  accessed files by caching up to
                                      20% of the total storage capacity.

                                      This parameter is  required  when  Stor-
                                      ageType is set to HDD.

                                      source tag.

                                      Key -> (string)
                                          A  value that specifies the TagKey ,
                                          the name of the tag. Tag  keys  must
                                          be  unique for the resource to which
                                          they are attached.

                                      Value -> (string)
                                          A value that specifies the  TagValue
                                          ,  the  value assigned to the corre-
                                          sponding tag key. Tag values can  be
                                          null  and don't have to be unique in
                                          a tag set. For example, you can have

                        VolumePath -> (string)
                            The  path  to the volume from the root volume. For
                            example, fsx/parentVolume/volume1 .

                        StorageCapacityReservationGiB -> (integer)
                            The amount of storage in gibibytes  (GiB)  to  re-
                            serve  from  the  parent volume. You can't reserve
                            more storage than the parent volume has reserved.

                        StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                            The maximum amount of storage in  gibibtyes  (GiB)
                            that  the  volume can use from its parent. You can
                            specify a quota larger than  the  storage  on  the
                            parent volume.

                        RecordSizeKiB -> (integer)

                            (KiB). Valid values are 4, 8,  16,  32,  64,  128,
                            256,  512,  or  1024  KiB. The default is 128 KiB.
                            Most workloads should use the default record size.
                            For  guidance on when to set a custom record size,
                            see the Amazon FSx for OpenZFS User Guide .

                        DataCompressionType -> (string)
                            Specifies the method used to compress the data  on
                            the  volume.  The  compression type is NONE by de-
                            fault.

                            o NONE - Doesn't compress the data on the  volume.
                              NONE is the default.

                            o ZSTD  -  Compresses the data in the volume using
                              the Zstandard (ZSTD) compression algorithm. Com-
                              pared  to LZ4, Z-Standard provides a better com-
                              pression ratio to minimize on-disk storage  uti-
                              lization.

                            o LZ4  -  Compresses  the data in the volume using
                              the  LZ4  compression  algorithm.  Compared   to
                              Z-Standard,  LZ4  is  less compute-intensive and
                              delivers higher write throughput speeds.

                        CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                            A Boolean value indicating whether  tags  for  the
                            volume  should  be copied to snapshots. This value
                            defaults to false . If it's set to true , all tags
                            for  the  volume are copied to snapshots where the
                            user doesn't specify tags. If this value  is  true
                            and  you specify one or more tags, only the speci-
                            fied tags are copied to snapshots. If you  specify
                            one  or  more  tags when creating the snapshot, no
                            tags are copied from  the  volume,  regardless  of
                            this value.

                        OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                            The  configuration object that specifies the snap-
                            shot to use as the origin of the data for the vol-
                            ume.

                            SnapshotARN -> (string)
                               The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a given re-
                               source. ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web  Ser-
                               vices  resources.  We  require  an ARN when you
                               need to specify a resource unambiguously across
                               all  of  Amazon Web Services. For more informa-
                               tion, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)  in  the
                               Amazon Web Services General Reference .

                            CopyStrategy -> (string)
                               The  strategy  used  when copying data from the
                               snapshot to the new volume.

                               o CLONE - The new volume references the data in
                                 the  origin  snapshot.  Cloning a snapshot is
                                 faster than copying the data from a  snapshot
                                 to  a  new  volume  and  doesn't consume disk
                                 throughput.  However,  the  origin   snapshot
                                 can't  be  deleted if there is a volume using
                                 its copied data.

                               o FULL_COPY - Copies all data from the snapshot
                                 to the new volume.

                        ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                            A  Boolean  value indicating whether the volume is
                            read-only.

                        NfsExports -> (list)

                            File System (NFS) file system.

                            (structure)
                               The  Network  File  System (NFS) configurations
                               for mounting an Amazon  FSx  for  OpenZFS  file
                               system.

                                   tain the client and  options  for  mounting
                                   the OpenZFS file system.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies  who can mount an OpenZFS file
                                      system and the options  available  while
                                      mounting the file system.

                                      Clients -> (string)
                                          A value that specifies who can mount
                                          the file system. You can  provide  a
                                          wildcard  character  (* ), an IP ad-
                                          dress (0.0.0.0 ), or a CIDR  address
                                          (192.0.2.0/24  ). By default, Amazon
                                          FSx uses the wildcard character when
                                          specifying the client.

                                      Options -> (list)
                                          The options to use when mounting the
                                          file system. For a list  of  options
                                          that  you  can use with Network File
                                          System (NFS), see the  exports(5)  -
                                          Linux  man page . When choosing your
                                          options, consider the following:

                                          o crossmnt is used  by  default.  If
                                            you  don't  specify  crossmnt when
                                            changing the client configuration,
                                            you won't be able to see or access
                                            snapshots in  your  file  system's
                                            snapshot directory.

                                          o sync  is  used  by default. If you
                                            instead specify async , the system
                                            acknowledges writes before writing
                                            to disk. If the system crashes be-
                                            fore  the writes are finished, you
                                            lose the unwritten data.

                                 TEM_UPDATE task to increase a  file  system's
                                 storage  capacity has been completed success-
                                 fully, a STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION task starts.

                                 o For Windows and ONTAP, storage optimization
                                   is the process of migrating the file system
                                   data to newer larger disks.

                                   of rebalancing the data across the existing
                                   and newly added file servers.

                               You can track the storage-optimization progress
                               using  the ProgressPercent property. When STOR-

                                      FSx file system. Aliases  allow  you  to
                                      use  existing  DNS  names  to access the
                                      data in your Amazon FSx file system. You
                                      can  associate  up  to 50 aliases with a
                                      file system at any time. You  can  asso-
                                      ciate  additional  DNS aliases after you
                                      create the file system using the Associ-
                                      ateFileSystemAliases  operation. You can
                                      remove DNS aliases from the file  system
                                      after it is created using the Disassoci-

                                      need  to  specify  the alias name in the
                                      request payload. For  more  information,

                                      tre file system. Scratch deployment type
                                      is designed for  temporary  storage  and
                                      shorter-term processing of data.
                                          SCRATCH_1  and  SCRATCH_2 deployment
                                          types are best suited for  when  you
                                          need     temporary    storage    and
                                          shorter-term processing of data. The
                                          SCRATCH_2  deployment  type provides
                                          in-transit encryption  of  data  and
                                          higher   burst  throughput  capacity
                                          than SCRATCH_1 .

                                      ployment  type  is  used for longer-term
                                      storage and workloads and encryption  of
                                      data  in  transit. PERSISTENT_2 is built
                                      on Lustre v2.12 and  offers  higher  Pe-
                                      rUnitStorageThroughput   (up   to   1000
                                      MB/s/TiB) along  with  a  lower  minimum
                                      storage  capacity requirement (600 GiB).

                                      ing the file system.

                                      For  the SCRATCH_1 deployment type, this
                                      value is always "fsx ". For SCRATCH_2  ,
                                      PERSISTENT_1  , and PERSISTENT_2 deploy-
                                      ment types, this value is a string  that
                                      is  unique within an Amazon Web Services
                                      Region.

                                   DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime -> (string)
                                      A recurring daily time,  in  the  format
                                      HH:MM  .  HH  is the zero-padded hour of
                                      the  day   (0-23),   and   MM   is   the
                                      zero-padded  minute of the hour. For ex-
                                      ample, 05:00 specifies 5 AM daily.

                                   AutomaticBackupRetentionDays -> (integer)
                                      The number of days to  retain  automatic
                                      backups. Setting this property to 0 dis-
                                      ables automatic backups. You can  retain
                                      automatic  backups  for  a maximum of 90
                                      days. The default is 0 .

                                   CopyTagsToBackups -> (boolean)
                                      A boolean flag indicating  whether  tags
                                      on  the  file system are copied to back-
                                      ups. If it's set to true,  all  tags  on
                                      the  file system are copied to all auto-
                                      matic  backups  and  any  user-initiated
                                      backups  where  the user doesn't specify
                                      any tags. If this value is true, and you
                                      specify one or more tags, only the spec-
                                      ified tags are copied to backups. If you
                                      specify one or more tags when creating a
                                      user-initiated  backup,  no   tags   are
                                      copied  from the file system, regardless
                                      of this value. (Default = false)

                                   DriveCacheType -> (string)
                                      The type of drive cache used by  PERSIS-
                                      TENT_1 file systems that are provisioned
                                      with HDD storage devices. This parameter
                                      is  required  when  StorageType  is HDD.
                                      When set to READ the file system has  an
                                      SSD  storage  cache that is sized to 20%
                                      of the file system's  storage  capacity.
                                      This  improves  the performance for fre-
                                      quently accessed files by caching up  to
                                      20% of the total storage capacity.

                                      This  parameter  is  required when Stor-
                                      ageType is set to HDD.

                                      have the following values:

                                      o NONE - Data compression is turned  off
                                        for the file system.

                                      o LZ4  -  Data  compression is turned on
                                        with the LZ4 algorithm.

                                      mount the volume, along with the storage
                                      virtual machine (SVM) Domain Name System
                                      (DNS) name or IP address. You can create
                                      a  JunctionPath  directly below a parent
                                      volume junction or on a directory within
                                      a  volume.  A  JunctionPath for a volume
                                      named vol3 might be /vol1/vol2/vol3 , or
                                      /vol1/dir2/vol3      ,      or      even
                                      /dir1/dir2/vol3 .

                                      can be UNIX , NTFS , or MIXED .

                                   SizeInMegabytes -> (integer)
                                      The  configured  size  of the volume, in
                                      megabytes (MBs).

                                   StorageEfficiencyEnabled -> (boolean)
                                      The volume's storage efficiency setting.

                                   StorageVirtualMachineId -> (string)
                                      The ID of the volume's  storage  virtual
                                      machine.

                                   StorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)
                                      A  Boolean  flag indicating whether this
                                      volume is the root volume for its  stor-
                                      age virtual machine (SVM). Only one vol-
                                      ume on an SVM can be  the  root  volume.
                                      This  value  defaults to false . If this
                                      value is true , then  this  is  the  SVM
                                      root volume.

                                      This flag is useful when you're deleting
                                      an SVM, because you  must  first  delete
                                      all  non-root  volumes.  This flag, when
                                      set to false , helps you identify  which
                                      volumes  to delete before you can delete
                                      the SVM.

                                   TieringPolicy -> (structure)

                                          user  data  in  a volume must remain
                                          inactive  before  it  is  considered
                                          "cold"  and  moved  to  the capacity
                                          pool. Used with the AUTO  and  SNAP-
                                          SHOT_ONLY  tiering policies. Enter a
                                          whole number between 2 and 183.  De-
                                          fault  values  are  31 days for AUTO
                                          and 2 days for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          Specifies the tiering policy used to
                                          transition  data.  Default  value is
                                          SNAPSHOT_ONLY .

                                          o SNAPSHOT_ONLY - moves  cold  snap-
                                            shots to the capacity pool storage
                                            tier.

                                          o AUTO - moves cold  user  data  and
                                            snapshots  to  the  capacity  pool

                                            patterns.

                                          o ALL  -  moves all user data blocks
                                            in both the active file system and
                                            Snapshot  copies  to  the  storage
                                            pool tier.

                                          o NONE - keeps a  volume's  data  in
                                            the primary storage tier, prevent-
                                            ing it from being moved to the ca-
                                            pacity pool tier.

                                   UUID -> (string)
                                      The  volume's universally unique identi-
                                      fier (UUID).

                                   OntapVolumeType -> (string)
                                      Specifies the type of volume. Valid val-
                                      ues are the following:

                                      o RW  specifies  a read/write volume. RW
                                        is the default.

                                        volume. A load-sharing mirror  reduces
                                        the  network traffic to a FlexVol vol-
                                        ume by providing additional  read-only
                                        access to clients.

                                   StorageCapacityReservationGiB -> (integer)
                                      The amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB)
                                      to reserve from the parent  volume.  You
                                      can't reserve more storage than the par-
                                      ent volume has reserved.

                                   StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                                      The maximum amount of storage in  gibib-
                                      tyes  (GiB) that the volume can use from
                                      its parent.  You  can  specify  a  quota
                                      larger  than  the  storage on the parent
                                      volume.

                                   RecordSizeKiB -> (integer)
                                      The record size of an OpenZFS volume, in
                                      kibibytes  (KiB). Valid values are 4, 8,
                                      16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, or 1024  KiB.
                                      The  default  is 128 KiB. Most workloads
                                      should use the default record size.  For
                                      guidance  on when to set a custom record
                                      size, see the  Amazon  FSx  for  OpenZFS

                                   DataCompressionType -> (string)
                                      Specifies  the  method  used to compress
                                      the data on the volume. The  compression
                                      type is NONE by default.

                                      o NONE  -  Doesn't  compress the data on
                                        the volume. NONE is the default.

                                      o ZSTD - Compresses the data in the vol-
                                        ume  using  the  Zstandard (ZSTD) com-
                                        pression algorithm. Compared  to  LZ4,
                                        Z-Standard  provides a better compres-
                                        sion ratio to minimize on-disk storage
                                        utilization.

                                      o LZ4  - Compresses the data in the vol-
                                        ume using the  LZ4  compression  algo-
                                        rithm.  Compared to Z-Standard, LZ4 is
                                        less  compute-intensive  and  delivers
                                        higher write throughput speeds.

                                   CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                                      A  Boolean value indicating whether tags
                                      for the volume should be copied to snap-
                                      shots. This value defaults to false . If
                                      it's set to true , all tags for the vol-
                                      ume  are  copied  to snapshots where the
                                      user doesn't specify tags. If this value
                                      is  true  and  you  specify  one or more
                                      tags, only the specified tags are copied
                                      to snapshots. If you specify one or more
                                      tags when creating the snapshot, no tags
                                      are  copied  from the volume, regardless
                                      of this value.

                                   OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                                      The configuration object that  specifies
                                      the snapshot to use as the origin of the
                                      data for the volume.

                                      SnapshotARN -> (string)
                                          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a
                                          given  resource. ARNs uniquely iden-
                                          tify Amazon Web Services  resources.
                                          We  require  an ARN when you need to
                                          specify  a  resource   unambiguously
                                          across  all  of Amazon Web Services.
                                          For more information, see Amazon Re-
                                          source  Names  (ARNs)  in the Amazon

                                      CopyStrategy -> (string)
                                          The strategy used when copying  data
                                          from the snapshot to the new volume.

                                          o CLONE  - The new volume references
                                            the data in the  origin  snapshot.
                                            Cloning  a snapshot is faster than
                                            copying the data from  a  snapshot
                                            to  a  new volume and doesn't con-
                                            sume disk throughput. However, the
                                            origin  snapshot  can't be deleted
                                            if there is  a  volume  using  its
                                            copied data.

                                          o FULL_COPY  -  Copies all data from
                                            the snapshot to the new volume.

                                   ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                                      A Boolean value indicating  whether  the
                                      volume is read-only.

                                   NfsExports -> (list)
                                      The  configuration object for mounting a

                                   resource. ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web
                                   Services resources. We require an ARN  when
                                   you  need  to  specify a resource unambigu-
                                   ously across all of  Amazon  Web  Services.
                                   For  more  information, see Amazon Resource
                                   Names (ARNs) in  the  Amazon  Web  Services

                                   known as Unix time.

                               Lifecycle -> (string)
                                   The lifecycle status of the snapshot.

                                   o PENDING - Amazon FSx hasn't started  cre-
                                     ating the snapshot.

                                   o CREATING  -  Amazon  FSx  is creating the
                                     snapshot.

                                   o DELETING - Amazon  FSx  is  deleting  the
                                     snapshot.

                                   o AVAILABLE  - The snapshot is fully avail-
                                     able.

                               LifecycleTransitionReason -> (structure)
                                   Describes why a  resource  lifecycle  state
                                   changed.

                                   Message -> (string)
                                      A detailed error message.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies a key-value  pair  for  a  re-
                                      source tag.

                                      Key -> (string)
                                          A  value that specifies the TagKey ,
                                          the name of the tag. Tag  keys  must
                                          be  unique for the resource to which
                                          they are attached.

                                      Value -> (string)
                                          A value that specifies the  TagValue
                                          ,  the  value assigned to the corre-
                                          sponding tag key. Tag values can  be
                                          null  and don't have to be unique in
                                          a tag set. For example, you can have
                                          a key-value pair in a tag set of fi-
                                          nances : April and also of payroll :
                                          April .

          OpenZFSConfiguration -> (structure)
              The configuration of an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS volume.

              ParentVolumeId -> (string)
                 The ID of the parent volume.

              VolumePath -> (string)
                 The  path  to  the  volume from the root volume. For example,
                 fsx/parentVolume/volume1 .

              StorageCapacityReservationGiB -> (integer)
                 The amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB) to reserve from  the
                 parent volume. You can't reserve more storage than the parent
                 volume has reserved.

              StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                 The maximum amount of storage in  gibibtyes  (GiB)  that  the
                 volume  can  use  from  its  parent.  You can specify a quota
                 larger than the storage on the parent volume.

              RecordSizeKiB -> (integer)
                 The record size of an OpenZFS  volume,  in  kibibytes  (KiB).
                 Valid  values  are  4,  8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, or 1024
                 KiB. The default is 128 KiB. Most workloads  should  use  the
                 default  record  size.  For  guidance on when to set a custom
                 record size, see the Amazon FSx for OpenZFS User Guide .

              DataCompressionType -> (string)
                 Specifies the method used to compress the data on the volume.
                 The compression type is NONE by default.

                 o NONE - Doesn't compress the data on the volume. NONE is the
                   default.

                 o ZSTD - Compresses the data in the volume using  the  Zstan-
                   dard (ZSTD) compression algorithm. Compared to LZ4, Z-Stan-
                   dard  provides  a  better  compression  ratio  to  minimize
                   on-disk storage utilization.

                 o LZ4  - Compresses the data in the volume using the LZ4 com-
                   pression algorithm. Compared to  Z-Standard,  LZ4  is  less
                   compute-intensive  and  delivers  higher  write  throughput
                   speeds.

              CopyTagsToSnapshots -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean value indicating whether tags for the volume should
                 be  copied  to  snapshots.  This value defaults to false . If
                 it's set to true , all tags for  the  volume  are  copied  to
                 snapshots  where the user doesn't specify tags. If this value
                 is true and you specify one or more tags, only the  specified
                 tags are copied to snapshots. If you specify one or more tags
                 when creating the snapshot, no tags are copied from the  vol-
                 ume, regardless of this value.

              OriginSnapshot -> (structure)
                 The  configuration  object that specifies the snapshot to use
                 as the origin of the data for the volume.

                 SnapshotARN -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a given resource. ARNs
                     uniquely  identify  Amazon Web Services resources. We re-
                     quire an ARN when you need to specify  a  resource  unam-
                     biguously across all of Amazon Web Services. For more in-
                     formation, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the Amazon
                     Web Services General Reference .

                 CopyStrategy -> (string)
                     The  strategy used when copying data from the snapshot to
                     the new volume.

                     o CLONE - The new volume references the data in the  ori-
                       gin snapshot. Cloning a snapshot is faster than copying
                       the data from a snapshot to a new  volume  and  doesn't
                       consume  disk  throughput. However, the origin snapshot
                       can't be deleted if there is a volume using its  copied
                       data.

                     o FULL_COPY  -  Copies  all data from the snapshot to the
                       new volume.

              ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean value indicating whether the volume is read-only.

              NfsExports -> (list)
                 The configuration object for mounting a Network  File  System
                 (NFS) file system.

                 (structure)
                     The Network File System (NFS) configurations for mounting
                     an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system.

                     ClientConfigurations -> (list)
                        A list  of  configuration  objects  that  contain  the
                        client  and options for mounting the OpenZFS file sys-
                        tem.

                        (structure)
                            Specifies who can mount an OpenZFS file system and
                            the options available while mounting the file sys-
                            tem.

                            Clients -> (string)
                               A value that specifies who can mount  the  file
                               system. You can provide a wildcard character (*
                               ), an IP address (0.0.0.0 ), or a CIDR  address
                               (192.0.2.0/24  ).  By  default, Amazon FSx uses
                               the  wildcard  character  when  specifying  the
                               client.

                            Options -> (list)
                               The  options to use when mounting the file sys-
                               tem. For a list of options  that  you  can  use
                               with   Network   File  System  (NFS),  see  the
                               exports(5) - Linux man  page  .  When  choosing
                               your options, consider the following:

                               o crossmnt  is  used  by  default. If you don't
                                 specify crossmnt  when  changing  the  client
                                 configuration,  you  won't  be able to see or
                                 access snapshots in your file system's  snap-
                                 shot directory.

                               o sync is used by default. If you instead spec-
                                 ify async , the  system  acknowledges  writes
                                 before writing to disk. If the system crashes
                                 before the writes are finished, you lose  the
                                 unwritten data.

                               (string)

              UserAndGroupQuotas -> (list)
                 An object specifying how much storage users or groups can use
                 on the volume.

                 (structure)
                     The configuration for how much storage a  user  or  group
                     can use on the volume.

                     Type -> (string)
                        A  value that specifies whether the quota applies to a
                        user or group.

                     Id -> (integer)
                        The ID of the user or group.

                     StorageCapacityQuotaGiB -> (integer)
                        The amount of storage that the user or group  can  use
                        in gibibytes (GiB).
