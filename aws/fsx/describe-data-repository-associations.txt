NAME
       describe-data-repository-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the description of specific Amazon FSx for Lustre data reposi-
       tory associations, if one or more AssociationIds values are provided in
       the request, or if filters are used in the request. Data repository as-
       sociations are supported only for file systems  with  the  Persistent_2
       deployment type.

       You can use filters to narrow the response to include just data reposi-
       tory associations for specific file  systems  (use  the  file-system-id
       filter  with the ID of the file system) or data repository associations
       for a specific repository type  (use  the  data-repository-type  filter
       with  a  value  of S3 ). If you don't use filters, the response returns
       all data repository associations owned by your Amazon Web Services  ac-
       count  in  the  Amazon  Web Services Region of the endpoint that you're
       calling.

       When retrieving all data repository associations, you can paginate  the
       response by using the optional MaxResults parameter to limit the number
       of data repository associations returned in a response.  If  more  data
       repository associations remain, Amazon FSx returns a NextToken value in
       the response. In this case, send a later request with the NextToken re-
       quest parameter set to the value of NextToken from the last response.

          [--association-ids <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --association-ids (list)
          IDs  of the data repository associations whose descriptions you want
          to retrieve (String).

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          A list of Filter elements.

          (structure)
              A filter used to restrict the results of describe calls. You can
              use  multiple  filters  to  return results that meet all applied
              filter requirements.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name for this filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The values of the filter. These are all the values for any of
                 the applied filters.

                 (string)
                     The value for a filter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "file-system-id"|"backup-type"|"file-system-type"|"volume-id"|"data-repository-type",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  resources  to return in the response. This
          value must be an integer greater than zero.

       --next-token (string)
          (Optional) Opaque pagination token returned from a  previous  opera-
          tion  (String). If present, this token indicates from what point you
          can continue processing the request, where  the  previous  NextToken
          value left off.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Associations -> (list)
          An array of one ore more data repository association descriptions.

          (structure)
              The configuration of a data repository association that links an
              Amazon  FSx  for  Lustre file system to an Amazon S3 bucket. The
              data repository association configuration object is returned  in
              the response of the following operations:

              o CreateDataRepositoryAssociation

              o UpdateDataRepositoryAssociation

              o DescribeDataRepositoryAssociations

              Data repository associations are supported only for file systems
              with the Persistent_2 deployment type.

              AssociationId -> (string)
                 The system-generated, unique ID of the data repository  asso-
                 ciation.

              ResourceARN -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) for a given resource. ARNs
                 uniquely identify Amazon Web Services resources.  We  require
                 an  ARN  when  you  need  to specify a resource unambiguously
                 across all of Amazon Web Services. For more information,  see
                 Amazon  Resource Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services Gen-
                 eral Reference .

              FileSystemId -> (string)
                 The globally unique ID of the file system, assigned by Amazon
                 FSx.

              Lifecycle -> (string)
                 Describes  the  state  of  a data repository association. The
                 lifecycle can have the following values:

                 o CREATING - The data repository association between the  FSx
                   file  system  and  the S3 data repository is being created.
                   The data repository is unavailable.

                 o AVAILABLE - The data repository  association  is  available
                   for use.

                 o MISCONFIGURED  - Amazon FSx cannot automatically import up-
                   dates from the S3 bucket or automatically export updates to
                   the S3 bucket until the data repository association config-
                   uration is corrected.

                 o UPDATING - The data repository association is undergoing  a
                   customer  initiated update that might affect its availabil-
                   ity.

                 o DELETING - The data repository association is undergoing  a
                   customer initiated deletion.

                 o FAILED  -  The data repository association is in a terminal
                   state that cannot be recovered.

              FailureDetails -> (structure)
                 Provides detailed information about the data  respository  if
                 its Lifecycle is set to MISCONFIGURED or FAILED .

                 Message -> (string)
                     A detailed error message.

              FileSystemPath -> (string)
                 A  path on the file system that points to a high-level direc-
                 tory (such as /ns1/ ) or subdirectory (such as /ns1/subdir/ )
                 that will be mapped 1-1 with DataRepositoryPath . The leading
                 forward slash in the name is required.  Two  data  repository
                 associations  cannot  have overlapping file system paths. For
                 example, if a data repository is associated with file  system
                 path  /ns1/  ,  then  you cannot link another data repository
                 with file system path /ns1/ns2 .

                 This path specifies where in your file system files  will  be
                 exported  from or imported to. This file system directory can
                 be linked to only one Amazon  S3  bucket,  and  no  other  S3
                 bucket can be linked to the directory.

              DataRepositoryPath -> (string)
                 The path to the Amazon S3 data repository that will be linked
                 to the file system. The path can be an S3 bucket or prefix in
                 the  format  s3://myBucket/myPrefix/  .  This  path specifies
                 where in the S3 data repository files will be  imported  from
                 or exported to.

              BatchImportMetaDataOnCreate -> (boolean)
                 A  boolean  flag indicating whether an import data repository
                 task to import metadata should run after the data  repository
                 association  is created. The task runs if this flag is set to
                 true .

              ImportedFileChunkSize -> (integer)
                 For files imported from a data repository, this value  deter-
                 mines  the  stripe  count and maximum amount of data per file
                 (in MiB) stored on a single physical disk. The maximum number
                 of  disks that a single file can be striped across is limited
                 by the total number of disks that make up the file system.

                 The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB)  and  can  go  as
                 high as 512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a maxi-
                 mum size of 5 TB.

              S3 -> (structure)
                 The configuration for an Amazon S3 data repository linked  to
                 an Amazon FSx Lustre file system with a data repository asso-
                 ciation. The configuration defines which  file  events  (new,
                 changed,  or  deleted files or directories) are automatically
                 imported from the linked data repository to the  file  system
                 or  automatically  exported  from the file system to the data
                 repository.

                 AutoImportPolicy -> (structure)
                     Specifies the type  of  updated  objects  (new,  changed,
                     deleted)  that  will  be  automatically imported from the
                     linked S3 bucket to your file system.

                     Events -> (list)
                        The AutoImportPolicy can have the following event val-
                        ues:

                        o NEW  -  Amazon FSx automatically imports metadata of
                          files added to the linked S3 bucket that do not cur-
                          rently exist in the FSx file system.

                        o CHANGED  -  Amazon  FSx  automatically  updates file
                          metadata and invalidates existing  file  content  on
                          the  file system as files change in the data reposi-
                          tory.

                        o DELETED - Amazon FSx automatically deletes files  on
                          the  file  system as corresponding files are deleted
                          in the data repository.

                        You can define any combination of event types for your
                        AutoImportPolicy .

                        (string)

                 AutoExportPolicy -> (structure)
                     Specifies  the  type  of  updated  objects (new, changed,
                     deleted) that will be automatically  exported  from  your
                     file system to the linked S3 bucket.

                     Events -> (list)
                        The AutoExportPolicy can have the following event val-
                        ues:

                        o NEW - Amazon FSx automatically exports new files and
                          directories to the data repository as they are added
                          to the file system.

                        o CHANGED - Amazon FSx automatically  exports  changes
                          to  files  and directories on the file system to the
                          data repository.

                        o DELETED - Files and  directories  are  automatically
                          deleted on the data repository when they are deleted
                          on the file system.

                        You can define any combination of event types for your

                        (string)

              Tags -> (list)
                 A list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        A  value  that  specifies the TagKey , the name of the
                        tag. Tag keys must be unique for the resource to which
                        they are attached.

                     Value -> (string)
                        A  value  that  specifies the TagValue , the value as-
                        signed to the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be
                        null and don't have to be unique in a tag set. For ex-
                        ample, you can have a key-value pair in a tag  set  of
                        finances : April and also of payroll : April .

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  that  the  resource was created, in seconds (since

       NextToken -> (string)
          (Optional) Opaque pagination token returned from a  previous  opera-
          tion  (String). If present, this token indicates from what point you
          can continue processing the request, where  the  previous  NextToken
          value left off.
