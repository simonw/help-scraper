CREATE-DATA-REPOSITORY-TASK()                    CREATE-DATA-REPOSITORY-TASK()



NAME
       create-data-repository-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  Amazon  FSx  for  Lustre  data  repository task. A Create-
       DataRepositoryTask operation will fail if  a  data  repository  is  not
       linked to the FSx file system.

       You  use import and export data repository tasks to perform bulk opera-
       tions between your FSx for Lustre  file  system  and  its  linked  data
       repositories.  An  example  of  a data repository task is exporting any
       data and metadata changes, including POSIX metadata, to files, directo-
       ries,  and  symbolic  links  (symlinks)  from your FSx file system to a
       linked data repository.

       You use release data repository tasks to release data  from  your  file
       system  for  files  that  are  exported to S3. The metadata of released
       files remains on the file system so users or applications can still ac-
       cess released files by reading the files again, which will restore data
       from Amazon S3 to the FSx for Lustre file system.

       To  learn more about linking a data repository to your file system, see
       Linking your file system to an S3 bucket .

OPTIONS
       --type (string)
          Specifies the type of data repository task to create.

          o EXPORT_TO_REPOSITORY tasks export from your Amazon FSx for  Lustre
            file system to a linked data repository.

          o IMPORT_METADATA_FROM_REPOSITORY tasks import metadata changes from
            a linked S3 bucket to your Amazon FSx for Lustre file system.

          o RELEASE_DATA_FROM_FILESYSTEM tasks release files  in  your  Amazon
            FSx  for Lustre file system that have been exported to a linked S3
            bucket and that meet your specified release criteria.

          o AUTO_RELEASE_DATA tasks automatically release files from an Amazon
            File Cache resource.

          Possible values:

          o EXPORT_TO_REPOSITORY

          o IMPORT_METADATA_FROM_REPOSITORY

          o RELEASE_DATA_FROM_FILESYSTEM

          o AUTO_RELEASE_DATA

       --paths (list)
          A list of paths for the data repository task to use when the task is
          processed. If a path that you provide isn't valid, the  task  fails.
          If  you  don't  provide paths, the default behavior is to export all
          files to S3 (for export tasks), import all files from S3 (for import
          tasks),  or  release  all exported files that meet the last accessed
          time criteria (for release tasks).

          o For export tasks, the list contains paths on the  FSx  for  Lustre
            file  system  from  which  the files are exported to the Amazon S3
            bucket. The default path is the file system  root  directory.  The
            paths  you  provide  need to be relative to the mount point of the
            file system. If the mount point is /mnt/fsx and /mnt/fsx/path1  is
            a  directory  or  file on the file system you want to export, then
            the path to provide is path1 .

          o For import tasks, the list contains paths in the Amazon S3  bucket
            from which POSIX metadata changes are imported to the FSx for Lus-
            tre file system. The path can be an S3 bucket  or  prefix  in  the
            format s3://bucket-name/prefix (where prefix is optional).

          o For  release  tasks,  the list contains directory or file paths on
            the FSx for Lustre file system  from  which  to  release  exported
            files. If a directory is specified, files within the directory are
            released. If a file path is specified, only that file is released.
            To  release  all exported files in the file system, specify a for-
            ward slash (/) as the path.

          NOTE:
              A file must also meet the last accessed time criteria  specified
              in for the file to be released.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --file-system-id (string)
          The globally unique ID of the file system, assigned by Amazon FSx.

       --report (structure)
          Defines  whether  or not Amazon FSx provides a CompletionReport once
          the task has completed. A CompletionReport provides a  detailed  re-
          port  on  the files that Amazon FSx processed that meet the criteria
          specified by the Scope parameter. For more information, see  Working
          with Task Completion Reports .

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Set Enabled to True to generate a CompletionReport when the task
              completes. If set to true , then you need to  provide  a  report
              Scope  ,  Path , and Format . Set Enabled to False if you do not
              want a CompletionReport generated when the task completes.

          Path -> (string)
              Required if Enabled is set to true . Specifies the  location  of
              the  report  on  the file system's linked S3 data repository. An
              absolute path that defines where the completion report  will  be
              stored in the destination location. The Path you provide must be
              located within the file  systems  ExportPath.  An  example  Path
              value is "s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/myExportPath/optionalPrefix".
              The report provides the following information for each  file  in
              the report: FilePath, FileStatus, and ErrorCode.

          Format -> (string)
              Required if Enabled is set to true . Specifies the format of the
              CompletionReport . REPORT_CSV_20191124 is the only  format  cur-
              rently  supported.  When  Format is set to REPORT_CSV_20191124 ,
              the CompletionReport is provided in CSV format, and is delivered
              to {path}/task-{id}/failures.csv .

          Scope -> (string)
              Required  if Enabled is set to true . Specifies the scope of the
              CompletionReport ; FAILED_FILES_ONLY is the only scope currently
              supported.  When Scope is set to FAILED_FILES_ONLY , the Comple-
              tionReport only contains information about files that  the  data
              repository task failed to process.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Enabled=boolean,Path=string,Format=string,Scope=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Enabled": true|false,

            "Scope": "FAILED_FILES_ONLY"
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          (Optional)  An  idempotency token for resource creation, in a string
          of up to 63 ASCII characters. This token is automatically filled  on
          your behalf when you use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Ama-
          zon Web Services SDK.

       --tags (list)
          A list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

          (structure)
              Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 A value that specifies the TagKey , the name of the tag.  Tag
                 keys  must  be  unique for the resource to which they are at-
                 tached.

              Value -> (string)
                 A value that specifies the TagValue , the value  assigned  to
                 the  corresponding  tag key. Tag values can be null and don't
                 have to be unique in a tag set. For example, you can  have  a
                 key-value  pair  in a tag set of finances : April and also of
                 payroll : April .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --capacity-to-release (long)
          Specifies the amount of data to release, in GiB, by an  Amazon  File
          Cache  AUTO_RELEASE_DATA task that automatically releases files from
          the cache.

       --release-configuration (structure)
          The configuration that specifies the last accessed time criteria for
          files  that will be released from an Amazon FSx for Lustre file sys-
          tem.

          DurationSinceLastAccess -> (structure)
              Defines the point-in-time since an exported file  was  last  ac-
              cessed,  in order for that file to be eligible for release. Only
              files that were last accessed before this point-in-time are eli-
              gible to be released from the file system.

              Unit -> (string)
                 The  unit of time used by the Value parameter to determine if
                 a file can be released, based on when it was  last  accessed.
                 DAYS  is the only supported value. This is a required parame-
                 ter.

              Value -> (long)
                 An integer that represents the minimum  amount  of  time  (in
                 days) since a file was last accessed in the file system. Only
                 exported files with a MAX(atime, ctime, mtime) timestamp that
                 is more than this amount of time in the past (relative to the
                 task create time) will be released. The default of Value is 0
                 . This is a required parameter.

                 NOTE:
                     If  an  exported file meets the last accessed time crite-
                     ria, its file or directory path must also be specified in
                     the  Paths  parameter  of  the operation in order for the
                     file to be released.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DurationSinceLastAccess={Unit=string,Value=long}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DurationSinceLastAccess": {
              "Unit": "DAYS",
              "Value": long
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,

              o FAILED  -  The task was not able to be completed. For example,
                there may be files the task failed to process. The  DataRepos-
                itoryTaskFailureDetails  property  provides  more  information
                about task failures.

              o SUCCEEDED - The task has completed successfully.

              o CANCELED - The task was canceled and it did not complete.

              o CANCELING - The task is in process of being canceled.

              NOTE:
                 You cannot delete an FSx for Lustre file system if there  are
                 data  repository  tasks for the file system in the PENDING or
                 EXECUTING states. Please retry when the data repository  task
                 is  finished  (with  a  status  of  CANCELED , SUCCEEDED , or
                 FAILED ). You can use the  DescribeDataRepositoryTask  action
                 to  monitor the task status. Contact the FSx team if you need
                 to delete your file system immediately.

          Type -> (string)
              The type of data repository task.

                from a linked S3 bucket to your Amazon  FSx  for  Lustre  file
                system.

              o RELEASE_DATA_FROM_FILESYSTEM  tasks release files in your Ama-
                zon FSx for Lustre file system that have been  exported  to  a
                linked  S3  bucket and that meet your specified release crite-
                ria.

          ResourceARN -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  for  a  given resource. ARNs
              uniquely identify Amazon Web Services resources. We  require  an
              ARN when you need to specify a resource unambiguously across all
              of Amazon Web Services. For more  information,  see  Amazon  Re-
              source Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference
              .

          Tags -> (list)
              A list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

              (structure)

                 Value -> (string)
                     A value that specifies the TagValue , the value  assigned
                     to  the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null and
                     don't have to be unique in a tag set.  For  example,  you
                     can  have  a  key-value  pair  in a tag set of finances :
                     April and also of payroll : April .

          FileSystemId -> (string)
              The globally unique ID of the file system.

          Paths -> (list)
              An array of paths that specify the data for the data  repository
              task  to  process. For example, in an EXPORT_TO_REPOSITORY task,
              the paths specify which data to export to the linked data repos-
              itory.

              (Default)  If  Paths  is not specified, Amazon FSx uses the file
              system root directory.

              (string)

          FailureDetails -> (structure)
              Failure message describing why the task failed, it is  populated
              only when Lifecycle is set to FAILED .

              Message -> (string)
                 A detailed error message.

          Status -> (structure)
              Provides  the  status  of  the number of files that the task has
              processed successfully and failed to process.

              TotalCount -> (long)
                 The total number of files that the task will process. While a
                 task is executing, the sum of SucceededCount plus FailedCount
                 may not equal TotalCount . When the task is complete,  Total-
                 Count equals the sum of SucceededCount plus FailedCount .

              SucceededCount -> (long)
                 A running total of the number of files that the task has suc-
                 cessfully processed.

                 A running total of the number of files that the  task  failed
                 to process.

              LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the task status was last updated.

              ReleasedCapacity -> (long)
                 The  total amount of data, in GiB, released by an Amazon File
                 Cache  AUTO_RELEASE_DATA  task  that  automatically  releases
                 files from the cache.

          Report -> (structure)
              Provides  a report detailing the data repository task results of
              the files processed that match the criteria specified in the re-
              port  Scope  parameter. FSx delivers the report to the file sys-
              tem's linked data repository in Amazon S3, using the path speci-
              fied  in  the  report Path parameter. You can specify whether or
              not a report gets generated for a task using the Enabled parame-
              ter.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Set  Enabled  to True to generate a CompletionReport when the
                 task completes. If set to true , then you need to  provide  a
                 report  Scope  ,  Path , and Format . Set Enabled to False if
                 you do not want a CompletionReport generated  when  the  task
                 completes.

              Path -> (string)
                 Required  if  Enabled is set to true . Specifies the location
                 of the report on the file system's linked S3 data repository.
                 An  absolute  path  that  defines where the completion report
                 will be stored in the destination location. The Path you pro-
                 vide  must  be located within the file systems ExportPath. An
                 example  Path  value  is  "s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/myExport-
                 Path/optionalPrefix".  The  report provides the following in-
                 formation for each file in the report: FilePath,  FileStatus,
                 and ErrorCode.

              Format -> (string)
                 Required  if Enabled is set to true . Specifies the format of
                 the CompletionReport . REPORT_CSV_20191124 is the only format
                 currently    supported.   When   Format   is   set   to   RE-
                 PORT_CSV_20191124 , the CompletionReport is provided  in  CSV
                 format, and is delivered to {path}/task-{id}/failures.csv .

              Scope -> (string)
                 Required  if  Enabled is set to true . Specifies the scope of
                 the CompletionReport ; FAILED_FILES_ONLY is  the  only  scope
                 currently supported. When Scope is set to FAILED_FILES_ONLY ,
                 the CompletionReport only contains  information  about  files
                 that the data repository task failed to process.

          CapacityToRelease -> (long)
              Specifies  the  amount  of data to release, in GiB, by an Amazon
              File Cache AUTO_RELEASE_DATA task  that  automatically  releases
              files from the cache.

          FileCacheId -> (string)
              The system-generated, unique ID of the cache.

          ReleaseConfiguration -> (structure)
              The configuration that specifies the last accessed time criteria
              for files that will be released from an Amazon  FSx  for  Lustre
              file system.

              DurationSinceLastAccess -> (structure)
                 Defines the point-in-time since an exported file was last ac-
                 cessed, in order for that file to be  eligible  for  release.
                 Only  files that were last accessed before this point-in-time
                 are eligible to be released from the file system.

                 Unit -> (string)
                     The unit of time used by the Value parameter to determine
                     if  a file can be released, based on when it was last ac-
                     cessed. DAYS is the only supported value. This is  a  re-
                     quired parameter.

                 Value -> (long)
                     An integer that represents the minimum amount of time (in
                     days) since a file was last accessed in the file  system.
                     Only exported files with a MAX(atime, ctime, mtime) time-
                     stamp that is more than this amount of time in  the  past
                     (relative  to the task create time) will be released. The
                     default of Value is 0 . This is a required parameter.

                     NOTE:
                        If an exported file meets the last accessed time  cri-
                        teria,  its file or directory path must also be speci-
                        fied in the Paths parameter of the operation in  order
                        for the file to be released.
