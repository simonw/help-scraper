CREATE-DATA-REPOSITORY-TASK()                    CREATE-DATA-REPOSITORY-TASK()



NAME
       create-data-repository-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  Amazon  FSx  for Lustre data repository task. You use data
       repository tasks to perform bulk operations  between  your  Amazon  FSx
       file  system  and  its  linked  data repositories. An example of a data
       repository task is exporting any data and metadata  changes,  including
       POSIX  metadata,  to  files, directories, and symbolic links (symlinks)
       from your FSx file system  to  a  linked  data  repository.  A  Create-
       DataRepositoryTask  operation  will  fail  if  a data repository is not
       linked to the FSx file system. To  learn  more  about  data  repository
       tasks,  see  Data Repository Tasks . To learn more about linking a data
       repository to your file system, see Linking your file system to  an  S3
       bucket .

SYNOPSIS
            create-data-repository-task
          --type <value>
          [--paths <value>]
          --file-system-id <value>
          --report <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --type (string)
          Specifies the type of data repository task to create.

          Possible values:

          o EXPORT_TO_REPOSITORY

          o IMPORT_METADATA_FROM_REPOSITORY

       --paths (list)
          (Optional)  The  path  or paths on the Amazon FSx file system to use
          when the data repository task is processed. The default path is  the
          file  system  root directory. The paths you provide need to be rela-
          tive to the mount point of the file system. If the  mount  point  is
          /mnt/fsx  and /mnt/fsx/path1 is a directory or file on the file sys-
          tem you want to export, then the path to provide is  path1  .  If  a
          path that you provide isn't valid, the task fails.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --file-system-id (string)
          The globally unique ID of the file system, assigned by Amazon FSx.

       --report (structure)
          Defines  whether  or not Amazon FSx provides a CompletionReport once
          the task has completed. A CompletionReport provides a  detailed  re-
          port  on  the files that Amazon FSx processed that meet the criteria
          specified by the Scope parameter. For more information, see  Working
          with Task Completion Reports .

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Set Enabled to True to generate a CompletionReport when the task
              completes. If set to true , then you need to  provide  a  report
              Scope  ,  Path , and Format . Set Enabled to False if you do not
              want a CompletionReport generated when the task completes.

          Path -> (string)
              Required if Enabled is set to true . Specifies the  location  of
              the  report  on  the file system's linked S3 data repository. An
              absolute path that defines where the completion report  will  be
              stored in the destination location. The Path you provide must be
              located within the file  systems  ExportPath.  An  example  Path
              value is "s3://myBucket/myExportPath/optionalPrefix". The report
              provides the following information for each file in the  report:
              FilePath,  FileStatus, and ErrorCode. To learn more about a file
              system's ExportPath , see .

          Format -> (string)
              Required if Enabled is set to true . Specifies the format of the
              CompletionReport  .  REPORT_CSV_20191124 is the only format cur-
              rently supported. When Format is set  to  REPORT_CSV_20191124  ,
              the CompletionReport is provided in CSV format, and is delivered
              to {path}/task-{id}/failures.csv .

          Scope -> (string)
              Required if Enabled is set to true . Specifies the scope of  the
              CompletionReport ; FAILED_FILES_ONLY is the only scope currently
              supported. When Scope is set to FAILED_FILES_ONLY , the  Comple-
              tionReport  only  contains information about files that the data
              repository task failed to process.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Enabled=boolean,Path=string,Format=string,Scope=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Enabled": true|false,
            "Path": "string",
            "Format": "REPORT_CSV_20191124",
            "Scope": "FAILED_FILES_ONLY"
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          (Optional) An idempotency token for resource creation, in  a  string
          of  up to 64 ASCII characters. This token is automatically filled on
          your behalf when you use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Ama-
          zon Web Services SDK.

       --tags (list)
          A list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

          (structure)
              Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  value that specifies the TagKey , the name of the tag. Tag
                 keys must be unique for the resource to which  they  are  at-
                 tached.

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  that specifies the TagValue , the value assigned to
                 the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null  and  don't
                 have  to  be unique in a tag set. For example, you can have a
                 key-value pair in a tag set of finances : April and  also  of
                 payroll : April .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DataRepositoryTask -> (structure)
          The description of the data repository task that you just created.

          TaskId -> (string)
              The  system-generated, unique 17-digit ID of the data repository
              task.

          Lifecycle -> (string)
              The lifecycle status of the data repository task, as follows:

              o PENDING - Amazon FSx has not started the task.

              o EXECUTING - Amazon FSx is processing the task.

              o FAILED - Amazon FSx was not able to complete the task. For ex-
                ample,  there  may  be  files  the task failed to process. The
                DataRepositoryTaskFailureDetails property provides more infor-
                mation about task failures.

              o SUCCEEDED - FSx completed the task successfully.

              o CANCELED  -  Amazon  FSx canceled the task and it did not com-
                plete.

              o CANCELING - FSx is in process of canceling the task.

              NOTE:
                 You cannot delete an FSx for Lustre file system if there  are
                 data  repository  tasks for the file system in the PENDING or
                 EXECUTING states. Please retry when the data repository  task
                 is  finished  (with  a  status  of  CANCELED , SUCCEEDED , or
                 FAILED ). You can use the  DescribeDataRepositoryTask  action
                 to  monitor the task status. Contact the FSx team if you need
                 to delete your file system immediately.

          Type -> (string)
              The type of data repository task.

              o The EXPORT_TO_REPOSITORY data  repository  task  exports  from
                your Lustre file system from to a linked S3 bucket.

              o The  IMPORT_METADATA_FROM_REPOSITORY  data repository task im-
                ports metadata changes from a linked S3 bucket to your  Lustre
                file system.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The  time  that  the  resource  was  created,  in seconds (since
              1970-01-01T00:00:00Z), also known as Unix time.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that Amazon FSx began processing the task.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that Amazon FSx completed processing  the  task,  popu-
              lated after the task is complete.

          ResourceARN -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  for  a  given resource. ARNs
              uniquely identify Amazon Web Services resources. We  require  an
              ARN when you need to specify a resource unambiguously across all
              of Amazon Web Services. For more  information,  see  Amazon  Re-
              source Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference
              .

          Tags -> (list)
              A list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

              (structure)
                 Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

                 Key -> (string)
                     A value that specifies the TagKey , the name of the  tag.
                     Tag  keys  must  be unique for the resource to which they
                     are attached.

                 Value -> (string)
                     A value that specifies the TagValue , the value  assigned
                     to  the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null and
                     don't have to be unique in a tag set.  For  example,  you
                     can  have  a  key-value  pair  in a tag set of finances :
                     April and also of payroll : April .

          FileSystemId -> (string)
              The globally unique ID of the file system,  assigned  by  Amazon
              FSx.

          Paths -> (list)
              An  array of paths on the Amazon FSx for Lustre file system that
              specify the data for the data repository task  to  process.  For
              example,  in  an  EXPORT_TO_REPOSITORY  task,  the paths specify
              which data to export to the linked data repository.

              (Default) If Paths is not specified, Amazon FSx  uses  the  file
              system root directory.

              (string)

          FailureDetails -> (structure)
              Failure  message describing why the task failed, it is populated
              only when Lifecycle is set to FAILED .

              Message -> (string)
                 A detailed error message.

          Status -> (structure)
              Provides the status of the number of files  that  the  task  has
              processed successfully and failed to process.

              TotalCount -> (long)
                 The total number of files that the task will process. While a
                 task is executing, the sum of SucceededCount plus FailedCount
                 may  not equal TotalCount . When the task is complete, Total-
                 Count equals the sum of SucceededCount plus FailedCount .

              SucceededCount -> (long)
                 A running total of the number of files that the task has suc-
                 cessfully processed.

              FailedCount -> (long)
                 A  running  total of the number of files that the task failed
                 to process.

              LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the task status was last updated.

          Report -> (structure)
              Provides a report detailing the data repository task results  of
              the files processed that match the criteria specified in the re-
              port Scope parameter. FSx delivers the report to the  file  sys-
              tem's linked data repository in Amazon S3, using the path speci-
              fied in the report Path parameter. You can  specify  whether  or
              not a report gets generated for a task using the Enabled parame-
              ter.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Set Enabled to True to generate a CompletionReport  when  the
                 task  completes.  If set to true , then you need to provide a
                 report Scope , Path , and Format . Set Enabled  to  False  if
                 you  do  not  want a CompletionReport generated when the task
                 completes.

              Path -> (string)
                 Required if Enabled is set to true . Specifies  the  location
                 of the report on the file system's linked S3 data repository.
                 An absolute path that defines  where  the  completion  report
                 will be stored in the destination location. The Path you pro-
                 vide must be located within the file systems  ExportPath.  An
                 example  Path  value is "s3://myBucket/myExportPath/optional-
                 Prefix". The report provides the  following  information  for
                 each file in the report: FilePath, FileStatus, and ErrorCode.
                 To learn more about a file system's ExportPath , see .

              Format -> (string)
                 Required if Enabled is set to true . Specifies the format  of
                 the CompletionReport . REPORT_CSV_20191124 is the only format
                 currently   supported.   When   Format   is   set   to    RE-
                 PORT_CSV_20191124  ,  the CompletionReport is provided in CSV
                 format, and is delivered to {path}/task-{id}/failures.csv .

              Scope -> (string)
                 Required if Enabled is set to true . Specifies the  scope  of
                 the  CompletionReport  ;  FAILED_FILES_ONLY is the only scope
                 currently supported. When Scope is set to FAILED_FILES_ONLY ,
                 the  CompletionReport  only  contains information about files
                 that the data repository task failed to process.
