       resource-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       AWS  Resource Groups lets you organize AWS resources such as Amazon EC2
       instances, Amazon Relational Database Service databases, and Amazon  S3
       buckets  into groups using criteria that you define as tags. A resource
       group is a collection of resources that match the resource types speci-
       fied  in  a  query, and share one or more tags or portions of tags. You
       can create a group of resources based on their roles in your cloud  in-
       frastructure,  lifecycle stages, regions, application layers, or virtu-
       ally any criteria. Resource Groups enable you  to  automate  management
       tasks,  such  as  those in AWS Systems Manager Automation documents, on
       tag-related resources in AWS Systems  Manager.  Groups  of  tagged  re-
       sources  also let you quickly view a custom console in AWS Systems Man-
       ager that shows AWS Config compliance and other monitoring  data  about
       member resources.

       To  create  a  resource group, build a resource query, and specify tags
       that identify the criteria that members of the group  have  in  common.
       Tags are key-value pairs.

       For more information about Resource Groups, see the AWS Resource Groups
       User Guide .

       AWS Resource Groups uses a REST-compliant API that you can use to  per-
       form the following types of operations.

       o Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on resource groups
         and resource query entities

       o Applying, editing, and removing tags from resource groups

       o Resolving resource group member ARNs  so  they  can  be  returned  as
         search results

       o Getting data about resources that are members of a group

       o Searching AWS resources based on a resource query
