DESCRIPTION
       List  studios in your Amazon Web Services account in the requested Ama-
       zon Web Services Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-studios is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: studios

SYNOPSIS
            list-studios
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)

              A  studio is the core resource used with Nimble Studio. You must
              create a studio first, before any other  resource  type  can  be
              created.  All  other  resources  you create and manage in Nimble
              Studio are contained within a studio.

              When creating a studio, you must provides two IAM roles for  use
              with  the  Nimble Studio portal. These roles are assumed by your

              Web Services SSO and your identity source.

              The  user  role must have the AmazonNimbleStudio-StudioUser man-
              aged policy attached for the portal to function properly.

              aged policy attached for the portal to function properly.
