NAME
       list-studio-components -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the StudioComponents in a studio.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-studio-components is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: studioComponents

SYNOPSIS
            list-studio-components
          [--states <value>]
          --studio-id <value>
          [--types <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --states (list)
          Filters the request to studio components that  are  in  one  of  the
          given states.

          (string)
              The current state of the studio component resource.

              While a studio component is being created, modified, or deleted,
              its state will equal "CREATE_IN_PROGRESS", "UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS",
              or "DELETE_IN_PROGRESS"

              These are called 'transition states'.

              No modifications may be made to the studio component while it is
              in a transition state.

              If creation of the resource fails, the state will change to CRE-
              ATE_FAILED.  The resource StatusCode and StatusMessage will pro-
              vide more information of why creation failed.  The  resource  in
              this state will automatically be deleted from your account after
              a period of time.

              If updating the resource fails, the state  will  change  to  UP-
              DATE_FAILED. The resource StatusCode and StatusMessage will pro-
              vide more information of why the  update  failed.  The  resource
              will  be returned to the state it was in when the update request
              was invoked.

              If deleting  the  resource  fails,  the  state  will  change  to
              DELETE_FAILED.  The  resource  StatusCode and StatusMessage will
              provide more information of why the update failed. The  resource
              will  be returned to the state it was in when the update request
              was invoked. After the resource is deleted successfully, it will
              change to the "DELETED" state. The resource will no longer count
              against service quotas and cannot be  used  or  acted  upon  any
              futher.  It  will be removed from your account after a period of
              time.

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            CREATE_IN_PROGRESS
            READY
            UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS
            DELETE_IN_PROGRESS
            DELETED
            DELETE_FAILED
            CREATE_FAILED
            UPDATE_FAILED

       --studio-id (string)
          The studio ID.

       --types (list)
          Filters the request to studio components that  are  of  one  of  the
          given types.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            ACTIVE_DIRECTORY
            SHARED_FILE_SYSTEM
            COMPUTE_FARM
            LICENSE_SERVICE
            CUSTOM

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          The  token for the next set of results, or null if there are no more
          results.

       studioComponents -> (list)
          A collection of studio components.

          (structure)
              A studio component represents a network resource to be used by a
              studio's  users  and workflows. A typical studio contains studio
              components for each of the following: render farm, Active Direc-
              tory, licensing, and file system.

              Access  to  a studio component is managed by specifying security
              groups for the resource, as well as its endpoint.

              A studio component also has a set of initialization scripts that
              are  returned by GetLaunchProfileInitialization . These initial-
              ization scripts run on streaming sessions when they start.  They
              provide users with flexibility in controlling how the studio re-
              sources are configured on a streaming session.
