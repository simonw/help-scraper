NAME
       delete-streaming-session -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes streaming session resource.

       After  invoking this operation, use GetStreamingSession to poll the re-
       source until it transitions to a DELETED state.

       A streaming session will count against your streaming session quota un-
       til it is marked DELETED.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-streaming-session
          [--client-token <value>]
          --session-id <value>
          --studio-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. If you dont specify a client token,  the
          AWS  SDK  automatically generates a client token and uses it for the
          request to ensure idempotency.

       --session-id (string)
          The streaming session ID.

       --studio-id (string)
          The studio ID.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
