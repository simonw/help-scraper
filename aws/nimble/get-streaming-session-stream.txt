NAME
       get-streaming-session-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a StreamingSessionStream for a streaming session.

       Invoke this operation to poll the resource after invoking CreateStream-
       ingSessionStream.

       After the StreamingSessionStream changes to the state  READY,  the  url
       property  will  contain  a  stream  to  be  used with the DCV streaming
       client.

SYNOPSIS
            get-streaming-session-stream
          --session-id <value>
          --stream-id <value>
          --studio-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --session-id (string)
          The streaming session ID.

       --stream-id (string)
          The streaming session stream ID.

       --studio-id (string)
          The studio ID.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
