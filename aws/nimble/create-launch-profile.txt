OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. If you dont specify a client token,  the
          AWS  SDK  automatically generates a client token and uses it for the
          request to ensure idempotency.

       --description (string)
          The description.

       --ec2-subnet-ids (list)
          Specifies the IDs of the EC2 subnets where streaming  sessions  will
          be  accessible  from.  These  subnets must support the specified in-
          stance types.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --launch-profile-protocol-versions (list)
          The version number of the protocol that is used by the  launch  pro-
          file. The only valid version is "2021-03-31".

          (string)
              The  version  number  of the protocol that is used by the launch
              profile. The only valid version is "2021-03-31".

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --name (string)
          The name for the launch profile.

       --stream-configuration (structure)
          A configuration for a streaming session.

          clipboardMode -> (string)
              Enable or disable the use of the system clipboard  to  copy  and
              paste between the streaming session and streaming client.

          ec2InstanceTypes -> (list)
              The EC2 instance types that users can select from when launching
              a streaming session with this launch profile.

              (string)

          maxSessionLengthInMinutes -> (integer)
              The length of time, in minutes, that a streaming session can  be
              active  before  it  is  stopped or terminated. After this point,
              Nimble Studio automatically terminates or stops the session. The
              default length of time is 690 minutes, and the maximum length of
              time is 30 days.

          maxStoppedSessionLengthInMinutes -> (integer)
              Integer that determines if you can start and stop your  sessions
              and  how  long  a session can stay in the STOPPED state. The de-
              fault value is 0. The maximum value is 5760.

              If the value is missing or set  to  0,  your  sessions  cant  be
              stopped.  If  you  then  call StopStreamingSession , the session
              fails. If the time that a session stays in the READY  state  ex-
              ceeds  the maxSessionLengthInMinutes value, the session will au-
              tomatically be terminated by AWS (instead of stopped).

              If the value is set to a positive number,  the  session  can  be
              stopped.  You  can call StopStreamingSession to stop sessions in
              the READY state. If the time that a session stays in  the  READY
              state  exceeds  the maxSessionLengthInMinutes value, the session
              will automatically be stopped by AWS (instead of terminated).

          sessionStorage -> (structure)
              (Optional) The upload storage for a streaming  workstation  that
              is created using this launch profile.

              root -> (structure)
                 The configuration for the upload storage root of the  stream-
                 ing session.

                     The folder path in Linux workstations where files are up-
                     loaded.

                 windows -> (string)

                     uploaded.

          streamingImageIds -> (list)
              The streaming images that users can select from when launching a
              streaming session with this launch profile.

            "ec2InstanceTypes": ["g4dn.xlarge"|"g4dn.2xlarge"|"g4dn.4xlarge"|"g4dn.8xlarge"|"g4dn.12xlarge"|"g4dn.16xlarge", ...],
            "maxSessionLengthInMinutes": integer,

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
