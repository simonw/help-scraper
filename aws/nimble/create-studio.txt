CREATE-STUDIO()                                                CREATE-STUDIO()



NAME
       create-studio -

DESCRIPTION
       Create a new Studio.

       When  creating a Studio, two IAM roles must be provided: the admin role
       and the user Role. These roles are assumed by your users when they  log
       in to the Nimble Studio portal.

       The  user role must have the AmazonNimbleStudio-StudioUser managed pol-
       icy attached for the portal to function properly.

       The Admin Role must  have  the  AmazonNimbleStudio-StudioAdmin  managed
       policy attached for the portal to function properly.

       You  may optionally specify a KMS key in the StudioEncryptionConfigura-
       tion.

       In Nimble Studio, resource names, descriptions, initialization scripts,
       and  other  data  you provide are always encrypted at rest using an KMS
       key. By default, this key is owned by Amazon Web Services  and  managed
       on  your behalf. You may provide your own KMS key when calling CreateS-
       tudio to encrypt this data using a key you own and manage.

       When providing an KMS key during studio creation, Nimble Studio creates
       KMS  grants in your account to provide your studio user and admin roles
       access to these KMS keys.

       If you delete this grant, the studio will no longer  be  accessible  to
       your portal users.

       If  you delete the studio KMS key, your studio will no longer be acces-
       sible.

OPTIONS
       --admin-role-arn (string)
          The IAM role that Studio Admins will assume when logging in  to  the
          Nimble Studio portal.

       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. If you dont specify a client token,  the
          AWS  SDK  automatically generates a client token and uses it for the
          request to ensure idempotency.

       --display-name (string)
          A friendly name for the studio.

       --studio-encryption-configuration (structure)
          The studio encryption configuration.

          keyArn -> (string)
              The ARN for a KMS key that is used to encrypt studio data.

          keyType -> (string)
              The type of KMS key that is used to encrypt studio data.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          keyArn=string,keyType=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "keyArn": "string",
            "keyType": "AWS_OWNED_KEY"|"CUSTOMER_MANAGED_KEY"
          }

       --studio-name (string)
          The studio name that is used in the URL of the Nimble Studio  portal
          when accessed by Nimble Studio users.

       --tags (map)
          A  collection  of labels, in the form of key:value pairs, that apply
          to this resource.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --user-role-arn (string)
          The IAM role that Studio Users will assume when logging  in  to  the
          Nimble Studio portal.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
