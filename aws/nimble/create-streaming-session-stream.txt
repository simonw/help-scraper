NAME
       create-streaming-session-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a streaming session stream for a streaming session.

       After  invoking this API, invoke GetStreamingSessionStream with the re-
       turned streamId to poll the resource until it is in state READY.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-streaming-session-stream
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--expiration-in-seconds <value>]
          --session-id <value>
          --studio-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency  of the request. If you dont specify a client token, the
          AWS SDK automatically generates a client token and uses it  for  the
          request to ensure idempotency.

       --expiration-in-seconds (integer)
          The expiration time in seconds.

       --session-id (string)
          The streaming session ID.

       --studio-id (string)
          The studio ID.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       stream -> (structure)
          The stream.

          createdAt -> (timestamp)
              The  Unix  epoch  timestamp in seconds for when the resource was
              created.

          createdBy -> (string)

          expiresAt -> (timestamp)
              The  Unix  epoch  timestamp in seconds for when the resource ex-
              pires.

          ownedBy -> (string)
              The user ID of the user that owns  the  streaming  session.  The

              The current state.

          statusCode -> (string)
              The streaming session stream status code.

          streamId -> (string)
