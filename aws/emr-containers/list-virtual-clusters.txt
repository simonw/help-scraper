LIST-VIRTUAL-CLUSTERS()                                LIST-VIRTUAL-CLUSTERS()



NAME
       list-virtual-clusters -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  information about the specified virtual cluster. Virtual cluster
       is a managed entity on Amazon EMR on EKS.  You  can  create,  describe,
       list  and  delete  virtual clusters. They do not consume any additional
       resource in your system. A single virtual cluster maps to a single  Ku-
       bernetes  namespace.  Given  this  relationship,  you can model virtual
       clusters the same way you model Kubernetes namespaces to meet your  re-
       quirements.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-virtual-clusters  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: virtualClusters

SYNOPSIS
            list-virtual-clusters
          [--container-provider-id <value>]
          [--container-provider-type <value>]
          [--created-after <value>]
          [--created-before <value>]
          [--states <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --container-provider-id (string)
          The container provider ID of the virtual cluster.

       --container-provider-type (string)
          The container provider type of the virtual cluster. EKS is the  only
          supported type as of now.

          Possible values:

          o EKS

       --created-after (timestamp)
          The date and time after which the virtual clusters are created.

       --created-before (timestamp)
          The date and time before which the virtual clusters are created.

       --states (list)
          The states of the requested virtual clusters.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            RUNNING
            TERMINATING
            TERMINATED
            ARRESTED

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       virtualClusters -> (list)
          This output lists the specified virtual clusters.

          (structure)
              This  entity describes a virtual cluster. A virtual cluster is a
              Kubernetes namespace that Amazon EMR is registered with.  Amazon
              EMR uses virtual clusters to run jobs and host endpoints. Multi-
              ple virtual clusters can be backed by the same physical cluster.
              However,  each  virtual  cluster maps to one namespace on an EKS
              cluster. Virtual clusters do not  create  any  active  resources
              that  contribute  to your bill or that require lifecycle manage-
              ment outside the service.

              id -> (string)
                 The ID of the virtual cluster.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the virtual cluster.

              arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the virtual cluster.

              state -> (string)
                 The state of the virtual cluster.

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of the container provider. EKS is the only  sup-
                     ported type as of now.

                 id -> (string)
                     The ID of the container cluster.

                 info -> (structure)
                     The information about the container cluster.

                     eksInfo -> (structure)
                        The information about the EKS cluster.

                        namespace -> (string)
                            The namespaces of the EKS cluster.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the virtual cluster is created.

              tags -> (map)
                 The assigned tags of the virtual cluster.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          This output displays the token for the next set of virtual clusters.
