NAME
       describe-managed-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Displays  detailed information about a managed endpoint. A managed end-
       point is a gateway that connects EMR Studio to Amazon  EMR  on  EKS  so
       that EMR Studio can communicate with your virtual cluster.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-managed-endpoint
          --id <value>
          --virtual-cluster-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          This output displays ID of the managed endpoint.

       --virtual-cluster-id (string)
          The ID of the endpoint's virtual cluster.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                            nested  configurations. A classification refers to
                            an application-specific configuration file.  Prop-
