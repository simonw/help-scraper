LIST-USAGE-FOR-LICENSE-CONFIGURATION()  LIST-USAGE-FOR-LICENSE-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       list-usage-for-license-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all license usage records for a license configuration, displaying
       license consumption details by resource at a selected  point  in  time.
       Use  this  action  to audit the current license consumption for any li-
       cense inventory and configuration.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-usage-for-license-configuration is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: LicenseConfigurationUsageList

SYNOPSIS
            list-usage-for-license-configuration
          --license-configuration-arn <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --license-configuration-arn (string)
          Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the license configuration.

       --filters (list)
          Filters  to scope the results. The following filters and logical op-
          erators are supported:

          o resourceArn - The ARN of the license configuration resource. Logi-
            cal operators are EQUALS | NOT_EQUALS .

          o resourceType  -  The  resource  type  (EC2_INSTANCE  |  EC2_HOST |
            EC2_AMI | SYSTEMS_MANAGER_MANAGED_INSTANCE  ).  Logical  operators
            are EQUALS | NOT_EQUALS .

          o resourceAccount  -  The  ID of the account that owns the resource.
            Logical operators are EQUALS | NOT_EQUALS .

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to  return  more  spe-
              cific  results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to
              match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, at-
              tributes, or IDs.

              Name -> (string)
                 Name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 Filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the licenses in use for a license configuration

       The following list-usage-for-license-configuration example lists infor-
       mation  about  the  resources  using licenses for the specified license
       configuration. For example, if the license type is vCPU, any  instances
       consume one license per vCPU.

          aws license-manager list-usage-for-license-configuration \
              --license-configuration-arn arn:aws:license-manager:us-west-2:123456789012:license-configuration:lic-38b658717b87478aaa7c00883EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "LicenseConfigurationUsageList": [

                      "ResourceArn": "arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/i-04a636d18e83cfacb",
                      "ResourceType": "EC2_INSTANCE",
                      "ResourceStatus": "running",
                      "ResourceOwnerId": "123456789012",
                      "AssociationTime": 1570892850.519,
                      "ConsumedLicenses": 2
                  }
              ]
          }
