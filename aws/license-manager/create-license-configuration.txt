CREATE-LICENSE-CONFIGURATION()                  CREATE-LICENSE-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       create-license-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a license configuration.

       A  license configuration is an abstraction of a customer license agree-
       ment that can be consumed and enforced by License  Manager.  Components
       include  specifications  for  the  license type (licensing by instance,
       socket, CPU, or vCPU), allowed tenancy (shared tenancy,  Dedicated  In-
       stance, Dedicated Host, or all of these), license affinity to host (how
       long a license must be associated with a host), and the number  of  li-
       censes purchased and used.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Name of the license configuration.

       --description (string)
          Description of the license configuration.

       --license-counting-type (string)
          Dimension used to track the license inventory.

          ing a hard limit blocks the launch of new instances.

       --license-rules (list)
          License rules. The syntax is #name=value (for  example,  #allowedTe-

              ProductInformationFilterList -> (list)
                 A Product information filter consists  of  a  ProductInforma-
                 tionFilterComparator  which is a logical operator, a Product-
                 InformationFilterName which specifies the type of filter  be-
                 ing declared, and a ProductInformationFilterValue that speci-
                 fies the value to filter on.

                 Accepted values for ProductInformationFilterName  are  listed
                 here along with descriptions and valid options for ProductIn-
                 formationFilterComparator .

                 The following filters and are  supported  when  the  resource
                 type is SSM_MANAGED :

                 o Application Name - The name of the application. Logical op-
                   erator is EQUALS .

                   Logical operator is EQUALS .

                 o Application Version - The version of the application. Logi-
                   cal operator is EQUALS .

                   must   be   appended   to   Tag:   following  the  example:
                   Tag:name-of-your-key . ProductInformationFilterValue is op-

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ResourceType": "string",
              "ProductInformationFilterList": [
                {
                  "ProductInformationFilterName": "string",
                  "ProductInformationFilterValue": ["string", ...],
                  "ProductInformationFilterComparator": "string"

              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To create a license configuration

       The  following  create-license-configuration  example creates a license
       configuration with a hard limit of 10 cores.

          aws license-manager create-license-configuration --name my-license-configuration \
              --license-counting-type Core \
              --license-count 10 \
              --license-count-hard-limit

       Output:

          {
            "LicenseConfigurationArn": "arn:aws:license-manager:us-west-2:123456789012:license-configuration:lic-6eb6586f508a786a2ba41EXAMPLE1111"
          }

       Example 2: To create a license configuration

       The following create-license-configuration example  creates  a  license
       configuration  with a soft limit of 100 vCPUs. It uses a rule to enable
       vCPU optimization.

          aws license-manager create-license-configuration --name my-license-configuration
              --license-counting-type vCPU \
              --license-count 100 \
              --license-rules "#honorVcpuOptimization=true"

       Output:

          {
            "LicenseConfigurationArn": "arn:aws:license-manager:us-west-2:123456789012:license-configuration:lic-6eb6586f508a786a2ba41EXAMPLE2222"
          }

OUTPUT
       LicenseConfigurationArn -> (string)
          Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the license configuration.
