LIST-ASSOCIATIONS-FOR-LICENSE-CONLIST-ASSOCIATIONS-FOR-LICENSE-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       list-associations-for-license-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  resource  associations for the specified license configura-
       tion.

       Resource associations need not consume licenses from a license configu-
       ration.  For  example, an AMI or a stopped instance might not consume a
       license (depending on the license rules).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-associations-for-license-configuration is a  paginated  operation.
       Multiple  API  calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data
       set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the  --no-pagi-
       nate  argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a
       paginated response, the --query argument must extract data from the re-
       sults  of the following query expressions: LicenseConfigurationAssocia-
       tions

SYNOPSIS
            list-associations-for-license-configuration
          --license-configuration-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --license-configuration-arn (string)
          Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a license configuration.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get associations for a license configuration

       The following list-associations-for-license-configuration example  dis-
       plays  detailed  information  for the associations of the specified li-
       cense configuration.

                      "ResourceArn": "arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2::image/ami-1234567890abcdef0",
                      "ResourceType": "EC2_AMI",
                      "ResourceOwnerId": "123456789012",
                      "AssociationTime": 1568825118.617
                  },
                  {
                      "ResourceArn": "arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2::image/ami-0abcdef1234567890",
                      "ResourceType": "EC2_AMI",
                      "ResourceOwnerId": "123456789012",
                      "AssociationTime": 1568825118.946
                  }
              ]
          }
