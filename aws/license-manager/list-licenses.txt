OPTIONS
       --license-arns (list)
          Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the licenses.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          Filters to scope the results. The following filters are supported:

          o Beneficiary

          o ProductSKU

          o Fingerprint

          o Status

          (structure)
              A  filter  name  and value pair that is used to return more spe-
              cific results from a describe operation. Filters can be used  to
              match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, at-
              tributes, or IDs.

              Name -> (string)
                 Name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 Filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --next-token (string)
          Token for the next set of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Maximum number of results to return in a single call.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
