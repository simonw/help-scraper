SYNOPSIS
            list-received-grants
          [--grant-arns <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]

OPTIONS
       --grant-arns (list)
          Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the grants.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          Filters to scope the results. The following filters are supported:

          o ProductSKU

          o LicenseIssuerName

          o LicenseArn

          o GrantStatus

          o GranterAccountId

          (structure)
              A  filter  name  and value pair that is used to return more spe-
              cific results from a describe operation. Filters can be used  to
              match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, at-
              tributes, or IDs.

              Name -> (string)
                 Name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 Filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --next-token (string)
          Token for the next set of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Maximum number of results to return in a single call.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
