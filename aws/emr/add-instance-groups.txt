NAME
       add-instance-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds an instance group to a running cluster.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            add-instance-groups
          --cluster-id <value>
          --instance-groups <value> [<value>...]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-id (string)
          A  unique  string that identifies a cluster. The create-cluster com-
          mand returns this identifier. You can use the list-clusters  command
          to get cluster IDs.

       --instance-groups (list)
          Specifies  the number and type of Amazon EC2 instances to create for
          each node type in a cluster, using uniform instance groups. You  can
          specify  either --instance-groups or --instance-fleets but not both.
          For more information, see the following topic in the EMR  Management
          Guide:

          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-instance-group-configuration.html

          You can specify arguments individually using multiple InstanceGroup-
          Type  argument  blocks, one for the MASTER instance group, one for a
          CORE instance group, and optional, multiple TASK instance groups.

          If you specify inline JSON structures, enclose the entire  Instance-
          GroupType argument block in single quotation marks.

          Each  InstanceGroupType  block takes the following inline arguments.
          Optional arguments are shown in [square brackets].

          o [Name] - An optional friendly name for the instance group.

          o InstanceGroupType - MASTER , CORE , or TASK .

          o InstanceType - The type of EC2 instance, for example m4.large , to
            use for all nodes in the instance group.

          o InstanceCount  -  The  number of EC2 instances to provision in the
            instance group.

          o [BidPrice] - If specified, indicates that the instance group  uses
            Spot  Instances.  This is the maximum price you are willing to pay
            for Spot Instances. Specify OnDemandPrice to set the amount  equal
            to the On-Demand price, or specify an amount in USD.

          o [EbsConfiguration]  - Specifies additional Amazon EBS storage vol-
            umes attached to EC2 instances using an inline JSON structure.

          o [AutoScalingPolicy] - Specifies an automatic  scaling  policy  for
            the instance group using an inline JSON structure.
