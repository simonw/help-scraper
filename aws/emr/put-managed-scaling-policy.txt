PUT-MANAGED-SCALING-POLICY()                      PUT-MANAGED-SCALING-POLICY()



NAME
       put-managed-scaling-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  or updates a managed scaling policy for an Amazon EMR cluster.
       The managed scaling policy defines the limits for  resources,  such  as
       EC2  instances that can be added or terminated from a cluster. The pol-
       icy only applies to the core and task nodes. The master node cannot  be
       scaled after initial configuration.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-managed-scaling-policy
          --cluster-id <value>
          --managed-scaling-policy <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-id (string)
          Specifies  the ID of an EMR cluster where the managed scaling policy
          is attached.

       --managed-scaling-policy (structure)
          Specifies the constraints for the managed scaling policy.

          ComputeLimits -> (structure)
              The EC2 unit limits for a managed scaling  policy.  The  managed
              scaling  activity of a cluster is not allowed to go above or be-
              low these limits. The limit only applies to the  core  and  task
              nodes. The master node cannot be scaled after initial configura-
              tion.

              UnitType -> (string)
                 The unit type used for specifying a managed scaling policy.

              MinimumCapacityUnits -> (integer)
                 The lower boundary of EC2 units. It is measured through  vCPU
                 cores  or  instances for instance groups and measured through
                 units for instance fleets. Managed scaling activities are not
                 allowed  beyond  this boundary. The limit only applies to the
                 core and task nodes. The master node cannot be  scaled  after
                 initial configuration.

              MaximumCapacityUnits -> (integer)
                 The  upper boundary of EC2 units. It is measured through vCPU
                 cores or instances for instance groups and  measured  through
                 units for instance fleets. Managed scaling activities are not
                 allowed beyond this boundary. The limit only applies  to  the
                 core  and  task nodes. The master node cannot be scaled after
                 initial configuration.

              MaximumOnDemandCapacityUnits -> (integer)
                 The upper boundary of On-Demand EC2  units.  It  is  measured
                 through  vCPU cores or instances for instance groups and mea-
                 sured through units for instance fleets. The On-Demand  units
                 are  not allowed to scale beyond this boundary. The parameter
                 is used to split capacity allocation  between  On-Demand  and
                 Spot Instances.

              MaximumCoreCapacityUnits -> (integer)
                 The upper boundary of EC2 units for core node type in a clus-
                 ter. It is measured through vCPU cores or instances  for  in-
                 stance groups and measured through units for instance fleets.
                 The core units are not allowed to scale beyond this boundary.
                 The  parameter  is  used to split capacity allocation between
                 core and task nodes.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ComputeLimits={UnitType=string,MinimumCapacityUnits=integer,MaximumCapacityUnits=integer,MaximumOnDemandCapacityUnits=integer,MaximumCoreCapacityUnits=integer}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ComputeLimits": {
              "UnitType": "InstanceFleetUnits"|"Instances"|"VCPU",
              "MinimumCapacityUnits": integer,
              "MaximumCapacityUnits": integer,
              "MaximumOnDemandCapacityUnits": integer,
              "MaximumCoreCapacityUnits": integer
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
