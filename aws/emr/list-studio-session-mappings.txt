NAME
       list-studio-session-mappings -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of all user or group session mappings for the Amazon EMR
       Studio specified by StudioId .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-studio-session-mappings is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: SessionMappings

SYNOPSIS
            list-studio-session-mappings
          [--studio-id <value>]
          [--identity-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --studio-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon EMR Studio.

       --identity-type (string)
          Specifies whether to return session mappings for users or groups. If
          not specified, the results include session mapping details for  both
          users and groups.

          Possible values:

          o USER

          o GROUP

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              IdentityType -> (string)
                 Specifies whether the identity mapped to the Amazon EMR  Stu-

              SessionPolicyArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the session policy associ-
