LIST-INSTANCE-FLEETS()                                  LIST-INSTANCE-FLEETS()



NAME
       list-instance-fleets -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all available details about the instance fleets in a cluster.

       NOTE:
          The  instance  fleet  configuration  is available only in Amazon EMR
          versions 4.8.0 and later, excluding 5.0.x versions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-instance-fleets is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: InstanceFleets

SYNOPSIS
            list-instance-fleets
          --cluster-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the cluster.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       InstanceFleets -> (list)
          The list of instance fleets for the cluster and given filters.

          (structure)
              Describes  an  instance fleet, which is a group of EC2 instances
              that host a particular node type (master, core, or task)  in  an
              Amazon  EMR cluster. Instance fleets can consist of a mix of in-
              stance types and On-Demand and Spot Instances, which are  provi-
              sioned to meet a defined target capacity.

              NOTE:
                 The  instance fleet configuration is available only in Amazon
                 EMR versions 4.8.0 and later, excluding 5.0.x versions.

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the instance fleet.

              Name -> (string)
                 A friendly name for the instance fleet.

              Status -> (structure)
                 The current status of the instance fleet.

                 State -> (string)
                     A code representing the instance fleet status.

                     o PROVISIONING The instance fleet is provisioning EC2 re-
                       sources and is not yet ready to run jobs.

                     o BOOTSTRAPPING  EC2  instances  and other resources have
                       been provisioned and the  bootstrap  actions  specified
                       for the instances are underway.

                     o RUNNING  EC2 instances and other resources are running.
                       They are either executing jobs or  waiting  to  execute
                       jobs.

                     o RESIZING  A resize operation is underway. EC2 instances
                       are either being added or removed.

                     o SUSPENDED A resize operation could not complete. Exist-
                       ing  EC2  instances are running, but instances can't be
                       added or removed.

                     o TERMINATING The instance fleet is terminating  EC2  in-
                       stances.

                     o TERMINATED  The instance fleet is no longer active, and
                       all EC2 instances have been terminated.

                 StateChangeReason -> (structure)
                     Provides status change reason details  for  the  instance
                     fleet.

                     Code -> (string)
                        A  code  corresponding  to the reason the state change
                        occurred.

                     Message -> (string)
                        An explanatory message.

                 Timeline -> (structure)
                     Provides historical timestamps for  the  instance  fleet,
                     including  the time of creation, the time it became ready
                     to run jobs, and the time of termination.

                     CreationDateTime -> (timestamp)
                        The time and date the instance fleet was created.

                     ReadyDateTime -> (timestamp)
                        The time and date the instance fleet was ready to  run
                        jobs.

                     EndDateTime -> (timestamp)
                        The time and date the instance fleet terminated.

              InstanceFleetType -> (string)
                 The node type that the instance fleet hosts. Valid values are
                 MASTER, CORE, or TASK.

              TargetOnDemandCapacity -> (integer)
                 The target capacity  of  On-Demand  units  for  the  instance
                 fleet,  which determines how many On-Demand Instances to pro-
                 vision. When the instance fleet launches, Amazon EMR tries to
                 provision  On-Demand Instances as specified by  InstanceType-
                 Config . Each instance configuration has a specified  Weight-
                 edCapacity  .  When an On-Demand Instance is provisioned, the
                 WeightedCapacity units count toward the target capacity. Ama-
                 zon EMR provisions instances until the target capacity is to-
                 tally fulfilled, even if this results in an overage. For  ex-
                 ample,  if  there  are 2 units remaining to fulfill capacity,
                 and Amazon EMR can only provision an instance with a  Weight-
                 edCapacity  of  5 units, the instance is provisioned, and the
                 target capacity is exceeded by 3  units.  You  can  use   In-
                 stanceFleet$ProvisionedOnDemandCapacity to determine the Spot
                 capacity units that have been provisioned  for  the  instance
                 fleet.

                 NOTE:
                     If  not  specified  or  set to 0, only Spot Instances are
                     provisioned for the instance fleet using TargetSpotCapac-
                     ity  . At least one of TargetSpotCapacity and TargetOnDe-
                     mandCapacity should be greater than 0. For a  master  in-
                     stance  fleet,  only one of TargetSpotCapacity and Targe-
                     tOnDemandCapacity can be specified, and its value must be
                     1.

              TargetSpotCapacity -> (integer)
                 The  target  capacity  of  Spot units for the instance fleet,
                 which determines how many Spot Instances to  provision.  When
                 the  instance  fleet  launches, Amazon EMR tries to provision
                 Spot Instances as specified by  InstanceTypeConfig . Each in-
                 stance  configuration has a specified WeightedCapacity . When
                 a Spot instance is provisioned,  the  WeightedCapacity  units
                 count  toward  the target capacity. Amazon EMR provisions in-
                 stances until the target capacity is totally fulfilled,  even
                 if  this  results  in an overage. For example, if there are 2
                 units remaining to fulfill capacity, and Amazon EMR can  only
                 provision an instance with a WeightedCapacity of 5 units, the
                 instance is provisioned, and the target capacity is  exceeded
                 by  3 units. You can use  InstanceFleet$ProvisionedSpotCapac-
                 ity to determine the Spot capacity units that have been  pro-
                 visioned for the instance fleet.

                 NOTE:
                     If  not  specified  or set to 0, only On-Demand Instances
                     are provisioned for the instance fleet. At least  one  of
                     TargetSpotCapacity  and  TargetOnDemandCapacity should be
                     greater than 0. For a master instance fleet, only one  of
                     TargetSpotCapacity   and  TargetOnDemandCapacity  can  be
                     specified, and its value must be 1.

              ProvisionedOnDemandCapacity -> (integer)
                 The number of On-Demand units that have been provisioned  for
                 the  instance  fleet to fulfill TargetOnDemandCapacity . This
                 provisioned capacity might  be  less  than  or  greater  than
                 TargetOnDemandCapacity .

              ProvisionedSpotCapacity -> (integer)
                 The  number of Spot units that have been provisioned for this
                 instance fleet to fulfill TargetSpotCapacity  .  This  provi-
                 sioned  capacity  might  be  less  than  or greater than Tar-
                 getSpotCapacity .

              InstanceTypeSpecifications -> (list)
                 An array of specifications for the instance types  that  com-
                 prise an instance fleet.

                 (structure)
                     The configuration specification for each instance type in
                     an instance fleet.

                     NOTE:
                        The instance fleet configuration is available only  in
                        Amazon  EMR  versions 4.8.0 and later, excluding 5.0.x
                        versions.

                     InstanceType -> (string)
                        The EC2 instance type, for example m3.xlarge .

                     WeightedCapacity -> (integer)
                        The number of units that  a  provisioned  instance  of
                        this type provides toward fulfilling the target capac-
                        ities defined in  InstanceFleetConfig . Capacity  val-
                        ues  represent performance characteristics such as vC-
                        PUs, memory, or I/O. If  not  specified,  the  default
                        value is 1.

                     BidPrice -> (string)
                        The  bid  price for each EC2 Spot Instance type as de-
                        fined by InstanceType . Expressed in USD.

                     BidPriceAsPercentageOfOnDemandPrice -> (double)
                        The bid price, as a percentage of On-Demand price, for
                        each  EC2  Spot  Instance as defined by InstanceType .
                        Expressed as a number (for example, 20 specifies 20%).

                     Configurations -> (list)
                        A configuration classification that applies when  pro-
                        visioning cluster instances, which can include config-
                        urations for applications and  software  bundled  with
                        Amazon EMR.

                        (structure)

                            NOTE:
                               Amazon EMR releases 4.x or later.

                            An optional configuration specification to be used
                            when provisioning cluster instances, which can in-
                            clude configurations for applications and software
                            bundled with Amazon EMR. A configuration  consists
                            of  a  classification,  properties,  and  optional
                            nested configurations. A classification refers  to
                            an  application-specific configuration file. Prop-
                            erties are the settings you want to change in that
                            file. For more information, see Configuring Appli-
                            cations .

                            Classification -> (string)
                               The classification within a configuration.

                            Configurations -> (list)
                               A list of additional  configurations  to  apply
                               within a configuration object.

                                      Amazon EMR releases 4.x or later.

                                   An  optional configuration specification to
                                   be  used  when  provisioning  cluster   in-
                                   stances,  which  can include configurations
                                   for applications and software bundled  with
                                   Amazon  EMR.  A configuration consists of a
                                   classification,  properties,  and  optional
                                   nested   configurations.  A  classification
                                   refers to an application-specific  configu-
                                   ration  file.  Properties  are the settings
                                   you want to change in that file.  For  more
                                   information, see Configuring Applications .

                            ciated with the instance group.

                            VolumeSpecification -> (structure)
                               EBS  volume specifications such as volume type,
                               IOPS, size (GiB) and  throughput  (MiB/s)  that
                               are requested for the EBS volume attached to an
                               EC2 instance in the cluster.

                               VolumeType -> (string)
                                   The volume type. Volume types supported are
                                   gp2, io1, and standard.

                               Iops -> (integer)
                                   The  number  of  I/O  operations per second
                                   (IOPS) that the volume supports.

                                   The volume size, in gibibytes  (GiB).  This
                                   can  be a number from 1 - 1024. If the vol-
                                   ume  type  is  EBS-optimized,  the  minimum
                                   value is 10.

                               Throughput -> (integer)
                                   The  throughput,  in  mebibyte  per  second
                                   (MiB/s). This optional parameter can  be  a
                                   number  from  125  - 1000 and is valid only
                                   for gp3 volumes.

                            Device -> (string)
                               The device name that  is  exposed  to  the  in-
                               stance, such as /dev/sdh.

                     EbsOptimized -> (boolean)
                        Evaluates  to  TRUE when the specified InstanceType is
                        EBS-optimized.

                     CustomAmiId -> (string)
                        The custom AMI ID to use for the instance type.

              LaunchSpecifications -> (structure)
                 Describes the launch specification for an instance fleet.

                 SpotSpecification -> (structure)
                     The launch specification for Spot Instances in the fleet,
                     which determines the defined duration, provisioning time-
                     out behavior, and allocation strategy.

                     TimeoutDurationMinutes -> (integer)
                        The spot provisioning timeout period  in  minutes.  If
                        Spot  Instances  are  not provisioned within this time
                        period, the TimeOutAction is taken. Minimum value is 5
                        and  maximum  value  is 1440. The timeout applies only
                        during initial provisioning, when the cluster is first
                        created.

                     TimeoutAction -> (string)
                        The  action  to  take  when TargetSpotCapacity has not
                        been fulfilled when the TimeoutDurationMinutes has ex-
                        pired;  that  is, when all Spot Instances could not be
                        provisioned  within  the  Spot  provisioning  timeout.
                        Valid     values     are     TERMINATE_CLUSTER     and
                        SWITCH_TO_ON_DEMAND  .  SWITCH_TO_ON_DEMAND  specifies
                        that if no Spot Instances are available, On-Demand In-
                        stances should be provisioned to fulfill any remaining
                        Spot capacity.

                     BlockDurationMinutes -> (integer)
                        The defined duration for Spot Instances (also known as
                        Spot blocks) in minutes. When specified, the Spot  In-
                        stance  does not terminate before the defined duration
                        expires, and defined duration  pricing  for  Spot  In-
                        stances  applies.  Valid values are 60, 120, 180, 240,
                        300, or 360. The duration period starts as soon  as  a
                        Spot  Instance receives its instance ID. At the end of
                        the duration, Amazon EC2 marks the Spot  Instance  for
                        termination  and  provides a Spot Instance termination
                        notice, which gives the instance a two-minute  warning
                        before it terminates.

                        NOTE:
                            Spot Instances with a defined duration (also known
                            as Spot blocks) are no  longer  available  to  new
                            customers  from  July  1,  2021. For customers who
                            have previously used the feature, we will continue
                            to  support Spot Instances with a defined duration
                            until December 31, 2022.

                     AllocationStrategy -> (string)
                        Specifies the strategy to use in  launching  Spot  In-
                        stance  fleets.  Currently,  the only option is capac-
                        ity-optimized (the default), which launches  instances
                        from Spot Instance pools with optimal capacity for the
                        number of instances that are launching.

                 OnDemandSpecification -> (structure)
                     The launch specification for On-Demand Instances  in  the
                     instance fleet, which determines the allocation strategy.

                     NOTE:
                        The  instance fleet configuration is available only in
                        Amazon EMR versions 4.8.0 and later,  excluding  5.0.x
                        versions.  On-Demand  Instances allocation strategy is
                        available in Amazon EMR version 5.12.1 and later.

                     AllocationStrategy -> (string)
                        Specifies the strategy to use in  launching  On-Demand
                        instance  fleets.  Currently,  the only option is low-
                        est-price (the default),  which  launches  the  lowest
                        price first.

                     CapacityReservationOptions -> (structure)
                        The  launch  specification  for On-Demand instances in
                        the instance fleet, which  determines  the  allocation
                        strategy.

                        UsageStrategy -> (string)
                            Indicates  whether to use unused Capacity Reserva-
                            tions for fulfilling On-Demand capacity.

                            If you specify  use-capacity-reservations-first  ,
                            the  fleet  uses  unused  Capacity Reservations to
                            fulfill On-Demand capacity up to the target On-De-
                            mand capacity. If multiple instance pools have un-
                            used Capacity Reservations, the On-Demand  alloca-
                            tion  strategy  (lowest-price ) is applied. If the
                            number of unused  Capacity  Reservations  is  less
                            than  the On-Demand target capacity, the remaining
                            On-Demand target capacity is launched according to
                            the On-Demand allocation strategy (lowest-price ).

                            If  you do not specify a value, the fleet fulfills
                            the On-Demand capacity  according  to  the  chosen
                            On-Demand allocation strategy.

                        CapacityReservationPreference -> (string)
                            Indicates   the  instance's  Capacity  Reservation
                            preferences. Possible preferences include:

                            o open - The instance can run in any open Capacity
                              Reservation  that  has  matching attributes (in-
                              stance type, platform, Availability Zone).

                            o none - The instance avoids running in a Capacity
                              Reservation  even  if  one is available. The in-
                              stance runs as an On-Demand Instance.

                        CapacityReservationResourceGroupArn -> (string)
                            The ARN of the Capacity Reservation resource group
                            in which to run the instance.

       Marker -> (string)
          The  pagination  token that indicates the next set of results to re-
          trieve.
