PUT-AUTO-SCALING-POLICY()                            PUT-AUTO-SCALING-POLICY()



NAME
       put-auto-scaling-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  or  updates  an  automatic  scaling policy for a core instance
       group or task instance group in an Amazon EMR  cluster.  The  automatic
       scaling  policy defines how an instance group dynamically adds and ter-
       minates Amazon EC2 instances in response to the value of  a  CloudWatch
       metric.

OPTIONS
       --cluster-id (string)
          Specifies the ID of a cluster. The instance group to which the auto-
          matic scaling policy is applied is within this cluster.

       --instance-group-id (string)
          Specifies the ID of the instance group to which the automatic  scal-
          ing policy is applied.

       --auto-scaling-policy (structure)
          Specifies the definition of the automatic scaling policy.

          Constraints -> (structure)
              The  upper and lower Amazon EC2 instance limits for an automatic
              scaling policy. Automatic scaling activity will not cause an in-
              stance group to grow above or below these limits.

              MinCapacity -> (integer)
                 The  lower  boundary  of  Amazon EC2 instances in an instance
                 group below which  scaling  activities  are  not  allowed  to
                 shrink.  Scale-in activities will not terminate instances be-
                 low this boundary.

              MaxCapacity -> (integer)
                 The upper boundary of Amazon EC2  instances  in  an  instance
                 group  beyond  which  scaling  activities  are not allowed to
                 grow. Scale-out activities will not add instances beyond this
                 boundary.

          Rules -> (list)
              The  scale-in  and  scale-out  rules that comprise the automatic
              scaling policy.

              (structure)
                 A scale-in or scale-out rule that defines  scaling  activity,
                 including the CloudWatch metric alarm that triggers activity,
                 how Amazon EC2 instances are added or removed, and the  peri-
                 odicity  of  adjustments. The automatic scaling policy for an
                 instance group can comprise one  or  more  automatic  scaling
                 rules.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name used to identify an automatic scaling rule. Rule
                     names must be unique within a scaling policy.

                 Description -> (string)
                     A friendly, more verbose  description  of  the  automatic
                     scaling rule.

                 Action -> (structure)
                     The  conditions  that trigger an automatic scaling activ-
                     ity.

                     Market -> (string)
                        Not available for instance groups. Instance groups use
                        the market type specified for the group.

                     SimpleScalingPolicyConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The  type of adjustment the automatic scaling activity
                        makes when triggered, and the periodicity of  the  ad-
                        justment.

                        AdjustmentType -> (string)
                            The  way  in  which Amazon EC2 instances are added
                            (if ScalingAdjustment is  a  positive  number)  or
                            terminated  (if  ScalingAdjustment  is  a negative
                            number) each time the scaling  activity  is  trig-
                            gered.    CHANGE_IN_CAPACITY   is   the   default.
                            CHANGE_IN_CAPACITY indicates that the  Amazon  EC2
                            instance count increments or decrements by Scalin-
                            gAdjustment , which should be expressed as an  in-
                            teger.  PERCENT_CHANGE_IN_CAPACITY  indicates  the
                            instance count increments  or  decrements  by  the
                            percentage  specified by ScalingAdjustment , which
                            should be expressed as an integer. For example, 20
                            indicates an increase in 20% increments of cluster
                            capacity. EXACT_CAPACITY indicates the scaling ac-
                            tivity  results in an instance group with the num-
                            ber of Amazon EC2 instances specified  by  Scalin-
                            gAdjustment , which should be expressed as a posi-
                            tive integer.

                        ScalingAdjustment -> (integer)
                            The amount by which to  scale  in  or  scale  out,
                            based on the specified AdjustmentType . A positive
                            value adds to the instance group's Amazon EC2  in-
                            stance  count  while a negative number removes in-
                            stances. If AdjustmentType is set to  EXACT_CAPAC-
                            ITY  ,  the number should only be a positive inte-
                            ger.   If   AdjustmentType   is   set   to    PER-
                            CENT_CHANGE_IN_CAPACITY , the value should express
                            the percentage as an integer. For example, -20 in-
                            dicates  a  decrease  in 20% increments of cluster
                            capacity.

                        CoolDown -> (integer)
                            The amount of time, in seconds,  after  a  scaling
                            activity  completes before any further trigger-re-
                            lated scaling activities can  start.  The  default
                            value is 0.

                 Trigger -> (structure)
                     The  CloudWatch alarm definition that determines when au-
                     tomatic scaling activity is triggered.

                     CloudWatchAlarmDefinition -> (structure)
                        The definition of a CloudWatch metric alarm. When  the
                        defined  alarm  conditions  are  met  along with other
                        trigger parameters, scaling activity begins.

                        ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                            Determines how the metric specified by  MetricName
                            is compared to the value specified by Threshold .

                        EvaluationPeriods -> (integer)
                            The  number of periods, in five-minute increments,
                            during which the alarm condition must exist before
                            the alarm triggers automatic scaling activity. The
                            default value is 1 .

                        MetricName -> (string)
                            The name of the CloudWatch metric that is  watched
                            to determine an alarm condition.

                        Namespace -> (string)
                            The  namespace  for the CloudWatch metric. The de-
                            fault is AWS/ElasticMapReduce .

                        Period -> (integer)
                            The period, in seconds, over which  the  statistic
                            is  applied. CloudWatch metrics for Amazon EMR are
                            emitted every five minutes (300  seconds),  so  if
                            you specify a CloudWatch metric, specify 300 .

                        Statistic -> (string)
                            The  statistic  to  apply to the metric associated
                            with the alarm. The default is AVERAGE .

                        Threshold -> (double)
                            The value against which the specified statistic is
                            compared.

                        Unit -> (string)
                            The unit of measure associated with the CloudWatch
                            metric being watched. The value specified for Unit
                            must  correspond  to  the  units  specified in the
                            CloudWatch metric.

                        Dimensions -> (list)
                            A CloudWatch metric dimension.

                            (structure)
                               A CloudWatch dimension, which is specified  us-
                               ing  a  Key  (known  as  a Name in CloudWatch),
                               Value pair. By default, Amazon EMR uses one di-
                               mension  whose  Key is JobFlowID and Value is a
                               variable representing the cluster ID, which  is
                               ${emr.clusterId}  .  This  enables  the rule to
                               bootstrap when the cluster  ID  becomes  avail-
                               able.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The dimension name.

                               Value -> (string)
                                   The dimension value.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ClusterId -> (string)
          Specifies the ID of a cluster. The instance group to which the auto-
          matic scaling policy is applied is within this cluster.

          The automatic scaling policy definition.

          Status -> (structure)
              The status of an automatic scaling policy.

              State -> (string)
                 Indicates the status of the automatic scaling policy.

              StateChangeReason -> (structure)

                     tus.``USER_REQUEST`` indicates that  the  scaling  policy
                     status was changed by a user. PROVISION_FAILURE indicates
                     that the status change was because the policy  failed  to

                     A  friendly, more verbose message that accompanies an au-
                     tomatic scaling policy state change.

          Constraints -> (structure)
              The upper and lower Amazon EC2 instance limits for an  automatic
              scaling policy. Automatic scaling activity will not cause an in-

                 grow. Scale-out activities will not add instances beyond this
                 boundary.

          Rules -> (list)
              The scale-in and scale-out rules  that  comprise  the  automatic
              scaling policy.

              (structure)
                 A  scale-in  or scale-out rule that defines scaling activity,
                 including the CloudWatch metric alarm that triggers activity,
                 how  Amazon EC2 instances are added or removed, and the peri-
                 odicity of adjustments. The automatic scaling policy  for  an
                 instance  group  can  comprise  one or more automatic scaling
                 rules.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name used to identify an automatic scaling rule. Rule
                     names must be unique within a scaling policy.

                 Description -> (string)
                     A  friendly,  more  verbose  description of the automatic
                     scaling rule.

                 Action -> (structure)
                     The conditions that trigger an automatic  scaling  activ-
                     ity.

                     Market -> (string)
                        Not available for instance groups. Instance groups use
                        the market type specified for the group.

                     SimpleScalingPolicyConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The type of adjustment the automatic scaling  activity
                        makes  when  triggered, and the periodicity of the ad-
                        justment.

                        AdjustmentType -> (string)
                            The way in which Amazon EC2  instances  are  added
                            (if  ScalingAdjustment  is  a  positive number) or
                            terminated (if  ScalingAdjustment  is  a  negative
                            number)  each  time  the scaling activity is trig-
                            gered.   CHANGE_IN_CAPACITY   is   the    default.
                            CHANGE_IN_CAPACITY  indicates  that the Amazon EC2
                            instance count increments or decrements by Scalin-
                            gAdjustment  , which should be expressed as an in-
                            teger.  PERCENT_CHANGE_IN_CAPACITY  indicates  the
                            instance  count  increments  or  decrements by the
                            percentage specified by ScalingAdjustment ,  which
                            should be expressed as an integer. For example, 20
                            indicates an increase in 20% increments of cluster
                            capacity. EXACT_CAPACITY indicates the scaling ac-
                            tivity results in an instance group with the  num-
                            ber  of  Amazon EC2 instances specified by Scalin-
                            gAdjustment , which should be expressed as a posi-
                            tive integer.

                        ScalingAdjustment -> (integer)
                            The  amount  by  which  to  scale in or scale out,
                            based on the specified AdjustmentType . A positive
                            value  adds to the instance group's Amazon EC2 in-
                            stance count while a negative number  removes  in-
                            stances.  If AdjustmentType is set to EXACT_CAPAC-
                            ITY , the number should only be a  positive  inte-
                            ger.    If   AdjustmentType   is   set   to   PER-
                            CENT_CHANGE_IN_CAPACITY , the value should express
                            the percentage as an integer. For example, -20 in-
                            dicates a decrease in 20%  increments  of  cluster
                            capacity.

                        CoolDown -> (integer)
                            The  amount  of  time, in seconds, after a scaling
                            activity completes before any further  trigger-re-
                            lated  scaling  activities  can start. The default
                            value is 0.

                 Trigger -> (structure)
                     The CloudWatch alarm definition that determines when  au-
                     tomatic scaling activity is triggered.

                     CloudWatchAlarmDefinition -> (structure)
                        The  definition of a CloudWatch metric alarm. When the
                        defined alarm conditions  are  met  along  with  other
                        trigger parameters, scaling activity begins.

                        ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                            Determines  how the metric specified by MetricName
                            is compared to the value specified by Threshold .

                        EvaluationPeriods -> (integer)
                            The number of periods, in five-minute  increments,
                            during which the alarm condition must exist before
                            the alarm triggers automatic scaling activity. The
                            default value is 1 .

                        MetricName -> (string)
                            The  name of the CloudWatch metric that is watched
                            to determine an alarm condition.

                        Namespace -> (string)
                            The namespace for the CloudWatch metric.  The  de-
                            fault is AWS/ElasticMapReduce .

                        Period -> (integer)
                            The  period,  in seconds, over which the statistic
                            is applied. CloudWatch metrics for Amazon EMR  are
                            emitted  every  five  minutes (300 seconds), so if
                            you specify a CloudWatch metric, specify 300 .

                        Statistic -> (string)
                            The statistic to apply to  the  metric  associated
                            with the alarm. The default is AVERAGE .

                        Threshold -> (double)
                            The value against which the specified statistic is
                            compared.

                        Unit -> (string)
                            The unit of measure associated with the CloudWatch
                            metric being watched. The value specified for Unit
                            must correspond to  the  units  specified  in  the
                            CloudWatch metric.

                        Dimensions -> (list)
                            A CloudWatch metric dimension.

                            (structure)
                               A  CloudWatch dimension, which is specified us-
                               ing a Key (known  as  a  Name  in  CloudWatch),
                               Value pair. By default, Amazon EMR uses one di-
                               mension whose Key is JobFlowID and Value  is  a
                               variable  representing the cluster ID, which is
                               ${emr.clusterId} . This  enables  the  rule  to
                               bootstrap  when  the  cluster ID becomes avail-
                               able.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The dimension name.

                               Value -> (string)
                                   The dimension value.

       ClusterArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster.
