OPTIONS
       --release-label (string)
          Specifies  the Amazon EMR release version, which determines the ver-
          sions of application software that are installed on the cluster. For
          example,  --release-label  emr-5.15.0  installs the application ver-
          sions and features available in that version. For details about  ap-
          plication  versions  and features available in each release, see the
          Amazon EMR Release Guide:

          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide

          Use --release-label only for Amazon  EMR  release  version  4.0  and
          later.  Use  --ami-version  for earlier versions. You cannot specify
          both a release label and AMI version.

       --os-release-label (string)
          Specifies a particular Amazon Linux release for all nodes in a clus-
          ter launch request. If a release is not specified, EMR uses the lat-
          est validated Amazon Linux release for cluster launch.

       --ami-version (string)
          Applies only to Amazon EMR release versions earlier  than  4.0.  Use
          --release-label  for  4.0 and later. Specifies the version of Amazon
          Linux Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to use when  launching  Amazon  EC2
          instances in the cluster. For example, --ami-version 3.1.0 .

       --instance-groups (list)
          Specifies  the number and type of Amazon EC2 instances to create for
          each node type in a cluster, using uniform instance groups. You  can
          specify  either --instance-groups or --instance-fleets but not both.
          For more information, see the following topic in the EMR  Management
          Guide:

          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-instance-group-configuration.html

          You can specify arguments individually using multiple InstanceGroup-
          Type  argument  blocks, one for the MASTER instance group, one for a
          CORE instance group, and optional, multiple TASK instance groups.

          If you specify inline JSON structures, enclose the entire  Instance-
          GroupType argument block in single quotation marks.

          Each  InstanceGroupType  block takes the following inline arguments.
          Optional arguments are shown in [square brackets].

          o [Name] - An optional friendly name for the instance group.

          o InstanceGroupType - MASTER , CORE , or TASK .

          o InstanceType - The type of EC2 instance, for example m4.large , to
            use for all nodes in the instance group.

          o InstanceCount  -  The  number of EC2 instances to provision in the
            instance group.

          o [BidPrice] - If specified, indicates that the instance group  uses
            Spot  Instances.  This is the maximum price you are willing to pay
            for Spot Instances. Specify OnDemandPrice to set the amount  equal
            to the On-Demand price, or specify an amount in USD.

          o [EbsConfiguration]  - Specifies additional Amazon EBS storage vol-
            umes attached to EC2 instances using an inline JSON structure.

          o [AutoScalingPolicy] - Specifies an automatic  scaling  policy  for
            the instance group using an inline JSON structure.

       --instance-type (string)
          Shortcut  parameter  as an alternative to --instance-groups . Speci-
          fies the type of Amazon EC2 instance to use in a  cluster.  If  used
          without  the  --instance-count  parameter, the cluster consists of a
          single master node running on the EC2 instance type specified.  When
          used  together  with --instance-count , one instance is used for the
          master node, and the remainder are used for the core node type.

       --instance-count (string)
          Shortcut parameter as an alternative to --instance-groups when  used
          together  with  --instance-type . Specifies the number of Amazon EC2
          instances to create for a cluster. One instance is used for the mas-
          ter node, and the remainder are used for the core node type.

       --auto-terminate | --no-auto-terminate (boolean)
          Specifies  whether the cluster should terminate after completing all
          the steps. Auto termination is off by default.

       --instance-fleets (list)
          Applies only to Amazon EMR release version 5.0 and later.  Specifies
          the  number and type of Amazon EC2 instances to create for each node
          type in a cluster, using instance fleets.  You  can  specify  either
          --instance-fleets or --instance-groups but not both. For more infor-
          mation and examples, see the following topic in the Amazon EMR  Man-
          agement Guide:

          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-instance-fleet.html

          You can specify arguments individually using multiple InstanceFleet-
          Type  argument  blocks, one for the MASTER instance fleet, one for a
          CORE instance fleet, and an optional TASK instance fleet.

          The following arguments can be specified for  each  instance  fleet.
          Optional arguments are shown in [square brackets].

          o [Name] - An optional friendly name for the instance fleet.

          o InstanceFleetType - MASTER , CORE , or TASK .

          o TargetOnDemandCapacity  -  The  target capacity of On-Demand units
            for the instance fleet, which determines how  many  On-Demand  In-
            stances  to  provision.  The WeightedCapacity specified for an in-
            stance type within InstanceTypeConfigs counts  toward  this  total
            when  an  instance  type  with  the  On-Demand  purchasing  option
            launches.

          o TargetSpotCapacity - The target capacity of Spot units for the in-
            stance  fleet,  which determines how many Spot Instances to provi-
            sion. The WeightedCapacity specified for an instance  type  within
            InstanceTypeConfigs counts toward this total when an instance type
            with the Spot purchasing option launches.

          o [LaunchSpecifications] -  When  TargetSpotCapacity  is  specified,
            specifies  the  block  duration  and  timeout  action for Spot In-
            stances.

          o InstanceTypeConfigs - Specify up to five EC2 instance types to use
            in  the  instance  fleet, including details such as Spot price and
            Amazon EBS configuration. When you use an On-Demand  or  Spot  In-
            stance  allocation  strategy,  you  can  specify up to 30 instance
            types per instance fleet.

          profile, use the --use-default-roles parameter. If the role and  in-
          stance  profile  do  not  already  exist, use the aws emr create-de-
          fault-roles command to create them.

       --auto-scaling-role (string)
          Specify --auto-scaling-role EMR_AutoScaling_DefaultRole if an  auto-
          matic  scaling  policy  is specified for an instance group using the
          --instance-groups parameter. This default IAM role allows the  auto-
          matic  scaling  feature to launch and terminate Amazon EC2 instances
          during scaling operations.

       --use-default-roles (boolean)
          Specifies that the cluster  should  use  the  default  service  role
          (EMR_DefaultRole)  and  instance  profile  (EMR_EC2_DefaultRole) for
          permissions to access other AWS services.

          Make sure that the role and instance profile exist first. To  create
          them, use the create-default-roles command.

       --configurations (string)
          Specifies  a  JSON file that contains configuration classifications,
          which you can use to customize applications that Amazon EMR installs
          when  cluster  instances  launch. Applies only to Amazon EMR 4.0 and
          later. The file referenced can either be stored locally  (for  exam-
          ple, --configurations file://configurations.json ) or stored in Ama-
          zon S3 (for example,  --configurations  https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-
          Bucket/configurations.json  ).  Each  classification  usually corre-
          sponds to the xml configuration file for  an  application,  such  as
          yarn-site  for YARN. For a list of available configuration classifi-
          cations and example JSON, see the following topic in the Amazon  EMR
          Release Guide:

          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/emr-configure-apps.html

       --ec2-attributes (structure)
          Configures cluster and Amazon EC2 instance  configurations.  Accepts
          the following arguments:

          o KeyName  - Specifies the name of the AWS EC2 key pair that will be
            used for SSH connections to the master node and other instances on
            the cluster.

          o AvailabilityZone  -  Applies  to clusters that use the uniform in-
            stance group configuration. Specifies  the  availability  zone  in
            which to launch the cluster. For example, us-west-1b . Availabili-
            tyZone is used for uniform instance  groups,  while  Availability-
            Zones (plural) is used for instance fleets.

          o AvailabilityZones  -  Applies  to  clusters  that use the instance
            fleet configuration. When multiple Availability Zones  are  speci-
            fied,  Amazon EMR evaluates them and launches instances in the op-
            timal Availability Zone. AvailabilityZone is used for uniform  in-
            stance  groups,  while  AvailabilityZones (plural) is used for in-
            stance fleets.

          o SubnetId - Applies to clusters that use the uniform instance group
            configuration. Specify the VPC subnet in which to create the clus-
            ter. SubnetId is used for uniform instance groups, while SubnetIds
            (plural) is used for instance fleets.

          o SubnetIds  -  Applies to clusters that use the instance fleet con-
            figuration. When multiple EC2 subnet IDs are specified, Amazon EMR
            evaluates  them and launches instances in the optimal subnet. Sub-
            netId is used for uniform instance groups, while  SubnetIds  (plu-
            ral) is used for instance fleets.

          o InstanceProfile  - An IAM role that allows EC2 instances to access
            other AWS services, such as Amazon S3, that are required for oper-
            ations.

          o EmrManagedMasterSecurityGroup  - The security group ID of the Ama-
            zon EC2 security group for the master node.

          o EmrManagedSlaveSecurityGroup - The security group ID of the Amazon
            EC2 security group for the slave nodes.

          o ServiceAccessSecurityGroup  -  The security group ID of the Amazon
            EC2 security group for Amazon EMR access to clusters in  VPC  pri-
            vate subnets.

          o AdditionalMasterSecurityGroups  -  A list of additional Amazon EC2
            security group IDs for the master node.

          o AdditionalSlaveSecurityGroups - A list of  additional  Amazon  EC2
            security group IDs for the slave nodes.

          }

       --termination-protected | --no-termination-protected (boolean)
          Specifies whether to lock the cluster to prevent the Amazon EC2  in-
          stances  from being terminated by API call, user intervention, or an
          error.

       --scale-down-behavior (string)
          Specifies the way that individual  Amazon  EC2  instances  terminate
          when  an  automatic scale-in activity occurs or an instance group is
          resized.

          Accepted values:

          o TERMINATE_AT_TASK_COMPLETION - Specifies that  Amazon  EMR  black-
            lists and drains tasks from nodes before terminating the instance.

          o TERMINATE_AT_INSTANCE_HOUR  -  Specifies that Amazon EMR terminate
            EC2 instances at the instance-hour boundary,  regardless  of  when
            the request to terminate was submitted.

       --visible-to-all-users | --no-visible-to-all-users (boolean)
          Specifies whether the cluster is visible to all IAM users of the AWS
          account associated with the cluster. If a user has the proper policy
          permissions set, they can also manage the cluster.

          Visibility is on by default. The --no-visible-to-all-users option is
          no longer supported. To restrict cluster visibility, use an IAM pol-
          icy.

       --enable-debugging | --no-enable-debugging (boolean)
          Specifies  that the debugging tool is enabled for the cluster, which
          allows you to browse log files using the Amazon EMR console. Turning
          debugging  on  requires that you specify --log-uri because log files
          must be stored in Amazon S3 so that Amazon EMR can  index  them  for
          viewing  in the console. Effective January 23, 2023, Amazon EMR will
          discontinue the debugging tool for all versions.

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags to associate with a cluster, which apply to each Ama-
          zon  EC2 instance in the cluster. Tags are key-value pairs that con-
          sist of a required key string with a maximum of 128 characters,  and
          an optional value string with a maximum of 256 characters.

          You  can specify tags in key=value format or you can add a tag with-
          out a value using only the key name, for example key . Use  a  space
          to separate multiple tags.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --bootstrap-actions (list)
          Specifies  a  list  of bootstrap actions to run on each EC2 instance
          when a cluster is created. Bootstrap actions run  on  each  instance
          immediately  after Amazon EMR provisions the EC2 instance and before
          Amazon EMR installs specified applications.

          You can specify a bootstrap action as an inline JSON  structure  en-
          closed in single quotation marks, or you can use a shorthand syntax,
          specifying multiple bootstrap actions, each separated  by  a  space.
          When  using  the  shorthand  syntax, each bootstrap action takes the
          following parameters, separated by commas with  no  trailing  space.
          Optional parameters are shown in [square brackets].

          o Path  - The path and file name of the script to run, which must be
            accessible  to  each  instance  in  the  cluster.   For   example,
            Path=s3://mybucket/myscript.sh .

          o [Name]  -  A  friendly name to help you identify the bootstrap ac-
            tion. For example, Name=BootstrapAction1

          o [Args] - A comma-separated list of arguments to pass to the  boot-
            strap  action  script.  Arguments  can  be either a list of values
            (Args=arg1,arg2,arg3 ) or a list of key-value pairs,  as  well  as
            optional      values,      enclosed     in     square     brackets
            (Args=[arg1,arg2=arg2value,arg3]) .

       --emrfs (structure)
          Specifies EMRFS configuration options, such as consistent  view  and
          Amazon S3 encryption parameters.

          When you use Amazon EMR release version 4.8.0 or later, we recommend
          that you use the  --configurations  option  together  with  the  em-
          rfs-site  configuration  classification  to configure EMRFS, and use
          security configurations to configure encryption for  EMRFS  data  in
          Amazon  S3 instead. For more information, see the following topic in
          the Amazon EMR Management Guide:

          Specifies  the name of a security configuration to use for the clus-
          ter. A security configuration defines data encryption  settings  and
          other  security  options.  For  more  information, see the following
          topic in the Amazon EMR Management Guide:

          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/emr-encryption-enable-security-configuration.html

          Use list-security-configurations to get a list of available security
          configurations in the active account.

       --custom-ami-id (string)
          Applies only to Amazon EMR release version 5.7.0 and  later.  Speci-
          fies  the  AMI  ID of a custom AMI to use when Amazon EMR provisions
          EC2 instances. A custom AMI can be used to encrypt  the  Amazon  EBS
          root  volume.  It  can  also be used instead of bootstrap actions to
          customize cluster node configurations. For more information, see the
          following topic in the Amazon EMR Management Guide:

          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-custom-ami.html

       --ebs-root-volume-size (string)
          This option is available only with Amazon EMR version 4.x and later.
          Specifies  the  size,  in  GiB, of the EBS root device volume of the
          Amazon Linux AMI that is used for each EC2 instance in the cluster.

       --ebs-root-volume-iops (string)
          This option is available only with Amazon  EMR  version  6.15.0  and
          later. Specifies the IOPS, of the EBS root device volume of the Ama-
          zon Linux AMI that is used for each EC2 instance in the cluster.

       --ebs-root-volume-throughput (string)
          This option is available only with Amazon  EMR  version  6.15.0  and
          later.  Specifies  the  throughput, in MiB/s, of the EBS root device
          volume of the Amazon Linux AMI that is used for each EC2 instance in
          the cluster.

       --repo-upgrade-on-boot (string)
          Applies  only when a --custom-ami-id is specified. On first boot, by
          default, Amazon Linux AMIs connect to package  repositories  to  in-
          stall security updates before other services start. You can set this
          parameter using --rep-upgrade-on-boot NONE to disable these updates.
          CAUTION: This creates additional security risks.

       --kerberos-attributes (structure)
          Specifies required cluster attributes for Kerberos when Kerberos au-
          thentication is enabled in the specified --security-configuration  .
          Takes the following arguments:

          o Realm  -  Specifies  the  name  of the Kerberos realm to which all
            nodes in a cluster belong. For example, Realm=EC2.INTERNAL .

            cross-realm  trust  with  a  KDC in a different realm. This is the
            cross-realm principal password, which  must  be  identical  across
            realms.

          o ADDomainJoinUser - Required when establishing trust with an Active
            Directory domain. This is the User logon name  of  an  AD  account
            with sufficient privileges to join resources to the domain.

          o ADDomainJoinPassword - The AD password for ADDomainJoinUser .

                 cores  or  instances for instance groups and measured through
                 units for instance fleets. Managed scaling activities are not
                 allowed beyond this boundary.

              MaximumOnDemandCapacityUnits -> (integer)
                 The  upper  boundary  of  on-demand EC2 units. It is measured
                 through VCPU cores or instances for instance groups and  mea-
                 sured  through units for instance fleets. The on-demand units
                 are not allowed to scale beyond  this  boundary.  This  value
                 must be lower than MaximumCapacityUnits.

              UnitType -> (string)
                 The unit type used for specifying a managed scaling policy.

              MaximumCoreCapacityUnits -> (integer)
                 The upper boundary of EC2 units for core node type in a clus-
                 ter. It is measured through VCPU cores or instances  for  in-
                 stance groups and measured through units for instance fleets.
                 The core units are not allowed to scale beyond this boundary.
                 The  parameter  is  used to split capacity allocation between
                 core and task nodes.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ComputeLimits={MinimumCapacityUnits=integer,MaximumCapacityUnits=integer,MaximumOnDemandCapacityUnits=integer,UnitType=string,MaximumCoreCapacityUnits=integer}

EXAMPLES
       Most  of  the  following examples assume that you specified your Amazon
       EMR service role and Amazon EC2 instance profile. If you have not  done
       this,  you  must  specify  each  required IAM role or use the --use-de-
       fault-roles parameter when creating your cluster. For more  information
       about specifying IAM roles, see Configure IAM Roles for Amazon EMR Per-
       missions to AWS Services in the Amazon EMR Management Guide.

       Example 1: To create a cluster

       The following create-cluster example creates a simple EMR cluster.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --release-label emr-5.14.0 \
              --instance-type m4.large \
              --instance-count 2

       This command produces no output.

       Example 2: To create an Amazon EMR cluster with default ServiceRole and
       InstanceProfile roles

       The following create-cluster example creates an Amazon EMR cluster that
       uses the --instance-groups configuration.

       Example 3: To create an Amazon EMR cluster that uses an instance fleet

       The following create-cluster example creates an Amazon EMR cluster that
       uses the --instance-fleets configuration, specifying two instance types
       for each fleet and two EC2 Subnets.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --release-label emr-5.14.0 \
              --service-role EMR_DefaultRole \
              --ec2-attributes InstanceProfile=EMR_EC2_DefaultRole,SubnetIds=['subnet-ab12345c','subnet-de67890f'] \
              --instance-fleets InstanceFleetType=MASTER,TargetOnDemandCapacity=1,InstanceTypeConfigs=['{InstanceType=m4.large}'] InstanceFleetType=CORE,TargetSpotCapacity=11,InstanceTypeConfigs=['{InstanceType=m4.large,BidPrice=0.5,WeightedCapacity=3}','{InstanceType=m4.2xlarge,BidPrice=0.9,WeightedCapacity=5}'],LaunchSpecifications={SpotSpecification='{TimeoutDurationMinutes=120,TimeoutAction=SWITCH_TO_ON_DEMAND}'}

       Example 4: To create a cluster with default roles

       The following create-cluster example uses the  --use-default-roles  pa-
       rameter to specify the default service role and instance profile.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --release-label emr-5.9.0 \
              --use-default-roles \

       the type and number of EC2 instances to use for master, core, and  task
       instance groups.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --release-label emr-5.9.0 \
              --instance-groups Name=Master,InstanceGroupType=MASTER,InstanceType=m4.large,InstanceCount=1 Name=Core,InstanceGroupType=CORE,InstanceType=m4.large,InstanceCount=2 Name=Task,InstanceGroupType=TASK,InstanceType=m4.large,InstanceCount=2

       Example 10: To specify that a cluster should terminate after completing
       all steps

       The following create-cluster example uses --auto-terminate  to  specify
       that  the  cluster  should shut down automatically after completing all
       steps.

       Example 11: To specify cluster configuration details such as the Amazon
       EC2 key pair, network configuration, and security groups

       The  following create-cluster example creates a cluster with the Amazon
       EC2 key pair named myKey and a customized instance profile named myPro-
       file. Key pairs are used to authorize SSH connections to cluster nodes,
       most often the master node. For more information, see Use an Amazon EC2
       Key Pair for SSH Credentials in the Amazon EMR Management Guide.

          aws emr create-cluster \

       The  following example creates a cluster in the us-east-1b availability
       zone.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --ec2-attributes AvailabilityZone=us-east-1b \
              --release-label emr-5.9.0 \
              --instance-groups InstanceGroupType=MASTER,InstanceCount=1,InstanceType=m4.large InstanceGroupType=CORE,InstanceCount=2,InstanceType=m4.large

       The following example creates a cluster and specifies only  the  Amazon
       EMR-managed security groups.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --release-label emr-5.9.0 \
              --service-role myServiceRole \
              --ec2-attributes InstanceProfile=myRole,EmrManagedMasterSecurityGroup=sg-master1,EmrManagedSlaveSecurityGroup=sg-slave1 \
              --instance-groups InstanceGroupType=MASTER,InstanceCount=1,InstanceType=m4.large InstanceGroupType=CORE,InstanceCount=2,InstanceType=m4.large

       The  following  example creates a cluster and specifies only additional
       Amazon EC2 security groups.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --release-label emr-5.9.0 \
              --service-role myServiceRole \
              --ec2-attributes InstanceProfile=myRole,AdditionalMasterSecurityGroups=[sg-addMaster1,sg-addMaster2,sg-addMaster3,sg-addMaster4],AdditionalSlaveSecurityGroups=[sg-addSlave1,sg-addSlave2,sg-addSlave3,sg-addSlave4] \
              --instance-groups InstanceGroupType=MASTER,InstanceCount=1,InstanceType=m4.large InstanceGroupType=CORE,InstanceCount=2,InstanceType=m4.large

       The following example creates a cluster and specifies  the  EMR-Managed
       security groups, as well as additional security groups.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --release-label emr-5.9.0 \
              --service-role myServiceRole \
              --ec2-attributes InstanceProfile=myRole,EmrManagedMasterSecurityGroup=sg-master1,EmrManagedSlaveSecurityGroup=sg-slave1,AdditionalMasterSecurityGroups=[sg-addMaster1,sg-addMaster2,sg-addMaster3,sg-addMaster4],AdditionalSlaveSecurityGroups=[sg-addSlave1,sg-addSlave2,sg-addSlave3,sg-addSlave4] \
              --instance-groups InstanceGroupType=MASTER,InstanceCount=1,InstanceType=m4.large InstanceGroupType=CORE,InstanceCount=2,InstanceType=m4.large

       The following example creates a cluster in a VPC private subnet and use
       a specific Amazon EC2 security group to enable Amazon EMR  service  ac-
       cess, which is required for clusters in private subnets.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --release-label emr-5.9.0 \
              --service-role myServiceRole \

              --instance-groups InstanceGroupType=MASTER,InstanceCount=1,InstanceType=m4.large InstanceGroupType=CORE,InstanceCount=2,InstanceType=m4.large

       The following example specifies security group configuration parameters
       using a JSON file named ec2_attributes.json  that  is  stored  locally.
       NOTE: JSON arguments must include options and values as their own items
       in the list.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --release-label emr-5.9.0 \
              --service-role myServiceRole \

              --instance-groups InstanceGroupType=MASTER,InstanceCount=1,InstanceType=m4.large InstanceGroupType=CORE,InstanceCount=2,InstanceType=m4.large

       Contents of ec2_attributes.json:

          [
              {
                  "SubnetId": "subnet-xxxxx",
                  "KeyName": "myKey",
                  "InstanceProfile":"myRole",
                  "EmrManagedMasterSecurityGroup": "sg-master1",

              }
          ]

       Example 12: To enable debugging and specify a log URI

       The following create-cluster example uses the --enable-debugging param-
       eter,  which  allows you to view log files more easily using the debug-
       ging tool in the Amazon EMR console. The  --log-uri  parameter  is  re-
       quired with --enable-debugging.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --enable-debugging \
              --log-uri s3://myBucket/myLog \
              --release-label emr-5.9.0 \
              --instance-groups InstanceGroupType=MASTER,InstanceCount=1,InstanceType=m4.large InstanceGroupType=CORE,InstanceCount=2,InstanceType=m4.large \
              --auto-terminate

       Example 13: To add tags when creating a cluster

       Tags  are  key-value  pairs that help you identify and manage clusters.
       The following create-cluster example uses the --tags parameter to  cre-
       ate  three tags for a cluster, one with the key name name and the value
       Shirley Rodriguez, a second with the key name age and the value 29, and
       a third tag with the key name department and the value Analytics.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --tags name="Shirley Rodriguez" age=29 department="Analytics" \
              --release-label emr-5.32.0 \
              --instance-type m5.xlarge \
              --instance-count 3 \
              --use-default-roles

       The following example lists the tags applied to a cluster.

          aws emr describe-cluster \
              --cluster-id j-XXXXXXYY \
              --query Cluster.Tags

       Example 14: To use a security configuration that enables encryption and
       other security features

       The following create-cluster example uses the  --security-configuration
       parameter  to  specify a security configuration for an EMR cluster. You
       can use security configurations with Amazon EMR version 4.8.0 or later.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --instance-type m4.large \
              --release-label emr-5.9.0 \
              --security-configuration mySecurityConfiguration

       Example 15: To create a cluster with  additional  EBS  storage  volumes
       configured for the instance groups

       When specifying additional EBS volumes, the following arguments are re-
       quired: VolumeType, SizeInGB if EbsBlockDeviceConfigs is specified.

       The following create-cluster example creates a  cluster  with  multiple
       EBS volumes attached to EC2 instances in the core instance group.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --release-label emr-5.9.0  \
              --use-default-roles \
              --instance-groups InstanceGroupType=MASTER,InstanceCount=1,InstanceType=d2.xlarge 'InstanceGroupType=CORE,InstanceCount=2,InstanceType=d2.xlarge,EbsConfiguration={EbsOptimized=true,EbsBlockDeviceConfigs=[{VolumeSpecification={VolumeType=gp2,SizeInGB=100}},{VolumeSpecification={VolumeType=io1,SizeInGB=100,Iops=100},VolumesPerInstance=4}]}' \
              --auto-terminate

       The  following  example creates a cluster with multiple EBS volumes at-
       tached to EC2 instances in the master instance group.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --release-label emr-5.9.0 \
              --use-default-roles \
              --instance-groups 'InstanceGroupType=MASTER, InstanceCount=1, InstanceType=d2.xlarge, EbsConfiguration={EbsOptimized=true, EbsBlockDeviceConfigs=[{VolumeSpecification={VolumeType=io1, SizeInGB=100, Iops=100}},{VolumeSpecification={VolumeType=standard,SizeInGB=50},VolumesPerInstance=3}]}' InstanceGroupType=CORE,InstanceCount=2,InstanceType=d2.xlarge \
              --auto-terminate

       Example 16: To create a cluster with an automatic scaling policy

       You can attach automatic scaling policies to  core  and  task  instance
       groups  using  Amazon  EMR version 4.0 and later. The automatic scaling
       policy dynamically adds and removes EC2 instances  in  response  to  an
       Amazon  CloudWatch  metric.  For  more information, see Using Automatic
       Scaling            in             Amazon             EMR             <-
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-auto-
       matic-scaling.html>`_ in the Amazon EMR Management Guide.

       When attaching an automatic scaling policy, you must also  specify  the
       default  role  for  automatic scaling using --auto-scaling-role EMR_Au-
       toScaling_DefaultRole.

       The following create-cluster example specifies  the  automatic  scaling
       policy for the CORE instance group using the AutoScalingPolicy argument
       with an embedded JSON structure, which  specifies  the  scaling  policy
       configuration.  Instance  groups  with  an embedded JSON structure must
       have the entire collection of arguments enclosed in single quotes.  Us-
       ing  single  quotes is optional for instance groups without an embedded
       JSON structure.

          aws emr create-cluster
              --release-label emr-5.9.0 \
              --use-default-roles --auto-scaling-role EMR_AutoScaling_DefaultRole \
              --instance-groups InstanceGroupType=MASTER,InstanceType=d2.xlarge,InstanceCount=1 'InstanceGroupType=CORE,InstanceType=d2.xlarge,InstanceCount=2,AutoScalingPolicy={Constraints={MinCapacity=1,MaxCapacity=5},Rules=[{Name=TestRule,Description=TestDescription,Action={Market=ON_DEMAND,SimpleScalingPolicyConfiguration={AdjustmentType=EXACT_CAPACITY,ScalingAdjustment=2}},Trigger={CloudWatchAlarmDefinition={ComparisonOperator=GREATER_THAN,EvaluationPeriods=5,MetricName=TestMetric,Namespace=EMR,Period=3,Statistic=MAXIMUM,Threshold=4.5,Unit=NONE,Dimensions=[{Key=TestKey,Value=TestValue}]}}}]}'

       The following example uses a JSON  file,  instancegroupconfig.json,  to
       specify the configuration of all instance groups in a cluster. The JSON
       file specifies the automatic scaling policy configuration for the  core
       instance group.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --release-label emr-5.9.0 \
              --service-role EMR_DefaultRole \
              --ec2-attributes InstanceProfile=EMR_EC2_DefaultRole \
              --instance-groups file://myfolder/instancegroupconfig.json \
              --auto-scaling-role EMR_AutoScaling_DefaultRole

       Example 17: Add custom JAR steps when creating a cluster

       The  following  create-cluster  example  adds steps by specifying a JAR
       file stored in Amazon S3. Steps submit work  to  a  cluster.  The  main
       function  defined in the JAR file executes after EC2 instances are pro-
       visioned, any bootstrap actions have executed, and applications are in-
       stalled. The steps are specified using Type=CUSTOM_JAR.

       Custom  JAR  steps require the Jar= parameter, which specifies the path
       and file name of the JAR. Optional parameters are Type, Name, ActionOn-
       Failure,  Args,  and MainClass. If main class is not specified, the JAR
       file should specify Main-Class in its manifest file.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --steps Type=CUSTOM_JAR,Name=CustomJAR,ActionOnFailure=CONTINUE,Jar=s3://myBucket/mytest.jar,Args=arg1,arg2,arg3 Type=CUSTOM_JAR,Name=CustomJAR,ActionOnFailure=CONTINUE,Jar=s3://myBucket/mytest.jar,MainClass=mymainclass,Args=arg1,arg2,arg3  \

              --instance-groups InstanceGroupType=MASTER,InstanceCount=1,InstanceType=m4.large InstanceGroupType=CORE,InstanceCount=2,InstanceType=m4.large \
              --auto-terminate

       Example 18: To add streaming steps when creating a cluster

       The following create-cluster examples add a streaming step to a cluster
       that terminates after all steps run. Streaming steps require parameters
       Type and Args. Streaming steps optional parameters  are  Name  and  Ac-
       tionOnFailure.

       The following example specifies the step inline.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --steps Type=STREAMING,Name='Streaming Program',ActionOnFailure=CONTINUE,Args=[-files,s3://elasticmapreduce/samples/wordcount/wordSplitter.py,-mapper,wordSplitter.py,-reducer,aggregate,-input,s3://elasticmapreduce/samples/wordcount/input,-output,s3://mybucket/wordcount/output] \

              --auto-terminate

       The  following  example  uses  a locally stored JSON configuration file
       named multiplefiles.json. The  JSON  configuration  specifies  multiple
       files.  To  specify  multiple  files within a step, you must use a JSON
       configuration file to specify the step. JSON arguments must include op-
       tions and values as their own items in the list.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --steps file://./multiplefiles.json \

              --instance-groups InstanceGroupType=MASTER,InstanceCount=1,InstanceType=m4.large InstanceGroupType=CORE,InstanceCount=2,InstanceType=m4.large

       Example 21: To add bootstrap actions

       The following create-cluster example runs two bootstrap actions defined
       as scripts that are stored in Amazon S3.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --bootstrap-actions Path=s3://mybucket/myscript1,Name=BootstrapAction1,Args=[arg1,arg2] Path=s3://mybucket/myscript2,Name=BootstrapAction2,Args=[arg1,arg2] \
              --release-label emr-5.3.1 \
              --instance-groups InstanceGroupType=MASTER,InstanceCount=1,InstanceType=m4.large InstanceGroupType=CORE,InstanceCount=2,InstanceType=m4.large \
              --auto-terminate

       Example  22:  To  enable  EMRFS  consistent  view  and  customize   the
       RetryCount and RetryPeriod settings

       The  following  create-cluster  example  specifies  the retry count and
       retry period for EMRFS consistent view. The Consistent=true argument is
       required.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --instance-type m4.large \
              --release-label emr-5.9.0 \
              --emrfs Consistent=true,RetryCount=6,RetryPeriod=30

       The  following  example  specifies  the same EMRFS configuration as the
       previous example, using a locally stored JSON configuration file  named
       emrfsconfig.json.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --instance-type m4.large \
              --release-label emr-5.9.0 \
              --emrfs file://emrfsconfig.json

       Contents of emrfsconfig.json:

          {
              "Consistent": true,
              "RetryCount": 6,
              "RetryPeriod": 30
          }

       Example 23: To create a cluster with Kerberos configured

       The following create-cluster examples create a cluster using a security
       configuration with Kerberos enabled, and establishes  Kerberos  parame-
       ters for the cluster using --kerberos-attributes.

       The following command specifies Kerberos attributes for the cluster in-
       line.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --instance-type m3.xlarge \
              --release-label emr-5.10.0 \
              --service-role EMR_DefaultRole \
              --ec2-attributes InstanceProfile=EMR_EC2_DefaultRole \
              --security-configuration mySecurityConfiguration \
              --kerberos-attributes Realm=EC2.INTERNAL,KdcAdminPassword=123,CrossRealmTrustPrincipalPassword=123

       The following command specifies the same attributes, but  references  a
       locally  stored JSON file named kerberos_attributes.json. In this exam-
       ple, the file is saved in the same directory where you run the command.
       You can also reference a configuration file saved in Amazon S3.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --instance-type m3.xlarge \
              --release-label emr-5.10.0 \
              --service-role EMR_DefaultRole \
              --ec2-attributes InstanceProfile=EMR_EC2_DefaultRole \
              --security-configuration mySecurityConfiguration \
              --kerberos-attributes file://kerberos_attributes.json

       Contents of kerberos_attributes.json:

          {
              "Realm": "EC2.INTERNAL",
              "KdcAdminPassword": "123",
              "CrossRealmTrustPrincipalPassword": "123",
          }

       The following create-cluster example creates an Amazon EMR cluster that
       uses the --instance-groups configuration and has a managed scaling pol-
       icy.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --release-label emr-5.30.0 \
              --service-role EMR_DefaultRole \
              --ec2-attributes InstanceProfile=EMR_EC2_DefaultRole \
              --instance-groups InstanceGroupType=MASTER,InstanceCount=1,InstanceType=m4.large InstanceGroupType=CORE,InstanceCount=2,InstanceType=m4.large
              --managed-scaling-policy ComputeLimits='{MinimumCapacityUnits=2,MaximumCapacityUnits=4,UnitType=Instances}'

       The following create-cluster example creates an Amazon EMR cluster that
       uses the "--log-encryption-kms-key-id" to define KMS  key  ID  utilized
       for Log encryption.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --release-label emr-5.30.0 \
              --log-uri s3://myBucket/myLog \
              --log-encryption-kms-key-id arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:110302272565:key/dd559181-283e-45d7-99d1-66da348c4d33 \
              --instance-groups InstanceGroupType=MASTER,InstanceCount=1,InstanceType=m4.large InstanceGroupType=CORE,InstanceCount=2,InstanceType=m4.large

       The following create-cluster example creates an Amazon EMR cluster that
       uses the  "--placement-group-configs"  configuration  to  place  master
       nodes in a high-availability (HA) cluster within an EC2 placement group
       using SPREAD placement strategy.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --release-label emr-5.30.0 \
              --service-role EMR_DefaultRole \
              --ec2-attributes InstanceProfile=EMR_EC2_DefaultRole \
              --instance-groups InstanceGroupType=MASTER,InstanceCount=3,InstanceType=m4.largeInstanceGroupType=CORE,InstanceCount=1,InstanceType=m4.large \
              --placement-group-configs InstanceRole=MASTER

       The following create-cluster example creates an Amazon EMR cluster that
       uses  the  "--auto-termination-policy"  configuration to place an auto-
       matic idle termination threshold for the cluster.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --release-label emr-5.34.0 \
              --service-role EMR_DefaultRole \
              --ec2-attributes InstanceProfile=EMR_EC2_DefaultRole \
              --instance-groups InstanceGroupType=MASTER,InstanceCount=1,InstanceType=m4.large InstanceGroupType=CORE,InstanceCount=1,InstanceType=m4.large \
              --auto-termination-policy IdleTimeout=100

       The following create-cluster example creates an Amazon EMR cluster that
       uses  the  "--os-release-label"  to  define an Amazon Linux release for
       cluster launch

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --release-label emr-6.6.0 \
              --os-release-label 2.0.20220406.1 \
              --service-role EMR_DefaultRole \
              --ec2-attributes InstanceProfile=EMR_EC2_DefaultRole \
              --instance-groups InstanceGroupType=MASTER,InstanceCount=1,InstanceType=m4.large InstanceGroupType=CORE,InstanceCount=1,InstanceType=m4.large

       Example 24: To specify an EBS root volume attributes:  size,  iops  and
       throughput  for  cluster instances created with EMR releases 6.15.0 and
       later

       The following create-cluster example creates an Amazon EMR cluster that
       uses  root  volume  attributes to configure root volumes specifications
       for the EC2 instances.

          aws emr create-cluster \
              --name "Cluster with My Custom AMI" \
              --custom-ami-id ami-a518e6df \
