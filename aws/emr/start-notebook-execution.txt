OPTIONS
       --editor-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the EMR Notebook to use for notebook execu-
          tion.

       --relative-path (string)
          The path and file name of the notebook file for this execution, rel-
          ative  to  the  path specified for the EMR Notebook. For example, if
          you specify a path of s3://MyBucket/MyNotebooks when you  create  an
          EMR   Notebook   for   a   notebook   with   an   ID   of   e-ABCDE-
          FGHIJK1234567890ABCD (the EditorID of this request), and you specify
          a  RelativePath of my_notebook_executions/notebook_execution.ipynb ,
          the location of the file for  the  notebook  execution  is  s3://My-
          Bucket/MyNotebooks/e-ABCDEFGHIJK1234567890ABCD/my_notebook_execu-
          tions/notebook_execution.ipynb .

       --notebook-execution-name (string)
          An optional name for the notebook execution.

       --notebook-params (string)
          Input parameters in JSON format passed to the EMR Notebook  at  run-
          time for execution.

       --execution-engine (structure)
          Specifies the execution engine (cluster) that runs the notebook exe-
          cution.

          Id -> (string)
              The unique identifier of the execution engine. For an EMR  clus-
              ter, this is the cluster ID.

          Type -> (string)
              The  type  of  execution engine. A value of EMR specifies an EMR
              cluster.

          MasterInstanceSecurityGroupId -> (string)
              An optional unique ID of an EC2 security group to associate with
              the  master instance of the EMR cluster for this notebook execu-
              tion. For more information see Specifying  EC2  Security  Groups
              for EMR Notebooks in the EMR Management Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Id=string,Type=string,MasterInstanceSecurityGroupId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Id": "string",
            "Type": "EMR",
            "MasterInstanceSecurityGroupId": "string"
          }

       --service-role (string)
          The name or ARN of the IAM role that is used as the service role for
          Amazon EMR (the EMR role) for the notebook execution.

       --notebook-instance-security-group-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the Amazon EC2 security group to  associate
          with the EMR Notebook for this notebook execution.

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  tags  associated  with  a  notebook execution. Tags are
          user-defined key-value pairs that consist of a required  key  string
          with a maximum of 128 characters and an optional value string with a
          maximum of 256 characters.

          (structure)
              A key-value pair containing user-defined metadata that  you  can
              associate  with  an  Amazon EMR resource. Tags make it easier to
              associate clusters in various ways, such as grouping clusters to
              track your Amazon EMR resource allocation costs. For more infor-
              mation, see Tag Clusters .

              Key -> (string)
                 A user-defined key, which is the minimum required information
                 for a valid tag. For more information, see Tag .

              Value -> (string)
                 A  user-defined  value,  which is optional in a tag. For more
                 information, see Tag Clusters .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NotebookExecutionId -> (string)
          The unique identifier of the notebook execution.
