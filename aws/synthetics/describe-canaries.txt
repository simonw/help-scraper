DESCRIBE-CANARIES()                                        DESCRIBE-CANARIES()



NAME
       describe-canaries -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  returns  a list of the canaries in your account, along
       with full details about each canary.

       This operation supports resource-level authorization using an IAM  pol-
       icy  and  the  Names parameter. If you specify the Names parameter, the
       operation is successful only if you have authorization to view all  the
       canaries  that  you specify in your request. If you do not have permis-
       sion to view any of the canaries, the request  fails  with  a  403  re-
       sponse.

       You  are  required to use the Names parameter if you are logged on to a
       user or role that has an IAM policy that restricts which canaries  that
       you  are  allowed to view. For more information, see Limiting a user to
       viewing specific canaries .

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          A token that indicates that there is more data  available.  You  can
          use this token in a subsequent operation to retrieve the next set of
          results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specify this parameter to limit how many canaries are returned  each
          time you use the DescribeCanaries operation. If you omit this param-
          eter, the default of 20 is used.

       --names (list)
          Use this parameter to return only canaries that match the names that
          you specify here. You can specify as many as five canary names.

          If  you  specify this parameter, the operation is successful only if
          you have authorization to view all the canaries that you specify  in
          your  request.  If you do not have permission to view any of the ca-
          naries, the request fails with a 403 response.

          You are required to use this parameter if you are  logged  on  to  a
          user  or  role  that has an IAM policy that restricts which canaries
          that you are allowed to view. For more information, see  Limiting  a
          user to viewing specific canaries .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Canaries -> (list)
          Returns an array. Each item in the array contains the full  informa-
          tion about one canary.

          (structure)
              This structure contains all information about one canary in your
              account.

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique ID of this canary.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the canary.

              Code -> (structure)
                 This structure contains information about the canary's Lambda
                 handler  and  where its code is stored by CloudWatch Synthet-
                 ics.

                 SourceLocationArn -> (string)
                     The ARN of the Lambda layer where Synthetics  stores  the
                     canary script code.

                 Handler -> (string)
                     The  entry  point to use for the source code when running
                     the canary.

              ExecutionRoleArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the IAM role used to run  the  canary.  This  role
                 must include lambda.amazonaws.com as a principal in the trust
                 policy.

              Schedule -> (structure)
                 A structure that contains information about how often the ca-
                 nary is to run, and when these runs are to stop.

                 Expression -> (string)
                     A  rate  expression or a cron expression that defines how
                     often the canary is to run.

                     For a rate expression, The syntax is rate(*number unit* )
                     . unit can be minute , minutes , or hour .

                     For  example,  rate(1  minute)  runs  the  canary  once a
                     minute, rate(10 minutes) runs it once every  10  minutes,
                     and rate(1 hour) runs it once every hour. You can specify
                     a frequency between rate(1 minute) and rate(1 hour) .

                     Specifying rate(0 minute) or rate(0 hour)  is  a  special
                     value  that causes the canary to run only once when it is
                     started.

                     Use cron(*expression* ) to specify a cron expression. For
                     information  about  the  syntax for cron expressions, see
                     Scheduling canary runs using cron .

                 DurationInSeconds -> (long)
                     How long, in seconds, for the canary to  continue  making
                     regular runs after it was created. The runs are performed
                     according to the schedule in the Expression value.

              RunConfig -> (structure)
                 A structure that contains information about a canary run.

                 TimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                     How long the canary is allowed  to  run  before  it  must
                     stop.

                 MemoryInMB -> (integer)
                     The  maximum  amount  of  memory  available to the canary
                     while it is running, in MB. This value must be a multiple
                     of 64.

                 ActiveTracing -> (boolean)
                     Displays  whether this canary run used active X-Ray trac-
                     ing.

              SuccessRetentionPeriodInDays -> (integer)
                 The number of days to retain data about  successful  runs  of
                 this canary.

              FailureRetentionPeriodInDays -> (integer)
                 The  number  of days to retain data about failed runs of this
                 canary.

                     If  the  canary has insufficient permissions to run, this
                     field provides more details.

                 StateReasonCode -> (string)
                     If the canary cannot run or has failed, this  field  dis-
                     plays the reason.
