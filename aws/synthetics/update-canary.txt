OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the canary that you want to update. To find the names of
          your canaries, use DescribeCanaries .

          You  cannot  change  the name of a canary that has already been cre-
          ated.

       --code (structure)
          A structure that includes the entry  point  from  which  the  canary
          should  start  running your script. If the script is stored in an S3
          bucket, the bucket name, key, and version are also included.

          S3Bucket -> (string)
              If your canary script is located in S3, specify the bucket  name
              here. Do not include s3:// as the start of the bucket name.

          S3Key -> (string)
              The  S3  key  of  your script. For more information, see Working
              with Amazon S3 Objects .

          S3Version -> (string)
              The S3 version ID of your script.

          ZipFile -> (blob)
              If you input your canary script directly into the canary instead
              of  referring  to an S3 location, the value of this parameter is
              the base64-encoded contents of the .zip file that  contains  the
              script. It must be smaller than 225 Kb.

              For  large canary scripts, we recommend that you use an S3 loca-
              tion instead of inputting it directly with this parameter.

          Handler -> (string)
              The entry point to use for the source code when running the  ca-
              nary.  For canaries that use the syn-python-selenium-1.0 runtime
              or a syn-nodejs.puppeteer runtime earlier  than  syn-nodejs.pup-
              peteer-3.4  , the handler must be specified as `` fileName .han-
              dler`` . For syn-python-selenium-1.1 ,  syn-nodejs.puppeteer-3.4
              ,  and  later runtimes, the handler can be specified as `` file-
              Name .*functionName* `` , or you can specify a folder where  ca-
              nary scripts reside as `` folder /fileName .*functionName* `` .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Bucket=string,S3Key=string,S3Version=string,ZipFile=blob,Handler=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Bucket": "string",
            "S3Key": "string",
            "S3Version": "string",
            "ZipFile": blob,
            "Handler": "string"
          }

       --execution-role-arn (string)
          The ARN of the IAM role to be used to run the canary. This role must
          already exist, and must include lambda.amazonaws.com as a  principal
          in  the  trust policy. The role must also have the following permis-
          sions:

          o s3:PutObject

          o s3:GetBucketLocation

          o s3:ListAllMyBuckets

          o cloudwatch:PutMetricData

          o logs:CreateLogGroup

          o logs:CreateLogStream

          o logs:CreateLogStream

       --runtime-version (string)
          Specifies the runtime version to use for the canary. For a  list  of
          valid  runtime  versions and for more information about runtime ver-
          sions, see Canary Runtime Versions .

       --schedule (structure)
          A structure that contains information about how often the canary  is
          to run, and when these runs are to stop.

          Expression -> (string)
              A  rate  expression  or a cron expression that defines how often
              the canary is to run.

              For a rate expression, The syntax is rate(*number unit* ) . unit
              can be minute , minutes , or hour .

              For  example,  rate(1  minute)  runs  the  canary once a minute,
              rate(10 minutes) runs it once every 10 minutes, and rate(1 hour)
              runs  it  once  every  hour. You can specify a frequency between
              rate(1 minute) and rate(1 hour) .

              Specifying rate(0 minute) or rate(0 hour)  is  a  special  value
              that causes the canary to run only once when it is started.

              Use  cron(*expression* ) to specify a cron expression. You can't
              schedule a canary to wait for more than a year  before  running.
              For  information  about  the  syntax  for  cron expressions, see
              Scheduling canary runs using cron .

          DurationInSeconds -> (long)
              How long, in seconds, for the canary to continue making  regular
              runs  according  to the schedule in the Expression value. If you
              specify 0, the canary continues making runs until you  stop  it.
              If you omit this field, the default of 0 is used.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Expression=string,DurationInSeconds=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Expression": "string",
            "DurationInSeconds": long
          }

       --run-config (structure)
          A  structure  that  contains the timeout value that is used for each
          individual run of the canary.

          WARNING:
              The environment variables keys and values are not encrypted.  Do
              not store sensitive information in this field.

          TimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
              How  long  the canary is allowed to run before it must stop. You
              can't set this time to be longer than the frequency of the  runs
              of this canary.

              If  you  omit this field, the frequency of the canary is used as
              this value, up to a maximum of 14 minutes.

          MemoryInMB -> (integer)
              The maximum amount of memory available to the canary while it is
              running, in MB. This value must be a multiple of 64.

          ActiveTracing -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  this  canary  is to use active X-Ray tracing
              when it runs. Active tracing enables this canary run to be  dis-
              played in the ServiceLens and X-Ray service maps even if the ca-
              nary does not hit an endpoint that has  X-Ray  tracing  enabled.
              Using  X-Ray  tracing  incurs charges. For more information, see
              Canaries and X-Ray tracing .

              You can enable active tracing only for canaries that use version
              syn-nodejs-2.0 or later for their canary runtime.

          EnvironmentVariables -> (map)
              Specifies  the  keys and values to use for any environment vari-
              ables used in the canary script. Use the following format:

              { "key1" : "value1", "key2" : "value2", ...}

              Keys must start with a letter and be at  least  two  characters.
              The total size of your environment variables cannot exceed 4 KB.
              You can't specify any Lambda reserved environment  variables  as
              the  keys  for  your environment variables. For more information
              about reserved keys, see Runtime environment variables .

              WARNING:
                 The environment variables keys and values are not  encrypted.
                 Do not store sensitive information in this field.

       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
