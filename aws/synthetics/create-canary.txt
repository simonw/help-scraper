CREATE-CANARY()                                                CREATE-CANARY()



NAME
       create-canary -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a canary. Canaries are scripts that monitor your endpoints and
       APIs from the outside-in. Canaries help you check the availability  and
       latency  of your web services and troubleshoot anomalies by investigat-
       ing load time data, screenshots of the UI, logs, and metrics.  You  can
       set up a canary to run continuously or just once.

       Do  not use CreateCanary to modify an existing canary. Use UpdateCanary
       instead.

       To create canaries, you must  have  the  CloudWatchSyntheticsFullAccess
       policy.  If  you  are  creating a new IAM role for the canary, you also
       need the iam:CreateRole  ,  iam:CreatePolicy  and  iam:AttachRolePolicy
       permissions.  For more information, see Necessary Roles and Permissions
       .

       Do not include secrets or proprietary information in your canary names.
       The canary name makes up part of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the
       canary, and the ARN is included in outbound calls  over  the  internet.
       For  more  information,  see Security Considerations for Synthetics Ca-
       naries .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name for this canary. Be sure to give it a descriptive name that
          distinguishes it from other canaries in your account.

          Do  not  include  secrets  or proprietary information in your canary
          names. The canary name makes up part of the canary ARN, and the  ARN
          is  included  in outbound calls over the internet. For more informa-
          tion, see Security Considerations for Synthetics Canaries .

       --code (structure)
          A structure that includes the entry  point  from  which  the  canary
          should  start  running your script. If the script is stored in an S3
          bucket, the bucket name, key, and version are also included.

          S3Bucket -> (string)
              If your canary script is located in S3, specify the bucket  name
              here. Do not include s3:// as the start of the bucket name.

          S3Key -> (string)
              The  S3  key  of  your script. For more information, see Working
              with Amazon S3 Objects .

          S3Version -> (string)
              The S3 version ID of your script.

          ZipFile -> (blob)
              If you input your canary script directly into the canary instead
              of  referring  to an S3 location, the value of this parameter is
              the base64-encoded contents of the .zip file that  contains  the
              script. It must be smaller than 225 Kb.

              For  large canary scripts, we recommend that you use an S3 loca-
              tion instead of inputting it directly with this parameter.

          Handler -> (string)
              The entry point to use for the source code when running the  ca-
              nary.  For canaries that use the syn-python-selenium-1.0 runtime
              or a syn-nodejs.puppeteer runtime earlier  than  syn-nodejs.pup-
              peteer-3.4  , the handler must be specified as `` fileName .han-
              dler`` . For syn-python-selenium-1.1 ,  syn-nodejs.puppeteer-3.4
              ,  and  later runtimes, the handler can be specified as `` file-
              Name .*functionName* `` , or you can specify a folder where  ca-
              nary scripts reside as `` folder /fileName .*functionName* `` .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Bucket=string,S3Key=string,S3Version=string,ZipFile=blob,Handler=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Bucket": "string",
            "S3Key": "string",
            "S3Version": "string",
            "ZipFile": blob,
            "Handler": "string"
          }

       --artifact-s3-location (string)
          The location in Amazon S3 where Synthetics stores artifacts from the
          test runs of this canary. Artifacts include the  log  file,  screen-
          shots,  and HAR files. The name of the S3 bucket can't include a pe-
          riod (.).

       --execution-role-arn (string)
          The ARN of the IAM role to be used to run the canary. This role must
          already  exist, and must include lambda.amazonaws.com as a principal
          in the trust policy. The role must also have the  following  permis-
          sions:

          o s3:PutObject

          o s3:GetBucketLocation

          o s3:ListAllMyBuckets

          o cloudwatch:PutMetricData

          o logs:CreateLogGroup

          o logs:CreateLogStream

          o logs:PutLogEvents

       --schedule (structure)
          A  structure that contains information about how often the canary is
          to run and when these test runs are to stop.

          Expression -> (string)
              A rate expression or a cron expression that  defines  how  often
              the canary is to run.

              For a rate expression, The syntax is rate(*number unit* ) . unit
              can be minute , minutes , or hour .

              For example, rate(1 minute)  runs  the  canary  once  a  minute,
              rate(10 minutes) runs it once every 10 minutes, and rate(1 hour)
              runs it once every hour. You can  specify  a  frequency  between
              rate(1 minute) and rate(1 hour) .

              Specifying  rate(0  minute)  or  rate(0 hour) is a special value
              that causes the canary to run only once when it is started.

              Use cron(*expression* ) to specify a cron expression. You  can't
              schedule  a  canary to wait for more than a year before running.
              For information about  the  syntax  for  cron  expressions,  see
              Scheduling canary runs using cron .

          DurationInSeconds -> (long)
              How  long, in seconds, for the canary to continue making regular
              runs according to the schedule in the Expression value.  If  you
              specify  0,  the canary continues making runs until you stop it.
              If you omit this field, the default of 0 is used.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Expression=string,DurationInSeconds=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Expression": "string",
            "DurationInSeconds": long
          }

       --run-config (structure)
          A structure that contains the configuration  for  individual  canary
          runs, such as timeout value and environment variables.

          WARNING:
              The  environment variables keys and values are not encrypted. Do
              not store sensitive information in this field.

          TimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
              How long the canary is allowed to run before it must  stop.  You
              can't  set this time to be longer than the frequency of the runs
              of this canary.

              If you omit this field, the frequency of the canary is  used  as
              this value, up to a maximum of 14 minutes.

          MemoryInMB -> (integer)
              The maximum amount of memory available to the canary while it is
              running, in MB. This value must be a multiple of 64.

          ActiveTracing -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether this canary is to  use  active  X-Ray  tracing
              when  it runs. Active tracing enables this canary run to be dis-
              played in the ServiceLens and X-Ray service maps even if the ca-
              nary  does  not  hit an endpoint that has X-Ray tracing enabled.
              Using X-Ray tracing incurs charges. For  more  information,  see
              Canaries and X-Ray tracing .

              You can enable active tracing only for canaries that use version
              syn-nodejs-2.0 or later for their canary runtime.

          EnvironmentVariables -> (map)
              Specifies the keys and values to use for any  environment  vari-
              ables used in the canary script. Use the following format:

              { "key1" : "value1", "key2" : "value2", ...}

              Keys  must  start  with a letter and be at least two characters.
              The total size of your environment variables cannot exceed 4 KB.
              You  can't  specify any Lambda reserved environment variables as
              the keys for your environment variables.  For  more  information
              about reserved keys, see Runtime environment variables .

              WARNING:
                 The  environment variables keys and values are not encrypted.
                 Do not store sensitive information in this field.

          sociate as many as 50 tags with a canary.

          Tags  can  help  you organize and categorize your resources. You can
          also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user  permis-
          sion  to  access  or change only the resources that have certain tag
          values.

                 The  encryption  method  to use for artifacts created by this
                 canary. Specify SSE_S3 to use  server-side  encryption  (SSE)
                 with  an  Amazon  S3-managed  key.  Specify  SSE-KMS  to  use
                 server-side encryption with a customer-managed KMS key.

                 If you omit this parameter, an  Amazon  Web  Services-managed

            }
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

              .

          VpcConfig -> (structure)
              If this canary is to test an endpoint in a VPC,  this  structure
              contains  information  about  the subnets and security groups of
              the VPC endpoint. For more information, see Running a Canary  in
              a VPC .

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The IDs of the VPC where this canary is to run.

              SubnetIds -> (list)
                 The IDs of the subnets where this canary is to run.

                 (string)

              SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                 The IDs of the security groups for this canary.

                 (string)

          VisualReference -> (structure)
              If  this  canary performs visual monitoring by comparing screen-
              shots, this structure contains the ID of the canary run  to  use
              as  the  baseline  for  screenshots,  and the coordinates of any
              parts of the screen to ignore during the visual monitoring  com-
              parison.

              BaseScreenshots -> (list)
                 An  array  of  screenshots  that are used as the baseline for
                 comparisons during visual monitoring.

                 (structure)
                     A structure representing a screenshot that is used  as  a
                     baseline during visual monitoring comparisons made by the
                     canary.

                     ScreenshotName -> (string)
                        The name of the  screenshot.  This  is  generated  the
                        first  time  the  canary is run after the UpdateCanary
                        operation that specified for this  canary  to  perform
                        visual monitoring.

                     IgnoreCoordinates -> (list)
                        Coordinates that define the part of a screen to ignore
                        during screenshot comparisons. To obtain  the  coordi-
                        nates  to use here, use the CloudWatch console to draw
                        the boundaries on the screen.  For  more  information,
                        see Editing or deleting a canary

                        (string)

              BaseCanaryRunId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of the canary run that produced the baseline screen-
                 shots that are used for visual monitoring comparisons by this
                 canary.

          Tags -> (map)
              The list of key-value pairs that are associated with the canary.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          ArtifactConfig -> (structure)
              A  structure  that  contains  the configuration for canary arti-
              facts, including the encryption-at-rest settings  for  artifacts
              that the canary uploads to Amazon S3.

              S3Encryption -> (structure)
                 A  structure  that  contains  the configuration of encryption
                 settings for canary artifacts that are stored in Amazon S3.

                 EncryptionMode -> (string)
                     The encryption method to use  for  artifacts  created  by
                     this canary. Specify SSE_S3 to use server-side encryption
                     (SSE) with an Amazon S3-managed key. Specify  SSE-KMS  to
                     use  server-side  encryption  with a customer-managed KMS
                     key.

                     If you omit this parameter, an Amazon  Web  Services-man-
                     aged KMS key is used.

                 KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                     The  ARN  of  the customer-managed KMS key to use, if you
                     specify SSE-KMS for EncryptionMode
