GET-CANARY()                                                      GET-CANARY()



NAME
       get-canary -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  complete  information about one canary. You must specify the
       name of the canary that you want. To get a list of canaries  and  their
       names, use DescribeCanaries .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-canary
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the canary that you want details for.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Canary -> (structure)
          A strucure that contains the full information about the canary.

          Id -> (string)
              The unique ID of this canary.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the canary.

          Code -> (structure)
              This  structure  contains  information about the canary's Lambda
              handler and where its code is stored by CloudWatch Synthetics.

              SourceLocationArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the Lambda layer where Synthetics stores  the  ca-
                 nary script code.

              Handler -> (string)
                 The  entry  point to use for the source code when running the
                 canary.

          ExecutionRoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the IAM role used to run the canary. This  role  must
              include lambda.amazonaws.com as a principal in the trust policy.

          Schedule -> (structure)
              A structure that contains information about how often the canary
              is to run, and when these runs are to stop.

              Expression -> (string)
                 A rate expression or a cron expression that defines how often
                 the canary is to run.

                 For  a  rate expression, The syntax is rate(*number unit* ) .
                 unit can be minute , minutes , or hour .

                 For example, rate(1 minute) runs the canary  once  a  minute,
                 rate(10  minutes)  runs  it once every 10 minutes, and rate(1
                 hour) runs it once every hour. You can  specify  a  frequency
                 between rate(1 minute) and rate(1 hour) .

                 Specifying  rate(0 minute) or rate(0 hour) is a special value
                 that causes the canary to run only once when it is started.

                 Use cron(*expression* ) to specify a cron expression. For in-
                 formation   about   the  syntax  for  cron  expressions,  see
                 Scheduling canary runs using cron .

              DurationInSeconds -> (long)
                 How long, in seconds, for the canary to continue making regu-
                 lar runs after it was created. The runs are performed accord-
                 ing to the schedule in the Expression value.

          RunConfig -> (structure)
              A structure that contains information about a canary run.

              MemoryInMB -> (integer)
                 The maximum amount of memory available to the canary while it

              canary.

          FailureRetentionPeriodInDays -> (integer)
              The number of days to retain data about failed runs of this  ca-
              nary.
