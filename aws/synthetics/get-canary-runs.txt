NAME
       get-canary-runs -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a list of runs for a specified canary.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-canary-runs
          --name <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the canary that you want to see runs for.

       --next-token (string)
          A  token  that  indicates that there is more data available. You can
          use this token in a subsequent GetCanaryRuns operation  to  retrieve
          the next set of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specify this parameter to limit how many runs are returned each time
          you use the GetCanaryRuns operation. If you omit this parameter, the
          default of 100 is used.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CanaryRuns -> (list)
          An  array  of structures. Each structure contains the details of one
          of the retrieved canary runs.

          (structure)
              This structure contains the details about one run of one canary.

              Id -> (string)
                 A unique ID that identifies this canary run.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the canary.

              Status -> (structure)
                 The status of this run.

                 State -> (string)
                     The current state of the run.

                 StateReason -> (string)
                     If run of the canary failed, this field contains the rea-
                     son for the error.

                 StateReasonCode -> (string)
                     If  this  value is CANARY_FAILURE , an exception occurred
                     in the canary code. If this value is EXECUTION_FAILURE  ,
                     an exception occurred in CloudWatch Synthetics.

              Timeline -> (structure)
                 A  structure  that  contains  the start and end times of this
                 run.

                 Started -> (timestamp)
                     The start time of the run.

                 Completed -> (timestamp)
                     The end time of the run.

              ArtifactS3Location -> (string)
                 The location where the canary stored artifacts from the  run.
                 Artifacts include the log file, screenshots, and HAR files.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates that there is more data available. You can
          use this token in a subsequent GetCanaryRuns operation  to  retrieve
          the next set of results.
