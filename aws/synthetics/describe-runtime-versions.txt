DESCRIBE-RUNTIME-VERSIONS()                        DESCRIBE-RUNTIME-VERSIONS()



NAME
       describe-runtime-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of Synthetics canary runtime versions. For more informa-
       tion, see Canary Runtime Versions .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-runtime-versions
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          A token that indicates that there is more data  available.  You  can
          use  this token in a subsequent DescribeRuntimeVersions operation to
          retrieve the next set of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specify this parameter to limit how many runs are returned each time
          you  use the DescribeRuntimeVersions operation. If you omit this pa-
          rameter, the default of 100 is used.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RuntimeVersions -> (list)
          An array of objects that display the details about  each  Synthetics
          canary runtime version.

          (structure)
              This  structure  contains  information  about one canary runtime
              version. For more information about runtime versions, see Canary
              Runtime Versions .

              VersionName -> (string)
                 The  name of the runtime version. For a list of valid runtime
                 versions, see Canary Runtime Versions .

              Description -> (string)
                 A description of the runtime version, created by Amazon.

              ReleaseDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date that the runtime version was released.

              DeprecationDate -> (timestamp)
                 If this runtime version is deprecated, this value is the date
                 of deprecation.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates that there is more data available. You can
          use this token in a subsequent DescribeRuntimeVersions operation  to
          retrieve the next set of results.
