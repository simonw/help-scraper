DESCRIBE-STREAM()                                            DESCRIBE-STREAM()



NAME
       describe-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified Kinesis data stream.

       NOTE:
          This  API has been revised. It's highly recommended that you use the
          DescribeStreamSummary API to get a  summarized  description  of  the
          specified  Kinesis  data  stream and the  ListShards API to list the
          shards in a specified data stream and obtain information about  each
          shard.

       The information returned includes the stream name, Amazon Resource Name
       (ARN), creation time, enhanced metric configuration, and shard map. The
       shard map is an array of shard objects. For each shard object, there is
       the hash key and sequence number ranges that the shard spans,  and  the
       IDs  of any earlier shards that played in a role in creating the shard.
       Every record ingested in the stream is identified by a sequence number,
       which is assigned when the record is put into the stream.

       You  can limit the number of shards returned by each call. For more in-
       formation, see Retrieving Shards from a Stream in  the  Amazon  Kinesis
       Data Streams Developer Guide .

       There  are no guarantees about the chronological order shards returned.
       To process shards in chronological order, use  the  ID  of  the  parent
       shard to track the lineage to the oldest shard.

       This operation has a limit of 10 transactions per second per account.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-stream is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: StreamDescription.Shards

SYNOPSIS
            describe-stream
          --stream-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stream-name (string)
          The name of the stream to describe.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       StreamDescription -> (structure)
          The  current  status  of the stream, the stream Amazon Resource Name
          (ARN), an array of shard  objects  that  comprise  the  stream,  and
          whether there are more shards available.

          StreamName -> (string)
              The name of the stream being described.

          StreamARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the stream being described.

          StreamStatus -> (string)
              The  current  status  of  the stream being described. The stream
              status is one of the following states:

              o CREATING - The stream is being created. Kinesis  Data  Streams
                immediately returns and sets StreamStatus to CREATING .

              o DELETING  -  The stream is being deleted. The specified stream
                is in the DELETING state until Kinesis Data Streams  completes
                the deletion.

              o ACTIVE - The stream exists and is ready for read and write op-
                erations or deletion. You should perform read and write opera-
                tions only on an ACTIVE stream.

              o UPDATING  -  Shards  in  the stream are being merged or split.
                Read and write operations continue to work while the stream is
                in the UPDATING state.

          StreamModeDetails -> (structure)
              Specifies  the  capacity mode to which you want to set your data
              stream. Currently, in Kinesis Data Streams, you can  choose  be-
              tween an on-demand capacity mode and a provisioned capacity mode
              for your data streams.

              StreamMode -> (string)
                 Specifies the capacity mode to which you  want  to  set  your
                 data  stream.  Currently,  in  Kinesis  Data Streams, you can
                 choose between an on-demand capacity mode and  a  provisioned
                 capacity mode for your data streams.

                     The shard ID of the shard's parent.

                 AdjacentParentShardId -> (string)
                     The shard ID of the shard adjacent to the shard's parent.

                 HashKeyRange -> (structure)
                     The range of possible hash  key  values  for  the  shard,
                     which is a set of ordered contiguous positive integers.

                     StartingHashKey -> (string)
                        The starting hash key of the hash key range.

                     EndingHashKey -> (string)
                        The ending hash key of the hash key range.

                 SequenceNumberRange -> (structure)

                     EndingSequenceNumber -> (string)
                        The  ending sequence number for the range. Shards that
                        are in the OPEN state have an ending  sequence  number
                        of null .

          HasMoreShards -> (boolean)
              If  set to true , more shards in the stream are available to de-
              scribe.

          RetentionPeriodHours -> (integer)
              The current retention period, in hours.  Minimum  value  of  24.

                     The following are  the  valid  shard-level  metrics.  The
                     value "ALL " enhances every metric.

                     o IncomingBytes

                     o IncomingRecords

                     o OutgoingBytes

          EncryptionType -> (string)
              The server-side encryption type used on the stream. This parame-
              ter can be one of the following values:

              o NONE : Do not encrypt the records in the stream.

              o KMS : Use server-side encryption on the records in the  stream
                using a customer-managed Amazon Web Services KMS key.

          KeyId -> (string)
              The GUID for the customer-managed Amazon Web Services KMS key to
              use for encryption. This value can be a globally unique  identi-
              fier,  a  fully specified ARN to either an alias or a key, or an
              alias name prefixed by "alias/".You can also use  a  master  key
              owned  by Kinesis Data Streams by specifying the alias aws/kine-
              sis .

              o Key                        ARN                        example:
