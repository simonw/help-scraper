REGISTER-STREAM-CONSUMER()                          REGISTER-STREAM-CONSUMER()



NAME
       register-stream-consumer -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers  a consumer with a Kinesis data stream. When you use this op-
       eration, the consumer you register can then call   SubscribeToShard  to
       receive data from the stream using enhanced fan-out, at a rate of up to
       2 MiB per second for every shard you subscribe to. This rate  is  unaf-
       fected by the total number of consumers that read from the same stream.

       You  can  register  up to 20 consumers per stream. A given consumer can
       only be registered with one stream at a time.

       For an example of how to use this operations, see Enhanced Fan-Out  Us-
       ing the Kinesis Data Streams API .

       The  use  of this operation has a limit of five transactions per second
       per account. Also, only 5 consumers can be created  simultaneously.  In
       other words, you cannot have more than 5 consumers in a CREATING status
       at the same time. Registering a 6th consumer while there  are  5  in  a
       CREATING status results in a LimitExceededException .

SYNOPSIS
            register-stream-consumer
          --stream-arn <value>
          --consumer-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stream-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of  the  Kinesis data stream that you want to register the
          consumer with. For more info, see Amazon Resource Names  (ARNs)  and
          Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces .

       --consumer-name (string)
          For  a  given  Kinesis data stream, each consumer must have a unique
          name. However, consumer names don't have to be  unique  across  data
          streams.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To register a data stream consumer

       The  following  register-stream-consumer  example  registers a consumer
       called KinesisConsumerApplication with the specified data stream.

          aws kinesis register-stream-consumer \
              --stream-arn arn:aws:kinesis:us-west-2:012345678912:stream/samplestream \
              --consumer-name KinesisConsumerApplication

       Output:

          {
              "Consumer": {
                  "ConsumerName": "KinesisConsumerApplication",
                  "ConsumerARN": "arn:aws:kinesis:us-west-2: 123456789012:stream/samplestream/consumer/KinesisConsumerApplication:1572383852",
                  "ConsumerStatus": "CREATING",
                  "ConsumerCreationTimestamp": 1572383852.0
              }
          }

       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       Consumer -> (structure)
          An object that represents the details of  the  consumer  you  regis-
          tered.  When  you register a consumer, it gets an ARN that is gener-
          ated by Kinesis Data Streams.

          ConsumerName -> (string)
              The name of the consumer is something you choose when you regis-
              ter the consumer.

          ConsumerARN -> (string)
              When  you register a consumer, Kinesis Data Streams generates an
              ARN for it. You need this ARN  to  be  able  to  call   Subscri-
              beToShard .

              If you delete a consumer and then create a new one with the same
              name, it won't have the same ARN. That's because  consumer  ARNs
              contain  the  creation  timestamp.  This is important to keep in
              mind if you have IAM policies that reference consumer ARNs.

          ConsumerStatus -> (string)
              A consumer can't read data while in  the  CREATING  or  DELETING
              states.

          ConsumerCreationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
