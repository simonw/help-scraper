LIST-STREAM-CONSUMERS()                                LIST-STREAM-CONSUMERS()



NAME
       list-stream-consumers -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the consumers registered to receive data from a stream using en-
       hanced fan-out, and provides information about each consumer.

       This operation has a limit of 5 transactions per second per stream.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-stream-consumers is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Consumers

SYNOPSIS
            list-stream-consumers
          --stream-arn <value>
          [--stream-creation-timestamp <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stream-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of  the Kinesis data stream for which you want to list the
          registered consumers. For  more  information,  see  Amazon  Resource
          Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces .

       --stream-creation-timestamp (timestamp)
          Specify  this  input parameter to distinguish data streams that have
          the same name. For example, if you create a  data  stream  and  then
          delete  it,  and  you later create another data stream with the same
          name, you can use this input parameter to specify which of  the  two
          streams you want to list the consumers for.

          You can't specify this parameter if you specify the NextToken param-
          eter.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Consumers -> (list)
          An array of JSON objects. Each object represents one registered con-
          sumer.

          (structure)
              An object that represents the details of the consumer you regis-
              tered. This type of object is  returned  by   RegisterStreamCon-
              sumer .

              ConsumerName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  consumer is something you choose when you
                 register the consumer.

              ConsumerARN -> (string)
                 When you register a consumer, Kinesis Data Streams  generates
                 an ARN for it. You need this ARN to be able to call  Subscri-
                 beToShard .

                 If you delete a consumer and then create a new one  with  the
                 same  name,  it  won't have the same ARN. That's because con-
                 sumer ARNs contain the creation timestamp. This is  important
                 to  keep in mind if you have IAM policies that reference con-
                 sumer ARNs.

              ConsumerStatus -> (string)
                 A consumer can't read data while in the CREATING or  DELETING
                 states.

              ConsumerCreationTimestamp -> (timestamp)

       NextToken -> (string)
          When  the  number  of  consumers  that  are registered with the data
          stream is greater than the default value for the MaxResults  parame-
          ter,  or  if  you  explicitly specify a value for MaxResults that is
          less than the number of registered consumers, the response  includes
          a  pagination token named NextToken . You can specify this NextToken
          value in a subsequent call to ListStreamConsumers to list  the  next
          set  of  registered consumers. For more information about the use of
          this pagination token when calling  the  ListStreamConsumers  opera-
          tion, see  ListStreamConsumersInput$NextToken .

          WARNING:
              Tokens  expire  after  300  seconds. When you obtain a value for
              NextToken in the response to a call to ListStreamConsumers , you
              have  300  seconds  to use that value. If you specify an expired
              token in a call to ListStreamConsumers , you get  ExpiredNextTo-
              kenException .
