MERGE-SHARDS()                                                  MERGE-SHARDS()



NAME
       merge-shards -

DESCRIPTION
       Merges  two  adjacent shards in a Kinesis data stream and combines them
       into a single shard to reduce  the  stream's  capacity  to  ingest  and
       transport  data. Two shards are considered adjacent if the union of the
       hash key ranges for the two shards form a contiguous set with no  gaps.
       For  example,  if  you  have  two  shards, one with a hash key range of
       276...381 and the other with a hash key range of  382...454,  then  you
       could merge these two shards into a single shard that would have a hash
       key range of 276...454. After the merge, the  single  child  shard  re-
       ceives data for all hash key values covered by the two parent shards.
          MergeShards is called when there is a need to reduce the overall ca-
          pacity of a stream because of excess  capacity  that  is  not  being
          used. You must specify the shard to be merged and the adjacent shard
          for a stream. For more information about merging shards,  see  Merge
          Two Shards in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide .

       If  the  stream is in the ACTIVE state, you can call MergeShards . If a
       stream is in the CREATING , UPDATING , or DELETING  state,  MergeShards
       returns a ResourceInUseException . If the specified stream does not ex-
       ist, MergeShards returns a ResourceNotFoundException .

       You can use  DescribeStreamSummary to check the state  of  the  stream,
       which is returned in StreamStatus .
          MergeShards  is  an  asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a Merge-
          Shards request, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams  immediately  returns  a
          response and sets the StreamStatus to UPDATING . After the operation
          is completed, Kinesis Data Streams sets the StreamStatus to ACTIVE .
          Read  and  write  operations continue to work while the stream is in
          the UPDATING state.

       You use  DescribeStreamSummary and the  ListShards  APIs  to  determine
       the shard IDs that are specified in the MergeShards request.

       If  you  try  to  operate on too many streams in parallel using  Creat-
       eStream ,  DeleteStream , MergeShards , or  SplitShard , you receive  a
       LimitExceededException .
          MergeShards has a limit of five transactions per second per account.

SYNOPSIS
            merge-shards
          --stream-name <value>
          --shard-to-merge <value>
          --adjacent-shard-to-merge <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stream-name (string)
          The name of the stream for the merge.

       --shard-to-merge (string)
          The shard ID of the shard to combine with the adjacent shard for the
          merge.

       --adjacent-shard-to-merge (string)
          The shard ID of the adjacent shard for the merge.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To merge shards

       The  following merge-shards example merges two adjacent shards with IDs
       of shardId-000000000000  and shardId-000000000001 in the specified data
       stream and combines them into a single shard.

          aws kinesis merge-shards \
              --stream-name samplestream \
              --shard-to-merge shardId-000000000000 \
              --adjacent-shard-to-merge shardId-000000000001

       This command produces no output.

       Streams Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
