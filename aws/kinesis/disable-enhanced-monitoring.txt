NAME
       disable-enhanced-monitoring -

DESCRIPTION
       Disables enhanced monitoring.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disable-enhanced-monitoring
          --stream-name <value>
          --shard-level-metrics <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stream-name (string)
          The  name  of  the Kinesis data stream for which to disable enhanced
          monitoring.

       --shard-level-metrics (list)
          List of shard-level metrics to disable.

          The following are the valid shard-level metrics. The  value  "ALL  "
          disables every metric.

          o IncomingBytes

          o IncomingRecords

          o OutgoingBytes

          o OutgoingRecords

          o WriteProvisionedThroughputExceeded

          o ReadProvisionedThroughputExceeded

          o IteratorAgeMilliseconds

          o ALL

          For more information, see Monitoring the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
          Service with Amazon CloudWatch in the Amazon  Kinesis  Data  Streams
          Developer Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            IncomingBytes
            IncomingRecords
            OutgoingBytes
            OutgoingRecords
            WriteProvisionedThroughputExceeded
            ReadProvisionedThroughputExceeded
            IteratorAgeMilliseconds
            ALL

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To disable enhanced monitoring for shard-level metrics

       The following disable-enhanced-monitoring example disables enhanced Ki-
       nesis data stream monitoring for shard-level metrics.

          aws kinesis disable-enhanced-monitoring \
              --stream-name samplestream --shard-level-metrics ALL

       Output:

          {
              "StreamName": "samplestream",
              "CurrentShardLevelMetrics": [
                  "IncomingBytes",
                  "OutgoingRecords",
                  "IteratorAgeMilliseconds",
                  "IncomingRecords",
                  "ReadProvisionedThroughputExceeded",
                  "WriteProvisionedThroughputExceeded",
                  "OutgoingBytes"
              ],
              "DesiredShardLevelMetrics": []
          }

OUTPUT
       StreamName -> (string)
          The name of the Kinesis data stream.

       CurrentShardLevelMetrics -> (list)
          Represents the current state of the metrics that are in the enhanced
          state before the operation.

          (string)

       DesiredShardLevelMetrics -> (list)
          Represents the list of all the metrics that would be in the enhanced
          state after the operation.

          (string)
