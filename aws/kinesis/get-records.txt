GET-RECORDS()                                                    GET-RECORDS()



NAME
       get-records -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets data records from a Kinesis data stream's shard.

       Specify  a  shard iterator using the ShardIterator parameter. The shard
       iterator specifies the position in the shard from  which  you  want  to
       start reading data records sequentially. If there are no records avail-
       able in the portion of the shard that  the  iterator  points  to,   Ge-
       tRecords  returns an empty list. It might take multiple calls to get to
       a portion of the shard that contains records.

       You can scale by provisioning multiple shards per stream while  consid-
       ering  service  limits  (for  more information, see Amazon Kinesis Data
       Streams Limits in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams  Developer  Guide  ).
       Your application should have one thread per shard, each reading contin-
       uously from its stream. To read from a stream  continually,  call   Ge-
       tRecords  in a loop. Use  GetShardIterator to get the shard iterator to
       specify in the first  GetRecords call.  GetRecords returns a new  shard
       iterator  in NextShardIterator . Specify the shard iterator returned in
       NextShardIterator in subsequent calls to  GetRecords . If the shard has
       been  closed, the shard iterator can't return more data and  GetRecords
       returns null in NextShardIterator . You can terminate the loop when the
       shard is closed, or when the shard iterator reaches the record with the
       sequence number or other attribute that marks it as the last record  to
       process.

       Each data record can be up to 1 MiB in size, and each shard can read up
       to 2 MiB per second. You can ensure that your calls  don't  exceed  the
       maximum  supported  size  or throughput by using the Limit parameter to
       specify the maximum number of records that  GetRecords can return. Con-
       sider your average record size when determining this limit. The maximum
       number of records that can be returned per call is 10,000.

       The size of the data returned by  GetRecords varies  depending  on  the
       utilization  of the shard. It is recommended that consumer applications
       retrieve records via the GetRecords command using the 5  TPS  limit  to
       remain  caught  up. Retrieving records less frequently can lead to con-
       sumer applications falling behind. The maximum size of data  that   Ge-
       tRecords  can  return is 10 MiB. If a call returns this amount of data,
       subsequent  calls  made  within  the  next  5  seconds   throw   Provi-
       sionedThroughputExceededException  .  If  there  is insufficient provi-
       sioned throughput on the stream, subsequent calls made within the  next
       1  second  throw  ProvisionedThroughputExceededException  .  GetRecords
       doesn't return any data when it throws an exception. For  this  reason,
       we recommend that you wait 1 second between calls to  GetRecords . How-
       ever, it's possible that the application will get exceptions for longer
       than 1 second.

       To  detect whether the application is falling behind in processing, you
       can use the MillisBehindLatest response attribute. You can also monitor
       the   stream   using  CloudWatch  metrics  and  other  mechanisms  (see
       Monitoring in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide ).

       Each Amazon Kinesis record includes a  value,  ApproximateArrivalTimes-
       tamp  ,  that  is  set when a stream successfully receives and stores a
       record. This is commonly referred  to  as  a  server-side  time  stamp,
       whereas a client-side time stamp is set when a data producer creates or
       sends the record to a stream  (a  data  producer  is  any  data  source
       putting data records into a stream, for example with  PutRecords ). The
       time stamp has millisecond precision. There are no guarantees about the
       time  stamp  accuracy, or that the time stamp is always increasing. For
       example, records in a shard or across a stream might have  time  stamps
       that are out of order.

       This operation has a limit of five transactions per second per shard.

OPTIONS
       --shard-iterator (string)
          The  position in the shard from which you want to start sequentially
          reading data records. A shard iterator specifies this position using
          the sequence number of a data record in the shard.

       --limit (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of records to return. Specify a value of up to
          10,000. If you specify a value that is  greater  than  10,000,   Ge-
          tRecords  throws  InvalidArgumentException  .  The  default value is
          10,000.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To obtain records from a shard

       The following get-records example gets data records from a Kinesis data
       stream's shard using the specified shard iterator.

OUTPUT
       Records -> (list)
          The data records retrieved from the shard.

          (structure)
              The  unit  of data of the Kinesis data stream, which is composed
              of a sequence number, a partition key, and a data blob.

              SequenceNumber -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the record within its shard.

              ApproximateArrivalTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The approximate time that the record was  inserted  into  the
                 stream.

              Data -> (blob)
                 The  data  blob.  The data in the blob is both opaque and im-
                 mutable to Kinesis Data Streams, which does not inspect,  in-
                 terpret,  or change the data in the blob in any way. When the
                 data blob (the payload before base64-encoding)  is  added  to
                 the  partition  key  size, the total size must not exceed the
                 maximum record size (1 MiB).

              PartitionKey -> (string)
                 Identifies which shard in the stream the data record  is  as-
                 signed to.

              EncryptionType -> (string)
                 The encryption type used on the record. This parameter can be
                 one of the following values:

                 o NONE : Do not encrypt the records in the stream.

                 o KMS : Use server-side encryption  on  the  records  in  the
                   stream  using  a  customer-managed  Amazon Web Services KMS
                   key.

       NextShardIterator -> (string)
          The next position in the shard  from  which  to  start  sequentially
          reading data records. If set to null , the shard has been closed and
          the requested iterator does not return any more data.

       MillisBehindLatest -> (long)
          The number of milliseconds the  GetRecords response is from the  tip
          of  the  stream, indicating how far behind current time the consumer
          is. A value of zero indicates that record processing is  caught  up,
          and there are no new records to process at this moment.

       ChildShards -> (list)
          The  list  of  the current shard's child shards, returned in the Ge-
          tRecords API's response only when the end of the  current  shard  is
          reached.

          (structure)
              Output parameter of the GetRecords API. The existing child shard
              of the current shard.

              ShardId -> (string)
                 The shard ID of the  existing  child  shard  of  the  current
                 shard.

              ParentShards -> (list)
                 The  current  shard  that is the parent of the existing child
                 shard.

                 (string)

              HashKeyRange -> (structure)
                 The range of possible hash key values for the shard, which is
                 a set of ordered contiguous positive integers.

                 StartingHashKey -> (string)
                     The starting hash key of the hash key range.

                 EndingHashKey -> (string)
                     The ending hash key of the hash key range.
