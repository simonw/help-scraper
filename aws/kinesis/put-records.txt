PUT-RECORDS()                                                    PUT-RECORDS()



NAME
       put-records -

DESCRIPTION
       Writes  multiple  data  records  into a Kinesis data stream in a single
       call (also referred to as a PutRecords request). Use this operation  to
       send data into the stream for data ingestion and processing.

       Each  PutRecords  request can support up to 500 records. Each record in
       the request can be as large as 1 MiB, up to a limit of 5  MiB  for  the
       entire request, including partition keys. Each shard can support writes
       up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total  of  1
       MiB per second.

       You  must  specify  the  name  of the stream that captures, stores, and
       transports the data; and an array of request Records , with each record
       in  the  array requiring a partition key and data blob. The record size
       limit applies to the total size of the partition key and data blob.

       The data blob can be any type of data; for example, a  segment  from  a
       log  file,  geographic/location  data, website clickstream data, and so
       on.

       The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams as input  to  a  hash
       function  that maps the partition key and associated data to a specific
       shard. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition  keys  to  128-bit
       integer  values  and to map associated data records to shards. As a re-
       sult of this hashing mechanism, all data records with the  same  parti-
       tion key map to the same shard within the stream. For more information,
       see Adding Data to a Stream in the Amazon Kinesis Data  Streams  Devel-
       oper Guide .

       Each record in the Records array may include an optional parameter, Ex-
       plicitHashKey , which overrides the partition  key  to  shard  mapping.
       This parameter allows a data producer to determine explicitly the shard
       where the record is stored. For more information, see  Adding  Multiple
       Records  with  PutRecords  in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer
       Guide .

       The PutRecords response includes an array of response  Records  .  Each
       record  in  the response array directly correlates with a record in the
       request array using natural ordering, from the top to the bottom of the
       request  and  response.  The response Records array always includes the
       same number of records as the request array.

       The response Records array includes both  successfully  and  unsuccess-
       fully  processed  records. Kinesis Data Streams attempts to process all
       records in each PutRecords request. A single record  failure  does  not
       stop  the  processing  of  subsequent  records. As a result, PutRecords
       doesn't guarantee the ordering of records. If you need to read  records
       in  the  same  order they are written to the stream, use  PutRecord in-
       stead of PutRecords , and write to the same shard.

       A successfully processed record  includes  ShardId  and  SequenceNumber
       values.  The ShardId parameter identifies the shard in the stream where
       the record is stored. The SequenceNumber parameter is an identifier as-
       signed to the put record, unique to all records in the stream.

       An  unsuccessfully processed record includes ErrorCode and ErrorMessage
       values. ErrorCode reflects the type of error and can be one of the fol-
       lowing  values: ProvisionedThroughputExceededException or InternalFail-
       ure . ErrorMessage provides more detailed information about the  Provi-
       sionedThroughputExceededException  exception  including the account ID,
       stream name, and shard ID of the record that was  throttled.  For  more
       information  about  partially successful responses, see Adding Multiple
       Records with PutRecords in the Amazon Kinesis  Data  Streams  Developer
       Guide .

       WARNING:
          After  you write a record to a stream, you cannot modify that record
          or its order within the stream.

       By default, data records are accessible for 24 hours from the time that
       they  are added to a stream. You can use  IncreaseStreamRetentionPeriod
       or  DecreaseStreamRetentionPeriod to modify this retention period.

SYNOPSIS
            put-records
          --records <value>
          --stream-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --records (list)
          The records associated with the request.

          (structure)
              Represents the output for PutRecords .

              Data -> (blob)
                 The data blob to put into the record, which is base64-encoded
                 when  the blob is serialized. When the data blob (the payload
                 before base64-encoding) is added to the partition  key  size,
                 the  total  size  must  not exceed the maximum record size (1
                 MiB).

              ExplicitHashKey -> (string)
                 The hash value used to determine explicitly  the  shard  that
                 the  data  record  is assigned to by overriding the partition
                 key hash.

              PartitionKey -> (string)
                 Determines which shard in the stream the data record  is  as-
                 signed  to. Partition keys are Unicode strings with a maximum
                 length limit of 256 characters for each key.  Amazon  Kinesis
                 Data  Streams uses the partition key as input to a hash func-
                 tion that maps the partition key and  associated  data  to  a
                 specific shard. Specifically, an MD5 hash function is used to
                 map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map asso-
                 ciated  data  records  to shards. As a result of this hashing
                 mechanism, all data records with the same partition  key  map
                 to the same shard within the stream.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Data=blob,ExplicitHashKey=string,PartitionKey=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Data": blob,
              "ExplicitHashKey": "string",
              "PartitionKey": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --stream-name (string)
          The stream name associated with the request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To write multiple records into a data stream

       The following put-records example writes a data record using the speci-
       fied partition key and another data record using a different  partition
       key in a single call.

          aws kinesis put-records \
              --stream-name samplestream \
              --records Data=blob1,PartitionKey=partitionkey1 Data=blob2,PartitionKey=partitionkey2

       Output:

          {
              "FailedRecordCount": 0,
              "Records": [
                  {
                      "SequenceNumber": "49600883331171471519674795588238531498465399900093808706",
                      "ShardId": "shardId-000000000004"
                  },
                  {
                      "SequenceNumber": "49600902273357540915989931256902715169698037101720764562",
                      "ShardId": "shardId-000000000009"
                  }
              ],
              "EncryptionType": "KMS"
          }

OUTPUT
       FailedRecordCount -> (integer)
          The  number  of unsuccessfully processed records in a PutRecords re-
          quest.

       Records -> (list)
          An array of successfully and  unsuccessfully  processed  record  re-
          sults.  A record that is successfully added to a stream includes Se-
          quenceNumber and ShardId in the result. A record that  fails  to  be
          added to a stream includes ErrorCode and ErrorMessage in the result.

          (structure)
              Represents  the result of an individual record from a PutRecords
              request. A record that is successfully added  to  a  stream  in-
              cludes  SequenceNumber  and ShardId in the result. A record that
              fails to be added to the stream includes ErrorCode and ErrorMes-
              sage in the result.

              SequenceNumber -> (string)
                 The sequence number for an individual record result.

              ShardId -> (string)
                 The shard ID for an individual record result.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The  error  code  for an individual record result. ErrorCodes
                 can be either ProvisionedThroughputExceededException  or  In-
                 ternalFailure .

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 The  error message for an individual record result. An Error-
                 Code value of ProvisionedThroughputExceededException  has  an
                 error  message that includes the account ID, stream name, and
                 shard ID. An ErrorCode value of InternalFailure has the error
                 message "Internal Service Failure" .

       EncryptionType -> (string)
          The  encryption  type used on the records. This parameter can be one
          of the following values:

          o NONE : Do not encrypt the records.

          o KMS : Use server-side encryption  on  the  records  using  a  cus-
            tomer-managed Amazon Web Services KMS key.



                                                                 PUT-RECORDS()
