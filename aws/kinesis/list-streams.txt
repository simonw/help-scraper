LIST-STREAMS()                                                  LIST-STREAMS()



NAME
       list-streams -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists your Kinesis data streams.

       The  number of streams may be too large to return from a single call to
       ListStreams . You can limit the number of returned  streams  using  the
       Limit parameter. If you do not specify a value for the Limit parameter,
       Kinesis Data Streams uses the default limit, which is currently 100.

       You can detect if there are more streams available to list by using the
       HasMoreStreams flag from the returned output. If there are more streams
       available, you can request more streams by using the name of  the  last
       stream returned by the ListStreams request in the ExclusiveStartStream-
       Name parameter in a subsequent request to ListStreams .  The  group  of
       stream  names  returned  by the subsequent request is then added to the
       list. You can continue this process until all  the  stream  names  have
       been collected in the list.
          ListStreams has a limit of five transactions per second per account.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-streams is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: StreamNames

SYNOPSIS
            list-streams
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list data streams

       The following list-streams example lists all active data streams in the
       current account and region.

          aws kinesis list-streams

       Output:

          {
              "StreamNames": [
                  "samplestream",
                  "samplestream1"
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Listing Streams in the  Amazon  Kinesis  Data
       Streams Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       StreamNames -> (list)
          The  names  of  the  streams that are associated with the Amazon Web
          Services account making the ListStreams request.

          (string)

       HasMoreStreams -> (boolean)
          If set to true , there are more streams available to list.
