DELETE-STREAM()                                                DELETE-STREAM()



NAME
       delete-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  Kinesis  data  stream and all its shards and data. You must
       shut down any applications that are operating on the stream before  you
       delete  the  stream. If an application attempts to operate on a deleted
       stream, it receives the exception ResourceNotFoundException .

       If the stream is in the ACTIVE  state,  you  can  delete  it.  After  a
       DeleteStream request, the specified stream is in the DELETING state un-
       til Kinesis Data Streams completes the deletion.
          Note: Kinesis Data Streams might continue to accept  data  read  and
          write operations, such as  PutRecord ,  PutRecords , and  GetRecords
          , on a stream in the DELETING state until  the  stream  deletion  is
          complete.

       When  you  delete a stream, any shards in that stream are also deleted,
       and any tags are dissociated from the stream.

       You can use the  DescribeStreamSummary operation to check the state  of
       the stream, which is returned in StreamStatus .
          DeleteStream  has  a  limit  of five transactions per second per ac-
          count.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-stream
          --stream-name <value>
          [--enforce-consumer-deletion | --no-enforce-consumer-deletion]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stream-name (string)
          The name of the stream to delete.

       --enforce-consumer-deletion | --no-enforce-consumer-deletion (boolean)
          If this parameter is unset (null ) or if you set it to false  ,  and
          the  stream has registered consumers, the call to DeleteStream fails
          with a ResourceInUseException .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete a data stream

       The following delete-stream example deletes the specified data stream.

          aws kinesis delete-stream \
              --stream-name samplestream

       This command produces no output.

       Streams Developer Guide.
