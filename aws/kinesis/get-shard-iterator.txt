GET-SHARD-ITERATOR()                                      GET-SHARD-ITERATOR()



NAME
       get-shard-iterator -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  an Amazon Kinesis shard iterator. A shard iterator expires 5 min-
       utes after it is returned to the requester.

       A shard iterator specifies the shard position from which to start read-
       ing  data records sequentially. The position is specified using the se-
       quence number of a data record in a shard. A  sequence  number  is  the
       identifier  associated with every record ingested in the stream, and is
       assigned when a record is put into the stream. Each stream has  one  or
       more shards.

       You  must specify the shard iterator type. For example, you can set the
       ShardIteratorType parameter to read exactly from the  position  denoted
       by a specific sequence number by using the AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER shard it-
       erator type. Alternatively, the parameter can read right after the  se-
       quence  number  by using the AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER shard iterator type,
       using sequence numbers returned by earlier calls to  PutRecord  ,   Pu-
       tRecords  ,   GetRecords , or  DescribeStream . In the request, you can
       specify the shard iterator type AT_TIMESTAMP to read  records  from  an
       arbitrary  point  in time, TRIM_HORIZON to cause ShardIterator to point
       to the last untrimmed record in the shard in  the  system  (the  oldest
       data  record  in the shard), or LATEST so that you always read the most
       recent data in the shard.

       When you read repeatedly from a stream, use a  GetShardIterator request
       to  get  the first shard iterator for use in your first  GetRecords re-
       quest and for subsequent reads use the shard iterator returned  by  the
       GetRecords  request  in NextShardIterator . A new shard iterator is re-
       turned by every  GetRecords request in NextShardIterator  ,  which  you
       use in the ShardIterator parameter of the next  GetRecords request.

       If  a  GetShardIterator request is made too often, you receive a Provi-
       sionedThroughputExceededException . For more information about through-
       put  limits, see  GetRecords , and Streams Limits in the Amazon Kinesis
       Data Streams Developer Guide .

       If the shard is closed,  GetShardIterator returns a valid iterator  for
       the  last  sequence number of the shard. A shard can be closed as a re-
       sult of using  SplitShard or  MergeShards .
          GetShardIterator has a limit of five transactions per second per ac-
          count per open shard.

SYNOPSIS
            get-shard-iterator
          --stream-name <value>
          --shard-id <value>
          --shard-iterator-type <value>
          [--starting-sequence-number <value>]
          [--timestamp <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stream-name (string)
          The name of the Amazon Kinesis data stream.

       --shard-id (string)
          The  shard  ID of the Kinesis Data Streams shard to get the iterator
          for.

       --shard-iterator-type (string)
          Determines how the shard iterator is  used  to  start  reading  data
          records from the shard.

          The following are the valid Amazon Kinesis shard iterator types:

          o AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER  - Start reading from the position denoted by a
            specific sequence number, provided in  the  value  StartingSequen-
            ceNumber .

          o AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER - Start reading right after the position de-
            noted by a specific sequence number, provided in the value  Start-
            ingSequenceNumber .

          o AT_TIMESTAMP  -  Start reading from the position denoted by a spe-
            cific time stamp, provided in the value Timestamp .

          o TRIM_HORIZON - Start reading at the last untrimmed record  in  the
            shard in the system, which is the oldest data record in the shard.

          o LATEST  -  Start  reading just after the most recent record in the
            shard, so that you always read the most recent data in the shard.

          Possible values:

          o AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER

          o AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER

          o TRIM_HORIZON

          o LATEST

          o AT_TIMESTAMP

       --starting-sequence-number (string)
          The sequence number of the data record in the shard  from  which  to
          start  reading. Used with shard iterator type AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER and
          AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER.

       --timestamp (timestamp)
          The time stamp of the data record from which to start reading.  Used
          with  shard  iterator  type  AT_TIMESTAMP.  A time stamp is the Unix
          epoch  date   with   precision   in   milliseconds.   For   example,
          2016-04-04T19:58:46.480-00:00  or  1459799926.480 . If a record with
          this exact time stamp does not exist, the iterator returned  is  for
          the next (later) record. If the time stamp is older than the current
          trim horizon, the iterator returned is for the oldest untrimmed data
          record (TRIM_HORIZON).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To obtain a shard iterator

       The  following  get-shard-iterator  example uses the AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER
       shard iterator type and generates a shard  iterator  to  start  reading
       data  records  exactly  from  the position denoted by the specified se-
       quence number.

          aws kinesis get-shard-iterator \
              --stream-name samplestream \
              --shard-id shardId-000000000001 \
              --shard-iterator-type LATEST

       Output:

          {
              "ShardIterator": "AAAAAAAAAAFEvJjIYI+3jw/4aqgH9FifJ+n48XWTh/IFIsbILP6o5eDueD39NXNBfpZ10WL5K6ADXk8w+5H+Qhd9cFA9k268CPXCz/kebq1TGYI7Vy+lUkA9BuN3xvATxMBGxRY3zYK05gqgvaIRn94O8SqeEqwhigwZxNWxID3Ej7YYYcxQi8Q/fIrCjGAy/n2r5Z9G864YpWDfN9upNNQAR/iiOWKs"
          }

OUTPUT
       ShardIterator -> (string)
          The position in the shard from which to start reading  data  records
          sequentially. A shard iterator specifies this position using the se-
          quence number of a data record in a shard.
