SPLIT-SHARD()                                                    SPLIT-SHARD()



NAME
       split-shard -

DESCRIPTION
       Splits  a  shard into two new shards in the Kinesis data stream, to in-
       crease the stream's capacity to ingest and transport  data.  SplitShard
       is  called  when  there is a need to increase the overall capacity of a
       stream because of an expected increase in the volume  of  data  records
       being ingested.

       You  can also use SplitShard when a shard appears to be approaching its
       maximum utilization; for example, the producers sending data  into  the
       specific  shard  are suddenly sending more than previously anticipated.
       You can also call SplitShard to increase stream capacity, so that  more
       Kinesis Data Streams applications can simultaneously read data from the
       stream for real-time processing.

       You must specify the shard to be split and the new hash key,  which  is
       the  position  in  the shard where the shard gets split in two. In many
       cases, the new hash key might be the average of the beginning and  end-
       ing  hash  key,  but  it  can  be any hash key value in the range being
       mapped into the shard. For more information, see Split a Shard  in  the
       Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide .

       You  can  use  DescribeStreamSummary and the  ListShards APIs to deter-
       mine the shard ID and hash key values for  the  ShardToSplit  and  New-
       StartingHashKey  parameters  that  are  specified in the SplitShard re-
       quest.
          SplitShard is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a SplitShard
          request,  Kinesis  Data  Streams  immediately returns a response and
          sets the stream status to UPDATING . After  the  operation  is  com-
          pleted, Kinesis Data Streams sets the stream status to ACTIVE . Read
          and write operations continue to work while the stream is in the UP-
          DATING state.

       You  can  use  DescribeStreamSummary to check the status of the stream,
       which is returned in StreamStatus . If the  stream  is  in  the  ACTIVE
       state, you can call SplitShard .

       If  the specified stream does not exist,  DescribeStreamSummary returns
       a ResourceNotFoundException . If you try to create more shards than are
       authorized for your account, you receive a LimitExceededException .

       For  the  default  shard  limit for an Amazon Web Services account, see
       Kinesis Data Streams Limits in the Amazon Kinesis Data  Streams  Devel-
       oper  Guide  . To increase this limit, contact Amazon Web Services Sup-
       port .

       If you try to operate on too many streams simultaneously using   Creat-
       eStream  ,   DeleteStream ,  MergeShards , and/or  SplitShard , you re-
       ceive a LimitExceededException .
          SplitShard has a limit of five transactions per second per account.

SYNOPSIS
            split-shard
          --stream-name <value>
          --shard-to-split <value>
          --new-starting-hash-key <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stream-name (string)
          The name of the stream for the shard split.

       --shard-to-split (string)
          The shard ID of the shard to split.

       --new-starting-hash-key (string)
          A hash key value for the starting hash  key  of  one  of  the  child
          shards  created  by  the split. The hash key range for a given shard
          constitutes a set of ordered contiguous positive integers. The value
          for  NewStartingHashKey  must  be  in  the  range of hash keys being
          mapped into the shard. The NewStartingHashKey hash key value and all
          higher  hash  key values in hash key range are distributed to one of
          the child shards. All the lower hash key values  in  the  range  are
          distributed to the other child shard.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To split shards

       The following split-shard example splits the specified shard  into  two
       new shards using a new starting hash key of 10.

          aws kinesis split-shard \
              --stream-name samplestream \
              --shard-to-split shardId-000000000000 \
              --new-starting-hash-key 10

       This command produces no output.

       For  more information, see Splitting a Shard in the Amazon Kinesis Data
       Streams Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None



                                                                 SPLIT-SHARD()
