OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the application. This name is visible to users when dis-
          play name is not specified.

       --display-name (string)

          in the application catalog.

       --description (string)
          The description of the application.

       --icon-s3-location (structure)
          The icon S3 location of the application.

          S3Bucket -> (string)
              The S3 bucket of the S3 object.

          S3Key -> (string)
              The S3 key of the S3 object.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Bucket=string,S3Key=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Bucket": "string",
            "S3Key": "string"
          }

       --launch-path (string)
          The launch path of the application.

       --working-directory (string)
          The working directory of the application.

       --launch-parameters (string)
          The launch parameters of the application.

       --app-block-arn (string)
          The ARN of the app block.

       --attributes-to-delete (list)
          The attributes to delete for an application.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            LAUNCH_PARAMETERS
            WORKING_DIRECTORY

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
