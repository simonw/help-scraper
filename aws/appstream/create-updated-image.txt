SYNOPSIS
            create-updated-image
          --existing-image-name <value>
          --new-image-name <value>
          [--new-image-description <value>]
          [--new-image-display-name <value>]
          [--new-image-tags <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --existing-image-name (string)
          The name of the image to update.

       --new-image-name (string)
          The name of the new image. The name must be unique  within  the  AWS
          account and Region.

       --new-image-description (string)
          The description to display for the new image.

       --new-image-display-name (string)
          The name to display for the new image.

       --new-image-tags (map)
          The tags to associate with the new image. A tag is a key-value pair,
          and the value is optional. For example, Environment=Test. If you  do
          not specify a value, Environment=.

          Generally  allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces rep-
          resentable in UTF-8, and the following special characters:

          _ . : / = + - @

          If you do not specify a value, the value is set to an empty string.

          For more information about tags, see Tagging Your Resources  in  the
          Amazon AppStream 2.0 Administration Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Indicates whether to display the status of image update availability
          before AppStream 2.0 initiates the process of creating a new updated
          image. If this value is set to true , AppStream 2.0 displays whether
          image updates are available. If this value is set to  false  ,  App-
          Stream  2.0  initiates  the  process of creating a new updated image
          without displaying whether image updates are available.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
