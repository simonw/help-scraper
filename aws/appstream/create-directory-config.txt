SYNOPSIS
            create-directory-config
          --directory-name <value>
          --organizational-unit-distinguished-names <value>
          [--service-account-credentials <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-name (string)
          The  fully  qualified name of the directory (for example, corp.exam-
          ple.com).

       --organizational-unit-distinguished-names (list)
          The distinguished names of the organizational units for computer ac-
          counts.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --service-account-credentials (structure)
          The  credentials  for the service account used by the fleet or image
          builder to connect to the directory.

          AccountName -> (string)
              The user name of the account. This account must have the follow-
              ing  privileges:  create computer objects, join computers to the
              domain, and change/reset the password on descendant computer ob-
              jects for the organizational units specified.

          AccountPassword -> (string)
              The password for the account.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AccountName=string,AccountPassword=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AccountName": "string",
            "AccountPassword": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
