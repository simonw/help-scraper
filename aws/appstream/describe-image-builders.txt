DESCRIBE-IMAGE-BUILDERS()                            DESCRIBE-IMAGE-BUILDERS()



NAME
       describe-image-builders -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  list that describes one or more specified image builders,
       if the image builder names are provided. Otherwise, all image  builders
       in the account are described.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-image-builders  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: ImageBuilders

SYNOPSIS
            describe-image-builders
          [--names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --names (list)
          The names of the image builders to describe.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              Platform -> (string)
                 The operating system platform of the image builder.

              IamRoleArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the IAM role that is applied to the image builder.
                 To assume a role, the image builder calls  the  AWS  Security
                 Token  Service  (STS) AssumeRole API operation and passes the
                 ARN of the role to use. The operation creates a  new  session
                 with  temporary credentials. AppStream 2.0 retrieves the tem-
                 porary credentials  and  creates  the  appstream_machine_role
                 credential profile on the instance.

                 For  more information, see Using an IAM Role to Grant Permis-
                 sions to Applications and Scripts Running  on  AppStream  2.0

                     The state change reason message.

              CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time stamp when the image builder was created.
