NAME
       update-fleet -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the specified fleet.

       If  the fleet is in the STOPPED state, you can update any attribute ex-
       cept the fleet name.

       If the fleet is in the RUNNING state,  you  can  update  the  following
       based on the fleet type:

       o Always-On  and On-Demand fleet types You can update the DisplayName ,
         ComputeCapacity , ImageARN , ImageName ,  IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSec-
         onds , and DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds attributes.

       o Elastic  fleet  type You can update the DisplayName , IdleDisconnect-
         TimeoutInSeconds , DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds , MaxConcurrentSessions
         , and UsbDeviceFilterStrings attributes.

       If the fleet is in the STARTING or STOPPED state, you can't update it.

          o stream.standard.medium

       --compute-capacity (structure)
          The desired capacity for the fleet. This is not allowed for  Elastic
          fleets.

          DesiredInstances -> (integer)
              The desired number of streaming instances.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DesiredInstances=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DesiredInstances": integer
          }

       --vpc-config (structure)
          The  VPC  configuration  for the fleet. This is required for Elastic
          fleets, but not required for other fleet types. Elastic  fleets  re-
          quire  that you specify at least two subnets in different availabil-
          ity zones.

          SubnetIds -> (list)
              The identifiers of the subnets to which a network  interface  is
              attached  from  the  fleet  instance  or image builder instance.
              Fleet instances use one or more subnets. Image builder instances
              use one subnet.

              (string)

          SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              The  identifiers  of  the security groups for the fleet or image
              builder.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SubnetIds=string,string,SecurityGroupIds=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SubnetIds": ["string", ...],
            "SecurityGroupIds": ["string", ...]
          }

       --max-user-duration-in-seconds (integer)
          The maximum amount of time that a streaming session can  remain  ac-
          tive,  in  seconds.  If users are still connected to a streaming in-
          stance five minutes before this limit is reached, they are  prompted
          to  save  any  open  documents before being disconnected. After this
          time elapses, the instance is terminated and replaced by a  new  in-
          stance.

          Specify a value between 600 and 360000.

       --disconnect-timeout-in-seconds (integer)
          The  amount  of  time  that a streaming session remains active after
          users disconnect. If users try to reconnect to the streaming session
          after  a  disconnection or network interruption within this time in-
          terval, they are connected to  their  previous  session.  Otherwise,
          they are connected to a new session with a new streaming instance.

          Specify a value between 60 and 360000.

       --delete-vpc-config | --no-delete-vpc-config (boolean)
          Deletes the VPC association for the specified fleet.

       --description (string)
          The description to display.

       --display-name (string)
          The fleet name to display.

       --enable-default-internet-access  | --no-enable-default-internet-access
       (boolean)
          Enables or disables default internet access for the fleet.

       --domain-join-info (structure)
          The name of the directory and organizational unit  (OU)  to  use  to
          join the fleet to a Microsoft Active Directory domain.

          DirectoryName -> (string)
              The fully qualified name of the directory (for example, corp.ex-
              ample.com).

          OrganizationalUnitDistinguishedName -> (string)
              The distinguished name of the organizational unit  for  computer
              accounts.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DirectoryName=string,OrganizationalUnitDistinguishedName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DirectoryName": "string",
            "OrganizationalUnitDistinguishedName": "string"
          }

       --idle-disconnect-timeout-in-seconds (integer)
          The amount of time that users can be idle (inactive) before they are
          disconnected from their streaming session  and  the  DisconnectTime-
          outInSeconds  time  interval  begins. Users are notified before they
          are disconnected due to inactivity. If users try to reconnect to the
          streaming  session before the time interval specified in Disconnect-
          TimeoutInSeconds elapses, they are connected to their previous  ses-
          sion. Users are considered idle when they stop providing keyboard or
          mouse input during their streaming session. File uploads  and  down-
          loads,  audio  in,  audio out, and pixels changing do not qualify as
          user activity. If users continue to be idle after the time  interval
          in IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds elapses, they are disconnected.

          To  prevent users from being disconnected due to inactivity, specify
          a value of 0. Otherwise, specify a value between 60  and  3600.  The
          default value is 0.

          NOTE:
              If  you  enable  this  feature,  we recommend that you specify a
              value that corresponds exactly to a whole number of minutes (for
              example,  60,  120, and 180). If you don't do this, the value is
              rounded to the nearest minute. For example,  if  you  specify  a
              value  of  70, users are disconnected after 1 minute of inactiv-
              ity. If you specify a value that is at the midpoint between  two
              different  minutes, the value is rounded up. For example, if you
              specify a value of 90, users are disconnected after 2 minutes of
              inactivity.

       --attributes-to-delete (list)
          The fleet attributes to delete.

          (string)
              The fleet attribute.

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            VPC_CONFIGURATION
            VPC_CONFIGURATION_SECURITY_GROUP_IDS
            DOMAIN_JOIN_INFO
            IAM_ROLE_ARN
            USB_DEVICE_FILTER_STRINGS

       --iam-role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the IAM role to apply to the
          fleet. To assume a role, a fleet instance calls the AWS Security To-
          ken Service (STS) AssumeRole API operation and passes the ARN of the
          role to use. The operation creates a new session with temporary cre-
          dentials. AppStream 2.0 retrieves the temporary credentials and cre-
          ates the appstream_machine_role credential profile on the instance.

          For more information, see Using an IAM Role to Grant Permissions  to
          Applications  and  Scripts  Running  on  AppStream 2.0 Streaming In-
          stances in the Amazon AppStream 2.0 Administration Guide .

       --stream-view (string)
          The AppStream 2.0 view that is displayed to  your  users  when  they
          stream  from  the  fleet. When APP is specified, only the windows of
          applications opened by users display. When DESKTOP is specified, the
          standard desktop that is provided by the operating system displays.

          The default value is APP .

          Possible values:

          o APP

          o DESKTOP

       --platform (string)
          The platform of the fleet. WINDOWS_SERVER_2019 and AMAZON_LINUX2 are
          supported for Elastic fleets.

          Possible values:

          o WINDOWS

          o WINDOWS_SERVER_2016

          o WINDOWS_SERVER_2019

          o AMAZON_LINUX2

       --max-concurrent-sessions (integer)
          The maximum number of concurrent sessions for a fleet.

       --usb-device-filter-strings (list)
          The USB device filter strings that specify which USB devices a  user
          can  redirect to the fleet streaming session, when using the Windows
          native client. This is allowed but not required for Elastic fleets.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

              before they are disconnected due to inactivity. If users try  to
              reconnect  to  the  streaming  session  before the time interval
              specified in DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds elapses, they  are  con-
              nected to their previous session. Users are considered idle when
              they stop providing keyboard or mouse input during their stream-
              ing  session.  File  uploads and downloads, audio in, audio out,
              and pixels changing do not qualify as user  activity.  If  users
              continue  to  be idle after the time interval in IdleDisconnect-
              TimeoutInSeconds elapses, they are disconnected.

              To prevent users from  being  disconnected  due  to  inactivity,
              specify  a value of 0. Otherwise, specify a value between 60 and
              3600. The default value is 0.

              NOTE:
                 If you enable this feature, we recommend that you  specify  a
                 value  that  corresponds exactly to a whole number of minutes
                 (for example, 60, 120, and 180). If you don't  do  this,  the
                 value  is  rounded to the nearest minute. For example, if you
                 specify a value of 70, users are disconnected after 1  minute
                 of inactivity. If you specify a value that is at the midpoint
                 between two different minutes, the value is rounded  up.  For
                 example, if you specify a value of 90, users are disconnected
                 after 2 minutes of inactivity.

          IamRoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the IAM role that is applied to the fleet. To  assume
              a  role, the fleet instance calls the AWS Security Token Service
              (STS) AssumeRole API operation and passes the ARN of the role to
              use.  The operation creates a new session with temporary creden-
              tials. AppStream 2.0 retrieves  the  temporary  credentials  and
              creates the appstream_machine_role credential profile on the in-
              stance.

              For more information, see Using an IAM Role to Grant Permissions
              to  Applications  and Scripts Running on AppStream 2.0 Streaming
              Instances in the Amazon AppStream 2.0 Administration Guide .

          StreamView -> (string)
              The AppStream 2.0 view that is displayed to your users when they
              stream  from  the fleet. When APP is specified, only the windows
              of applications opened by users display. When DESKTOP is  speci-
              fied,  the  standard  desktop  that is provided by the operating
              system displays.

              The default value is APP .

          Platform -> (string)
              The platform of the fleet.

          MaxConcurrentSessions -> (integer)
              The maximum number of concurrent sessions for the fleet.

          UsbDeviceFilterStrings -> (list)
              The USB device filter strings associated with the fleet.

              (string)
