              Describes  an  interface  VPC endpoint (interface endpoint) that
              lets you create a private connection between the virtual private
              cloud (VPC) that you specify and AppStream 2.0. When you specify
              an interface endpoint for a stack, users of the stack  can  con-
              nect to AppStream 2.0 only through that endpoint. When you spec-
              ify an interface endpoint for an image  builder,  administrators
              can connect to the image builder only through that endpoint.

              EndpointType -> (string)
                 The type of interface endpoint.

              VpceId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  (ID)  of the VPC in which the interface end-
                 point is used.

          ]

       --embed-host-domains (list)
          The domains where AppStream 2.0 streaming sessions can  be  embedded
          in an iframe. You must approve the domains that you want to host em-
          bedded AppStream 2.0 streaming sessions.

          (string)
              Specifies a valid domain that can embed AppStream.  Valid  exam-
              ples   include:  ["testorigin.tt--com",  "testingorigin.com.us",
              "test.com.us"] Invalid examples  include:  ["test,com",  ".com",
              "h*llo.com". ""]

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
