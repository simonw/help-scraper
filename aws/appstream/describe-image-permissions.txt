       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-image-permissions
          --name <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--shared-aws-account-ids <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the private image for which to describe permissions. The
          image must be one that you own.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum size of each page of results.

       --shared-aws-account-ids (list)
          The  12-digit  identifier of one or more AWS accounts with which the
          image is shared.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token to use to retrieve the next page of results for
          this operation. If this value is null, it retrieves the first page.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
