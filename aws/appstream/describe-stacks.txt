DESCRIBE-STACKS()                                            DESCRIBE-STACKS()



NAME
       describe-stacks -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  list  that describes one or more specified stacks, if the
       stack names are provided. Otherwise, all stacks in the account are  de-
       scribed.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-stacks is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Stacks

SYNOPSIS
            describe-stacks
          [--names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --names (list)
          The names of the stacks to describe.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     abled for the first time for an account in an AWS Region,
                     an S3 bucket is created. The bucket is unique to the  AWS
                     account and the Region.

                     Stream 2.0. When you specify an interface endpoint for  a
                     stack,  users  of  the stack can connect to AppStream 2.0
                     only through that endpoint. When you specify an interface
                     endpoint for an image builder, administrators can connect
                     to the image builder only through that endpoint.

                        The type of interface endpoint.

                 bedded in an iframe. You must approve the  domains  that  you
                 want to host embedded AppStream 2.0 streaming sessions.

                 (string)
                     Specifies  a valid domain that can embed AppStream. Valid
                     examples  include:  ["testorigin.tt--com",   "testingori-
                     gin.com.us",  "test.com.us"]  Invalid  examples  include:
                     ["test,com", ".com", "h*llo.com". ""]

       NextToken -> (string)
