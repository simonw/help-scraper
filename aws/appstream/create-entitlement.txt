CREATE-ENTITLEMENT()                                      CREATE-ENTITLEMENT()



NAME
       create-entitlement -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new entitlement. Entitlements control access to specific ap-
       plications within a stack, based on user attributes. Entitlements apply
       to  SAML  2.0 federated user identities. Amazon AppStream 2.0 user pool
       and streaming URL users are entitled to all applications  in  a  stack.
       Entitlements  don't apply to the desktop stream view application, or to
       applications managed by a dynamic app provider using the Dynamic Appli-
       cation Framework.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the entitlement.

       --stack-name (string)
          The name of the stack with which the entitlement is associated.

       --app-visibility (string)
          Specifies whether all or selected apps are entitled.

          Possible values:

          o ALL

          o ASSOCIATED

       --attributes (list)
          The attributes of the entitlement.

          (structure)
              An  attribute  associated with an entitlement. Application enti-
              tlements work by matching a supported SAML 2.0 attribute name to
              a  value  when  a user identity federates to an Amazon AppStream
              2.0 SAML application.

              Name -> (string)
                 A supported AWS  IAM  SAML  PrincipalTag  attribute  that  is
                 matched  to  the associated value when a user identity feder-
                 ates into an Amazon AppStream 2.0 SAML application.

                 The following are valid values:

                 o roles

                 o department

                 o organization

                 o groups

                 o title

                 o costCenter

                 o userType

              Value -> (string)
                 A value that is matched to a supported  SAML  attribute  name
                 when  a  user identity federates into an Amazon AppStream 2.0
                 SAML application.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
