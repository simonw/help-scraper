          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --platform (string)
          The platform of the app block builder.
              WINDOWS_SERVER_2019 is the only valid value.

          Possible values:

          o WINDOWS_SERVER_2019

       --instance-type (string)
          The  instance  type to use when launching the app block builder. The
          following instance types are available:

          o stream.standard.small

          o stream.standard.medium

          o stream.standard.large

          o stream.standard.xlarge

          o stream.standard.2xlarge

       --vpc-config (structure)
          The VPC configuration for the app block builder.

          App block builders require that you specify at least two subnets  in
          different availability zones.

          SubnetIds -> (list)
              The  identifiers  of the subnets to which a network interface is
              attached from the fleet  instance  or  image  builder  instance.
              Fleet instances use one or more subnets. Image builder instances
              use one subnet.

              (string)

          SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              The identifiers of the security groups for the  fleet  or  image
              builder.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SubnetIds=string,string,SecurityGroupIds=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SubnetIds": ["string", ...],
            "SecurityGroupIds": ["string", ...]
          }

       --enable-default-internet-access  | --no-enable-default-internet-access
       (boolean)
          Enables or disables  default  internet  access  for  the  app  block
          builder.

       --iam-role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to apply to the app
          block builder. To assume a role, the app block builder calls the AWS
          Security Token Service (STS) AssumeRole API operation and passes the
          ARN of the role to use. The operation creates  a  new  session  with
          temporary credentials. AppStream 2.0 retrieves the temporary creden-
          tials and creates the appstream_machine_role credential  profile  on
          the instance.

          For  more information, see Using an IAM Role to Grant Permissions to
          Applications and Scripts Running  on  AppStream  2.0  Streaming  In-
          stances in the Amazon AppStream 2.0 Administration Guide .

       --access-endpoints (list)
          The list of interface VPC endpoint (interface endpoint) objects. Ad-
          ministrators can connect to the app block builder only  through  the
          specified endpoints.

          (structure)
              Describes  an  interface  VPC endpoint (interface endpoint) that
              lets you create a private connection between the virtual private
              cloud (VPC) that you specify and AppStream 2.0. When you specify
              an interface endpoint for a stack, users of the stack  can  con-
              nect to AppStream 2.0 only through that endpoint. When you spec-
              ify an interface endpoint for an image  builder,  administrators
              can connect to the image builder only through that endpoint.

              EndpointType -> (string)
                 The type of interface endpoint.

              VpceId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  (ID)  of the VPC in which the interface end-
                 point is used.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EndpointType=string,VpceId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "EndpointType": "STREAMING",
              "VpceId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
