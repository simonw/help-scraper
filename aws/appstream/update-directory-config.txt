OPTIONS
       --directory-name (string)
          The name of the Directory Config object.

       --organizational-unit-distinguished-names (list)
          The distinguished names of the organizational units for computer ac-

       --service-account-credentials (structure)
          The credentials for the service account used by the fleet  or  image
          builder to connect to the directory.

          AccountName -> (string)
              The user name of the account. This account must have the follow-
              ing privileges: create computer objects, join computers  to  the
              domain, and change/reset the password on descendant computer ob-
              jects for the organizational units specified.

          AccountPassword -> (string)
              The password for the account.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AccountName=string,AccountPassword=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AccountName": "string",
            "AccountPassword": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
