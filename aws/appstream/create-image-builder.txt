NAME
       create-image-builder -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an image builder. An image builder is a virtual machine that is
       used to create an image.

       The initial state of the builder is PENDING . When  it  is  ready,  the
       state is RUNNING .

          The VPC configuration for the image builder. You  can  specify  only
          one subnet.

          SubnetIds -> (list)
              The  identifiers  of the subnets to which a network interface is
              attached from the fleet  instance  or  image  builder  instance.
              Fleet instances use one or more subnets. Image builder instances
              use one subnet.

              (string)

          SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              The identifiers of the security groups for the  fleet  or  image

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SubnetIds=string,string,SecurityGroupIds=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SubnetIds": ["string", ...],
            "SecurityGroupIds": ["string", ...]
          }

       --iam-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to apply to the image
          builder. To assume a role, the image builder calls the AWS  Security
          Token  Service  (STS) AssumeRole API operation and passes the ARN of
          the role to use. The operation creates a new session with  temporary
          credentials.  AppStream  2.0 retrieves the temporary credentials and
          creates the appstream_machine_role credential  profile  on  the  in-
          stance.

          For  more information, see Using an IAM Role to Grant Permissions to
          Applications and Scripts Running  on  AppStream  2.0  Streaming  In-

       --appstream-agent-version (string)
          The  version  of  the  AppStream  2.0  agent  to  use for this image

              an interface endpoint for a stack, users of the stack  can  con-
              nect to AppStream 2.0 only through that endpoint. When you spec-
              ify an interface endpoint for an image  builder,  administrators
              can connect to the image builder only through that endpoint.

            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
