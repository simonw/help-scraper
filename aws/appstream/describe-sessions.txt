DESCRIBE-SESSIONS()                                        DESCRIBE-SESSIONS()



NAME
       describe-sessions -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a list that describes the streaming sessions for a specified
       stack and fleet. If a UserId is provided for the stack and fleet,  only
       streaming  sessions  for  that user are described. If an authentication
       type is not provided, the default is  to  authenticate  users  using  a
       streaming URL.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-sessions  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Sessions

SYNOPSIS
            describe-sessions
          --stack-name <value>
          --fleet-name <value>
          [--user-id <value>]
          [--authentication-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The name of the stack. This value is case-sensitive.

       --fleet-name (string)
          The name of the fleet. This value is case-sensitive.

       --user-id (string)
          The user identifier (ID). If you specify a user ID,  you  must  also
          specify the authentication type.

       --authentication-type (string)
          The  authentication method. Specify API for a user authenticated us-
          ing a streaming URL or SAML for a SAML federated user.  The  default
          is to authenticate users using a streaming URL.

          Possible values:

          o API

          o SAML

          o USERPOOL

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Sessions -> (list)
          Information about the streaming sessions.

          (structure)
              Describes a streaming session.

              Id -> (string)
                 The identifier of the streaming session.

              UserId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the user for whom the session was created.

              StackName -> (string)
                 The name of the stack for the streaming session.

              FleetName -> (string)
                 The name of the fleet for the streaming session.

              State -> (string)
                 The current state of the streaming session.

              ConnectionState -> (string)
                 Specifies whether a user is connected to the  streaming  ses-
                 sion.

              StartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time when a streaming instance is dedicated for the user.

              MaxExpirationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  when  the streaming session is set to expire. This
                 time is based on the  MaxUserDurationinSeconds  value,  which
                 determines  the  maximum length of time that a streaming ses-
                 sion can run. A streaming session might end earlier than  the
                 time specified in SessionMaxExpirationTime , when the Discon-
                 nectTimeOutInSeconds elapses or the user chooses to  end  his
                 or her session. If the DisconnectTimeOutInSeconds elapses, or
                 the user chooses to end his or her session, the streaming in-
                 stance is terminated and the streaming session ends.

              AuthenticationType -> (string)
                 The  authentication method. The user is authenticated using a
                 streaming URL (API ) or SAML 2.0 federation (SAML ).

              NetworkAccessConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The network details for the streaming session.

                 EniPrivateIpAddress -> (string)
                     The private IP address of the elastic  network  interface
                     that is attached to instances in your VPC.

                 EniId -> (string)
                     The  resource identifier of the elastic network interface
                     that is attached to instances in your  VPC.  All  network
                     interfaces have the eni-xxxxxxxx resource identifier.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token to use to retrieve the next page of results for
          this operation. If there are no more pages, this value is null.
