NAME
       start-next-pending-job-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets and starts the next pending (status IN_PROGRESS or QUEUED) job ex-
       ecution for a thing.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-next-pending-job-execution
          --thing-name <value>
          [--status-details <value>]
          [--step-timeout-in-minutes <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --thing-name (string)
          The name of the thing associated with the device.

       --status-details (map)
          A collection of name/value pairs that describe the status of the job
          execution. If not specified, the statusDetails are unchanged.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --step-timeout-in-minutes (long)
          Specifies  the amount of time this device has to finish execution of
          this job. If the job execution status is not set to a terminal state
          before  this timer expires, or before the timer is reset (by calling
          UpdateJobExecution , setting the status to IN_PROGRESS and  specify-
          ing a new timeout value in field stepTimeoutInMinutes ) the job exe-
          cution status will be automatically set to  TIMED_OUT  .  Note  that
          setting  this  timeout  has  no effect on that job execution timeout
          which may have been specified when the job  was  created  (CreateJob
          using field timeoutConfig ).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get and start the next pending job execution for a thing

       The following start-next-pending-job-execution  example  retrieves  and
       starts the next job execution whose status is IN_PROGRESS or QUEUED for
       the specified thing.

          aws iot-jobs-data start-next-pending-job-execution \
              --thing-name MotionSensor1
              --endpoint-url https://1234567890abcd.jobs.iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com

       Output:

          {
              "execution": {
                  "approximateSecondsBeforeTimedOut": 88,

OUTPUT
       execution -> (structure)
          A JobExecution object.

          jobId -> (string)
              The  unique identifier you assigned to this job when it was cre-
              ated.

          thingName -> (string)
              The name of the thing that is executing the job.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the  job  execution.  Can  be  one  of:  "QUEUED",
              "IN_PROGRESS",  "FAILED",  "SUCCESS", "CANCELED", "REJECTED", or
              "REMOVED".

          statusDetails -> (map)
              A collection of name/value pairs that describe the status of the
              job execution.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          queuedAt -> (long)
              The  time,  in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job execu-
              tion was enqueued.

          startedAt -> (long)
              The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the  job  execu-
              tion was started.

          lastUpdatedAt -> (long)
              The  time,  in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job execu-
              tion was last updated.

          approximateSecondsBeforeTimedOut -> (long)
              The estimated number of seconds that remain before the job  exe-
              cution status will be changed to TIMED_OUT .

          versionNumber -> (long)
              The version of the job execution. Job execution versions are in-
              cremented each time they are updated by a device.

          executionNumber -> (long)
              A number that identifies a particular job execution on a partic-
              ular device. It can be used later in commands that return or up-
              date job execution information.

          jobDocument -> (string)
              The content of the job document.
