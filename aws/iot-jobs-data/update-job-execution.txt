SYNOPSIS
            update-job-execution
          --job-id <value>
          --thing-name <value>
          --status <value>
          [--status-details <value>]
          [--step-timeout-in-minutes <value>]
          [--expected-version <value>]
          [--include-job-execution-state | --no-include-job-execution-state]
          [--include-job-document | --no-include-job-document]
          [--execution-number <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The unique identifier assigned to this job when it was created.

       --thing-name (string)
          The name of the thing associated with the device.

       --status (string)
          The  new status for the job execution (IN_PROGRESS, FAILED, SUCCESS,
          or REJECTED). This must be specified on every update.

          Possible values:

          o QUEUED

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o SUCCEEDED

          o FAILED

          o TIMED_OUT

          o REJECTED

          o REMOVED

          o CANCELED

       --status-details (map)
          Optional. A collection of name/value pairs that describe the  status
          of  the  job  execution. If not specified, the statusDetails are un-
          changed.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --step-timeout-in-minutes (long)
          Specifies the amount of time this device has to finish execution  of
          this job. If the job execution status is not set to a terminal state
          before this timer expires, or before the timer is  reset  (by  again
          calling  UpdateJobExecution  , setting the status to IN_PROGRESS and
          specifying a new timeout value in this field) the job execution sta-
          tus  will  be  automatically set to TIMED_OUT . Note that setting or
          resetting this timeout has no effect on that job  execution  timeout
          which  may  have  been specified when the job was created (CreateJob
          using field timeoutConfig ).

       --expected-version (long)
          Optional. The expected current version of the  job  execution.  Each
          time  you  update  the job execution, its version is incremented. If
          the version of the job execution stored in Jobs does not match,  the
          update  is  rejected  with  a VersionMismatch error, and an ErrorRe-
          sponse that contains the current job execution status  data  is  re-
          turned.  (This  makes  it  unnecessary  to  perform  a  separate De-
          scribeJobExecution request in order to obtain the job execution sta-
          tus data.)

       --include-job-execution-state | --no-include-job-execution-state (bool-
       ean)
          Optional. When included and set to true, the response  contains  the
          JobExecutionState data. The default is false.

       --include-job-document | --no-include-job-document (boolean)
          Optional.  When set to true, the response contains the job document.
          The default is false.

       --execution-number (long)
          Optional. A number that identifies a particular job execution  on  a
          particular device.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update the status of a job execution

       The  following  update-job-execution  example updates the status of the
       specified job and thing.

          aws iot-jobs-data update-job-execution \
              --job-id SampleJob \
              --thing-name MotionSensor1 \
              --status REMOVED \
              --endpoint-url https://1234567890abcd.jobs.iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com

       Output:

          {
              "executionState": {
                  "status": "REMOVED",
                  "versionNumber": 3
              },
          }

       For more information, see Devices and Jobs in  the  AWS  IoT  Developer
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       executionState -> (structure)
          A JobExecutionState object.

          status -> (string)
              The  status  of  the  job  execution.  Can  be one of: "QUEUED",
              "IN_PROGRESS", "FAILED", "SUCCESS", "CANCELED",  "REJECTED",  or
              "REMOVED".

          statusDetails -> (map)
              A collection of name/value pairs that describe the status of the

              value -> (string)

          versionNumber -> (long)
              The version of the job execution. Job execution versions are in-
              cremented each time they are updated by a device.
