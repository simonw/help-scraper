DESCRIBE-DELIVERY-STREAM()                          DESCRIBE-DELIVERY-STREAM()



NAME
       describe-delivery-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  specified  delivery stream and its status. For example,
       after your delivery stream is created, call  DescribeDeliveryStream  to
       see  whether the delivery stream is ACTIVE and therefore ready for data
       to be sent to it.

       If the status of a delivery stream is  CREATING_FAILED  ,  this  status
       doesn't change, and you can't invoke  CreateDeliveryStream again on it.
       However, you can invoke the  DeleteDeliveryStream operation  to  delete
       it. If the status is DELETING_FAILED , you can force deletion by invok-
       ing  DeleteDeliveryStream again but with  DeleteDeliveryStreamInput$Al-
       lowForceDelete set to true.

OPTIONS
       --delivery-stream-name (string)
          The name of the delivery stream.

       --limit (integer)
          The  limit on the number of destinations to return. You can have one
          destination per delivery stream.

       --exclusive-start-destination-id (string)
          The ID of the destination to start returning the destination  infor-
          mation.  Kinesis Data Firehose supports one destination per delivery
          stream.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

                data stream as a source.

          VersionId -> (string)
              Each  time the destination is updated for a delivery stream, the
              version ID is changed, and the current version  ID  is  required
              when updating the destination. This is so that the service knows
              it is applying the changes to the correct version of the  deliv-
              ery stream.

                               the destination. The default value is 300. This
                               parameter  is  optional  but  if  you specify a
                               value for it, you must also specify a value for
                               SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

                        CompressionFormat -> (string)

                                      place  them  with  underscores.  This is
                                      useful because Apache Hive does not  al-
                                      low  dots  in column names. For example,
                                      if the JSON contains a key whose name is
                                      "a.b", you can define the column name to
                                      be "a_b" when using this option.

                                      The default is false .

                                   CaseInsensitive -> (boolean)
                                      When set to true , which is the default,
                                      Kinesis Data Firehose converts JSON keys
                                      to lowercase before deserializing them.

                                   ColumnToJsonKeyMappings -> (map)
                                      Maps column  names  to  JSON  keys  that
                                      aren't  identical  to  the column names.
                                      This is useful when  the  JSON  contains
                                      keys  that  are Hive keywords. For exam-
                                      ple, timestamp is a Hive keyword. If you
                                      have  a  JSON  key named timestamp , set
                                      this parameter to {"ts": "timestamp"} to
                                      map this key to a column named ts .

                                      key -> (string)

                               HiveJsonSerDe -> (structure)
                                   The  native Hive / HCatalog JsonSerDe. Used
                                   by Kinesis Data Firehose for  deserializing
                                   data,  which  means  converting it from the
                                   JSON format in preparation for  serializing
                                   it  to  the  Parquet or ORC format. This is
                                   one of two deserializers  you  can  choose,
                                   depending on which one offers the function-
                                   ality you need. The  other  option  is  the
                                   OpenX SerDe.

                                   TimestampFormats -> (list)
                                      Indicates  how  you  want  Kinesis  Data
                                      Firehose to parse  the  date  and  time-
                                      stamps that may be present in your input
                                      data  JSON.  To  specify  these   format
                                      strings,  follow  the  pattern syntax of
                                      JodaTime's     DateTimeFormat     format
                                      strings. For more information, see Class
                                      DateTimeFormat . You can  also  use  the
                                      special value millis to parse timestamps
                                      in  epoch  milliseconds.  If  you  don't
                                      specify  a format, Kinesis Data Firehose
                                      uses java.sql.Timestamp::valueOf by  de-
                                      fault.

                                      (string)

                        OutputFormatConfiguration -> (structure)
                            Specifies  the  serializer  that  you want Kinesis
                            Data Firehose to use to convert the format of your
                            data  to the Parquet or ORC format. This parameter
                            is required if Enabled is set to true.

                            Serializer -> (structure)
                               Specifies which  serializer  to  use.  You  can
                               choose  either  the  ORC  SerDe  or the Parquet
                               SerDe. If both are non-null, the server rejects
                               the request.

                               ParquetSerDe -> (structure)
                                   A  serializer to use for converting data to
                                   the Parquet format  before  storing  it  in
                                   Amazon S3. For more information, see Apache

                                      The  Hadoop  Distributed   File   System
                                      (HDFS) block size. This is useful if you
                                      intend to copy the data from  Amazon  S3
                                      to  HDFS before querying. The default is
                                      256 MiB and the minimum is 64 MiB. Kine-
                                      sis  Data  Firehose  uses this value for
                                      padding calculations.

                                   PageSizeBytes -> (integer)
                                      The Parquet page size. Column chunks are
                                      divided  into pages. A page is conceptu-
                                      ally an indivisible unit  (in  terms  of
                                      compression  and  encoding). The minimum
                                      value is 64 KiB and  the  default  is  1
                                      MiB.

                                   Compression -> (string)
                                      The  compression  code  to use over data
                                      blocks. The possible values  are  UNCOM-
                                      PRESSED  ,  SNAPPY , and GZIP , with the
                                      default being SNAPPY .  Use  SNAPPY  for
                                      higher  decompression speed. Use GZIP if
                                      the compression ratio is more  important
                                      than speed.

                                   EnableDictionaryCompression -> (boolean)
                                      Indicates  whether  to enable dictionary
                                      compression.

                                   MaxPaddingBytes -> (integer)
                                      The maximum amount of padding to  apply.
                                      This is useful if you intend to copy the

                                   RowIndexStride -> (integer)
                                      The  number  of  rows  between index en-
                                      tries. The default  is  10,000  and  the

                                   EnablePadding -> (boolean)
                                      Set  this  to  true to indicate that you
                                      want stripes to be padded  to  the  HDFS
                                      block  boundaries. This is useful if you
                                      intend to copy the data from  Amazon  S3
                                      to  HDFS before querying. The default is

                                   PaddingTolerance -> (double)
                                      A number between 0 and  1  that  defines
                                      the  tolerance  for  block  padding as a
                                      decimal fraction of stripe size. The de-
                                      fault  value is 0.05, which means 5 per-
                                      cent of stripe size.

                                      For the default values  of  64  MiB  ORC
                                      stripes and 256 MiB HDFS blocks, the de-
                                      fault block padding tolerance of 5  per-
                                      cent  reserves  a maximum of 3.2 MiB for
                                      padding within the  256  MiB  block.  In
                                      such  a  case,  if  the  available  size
                                      within the block is more than 3.2 MiB, a
                                      new,  smaller  stripe is inserted to fit
                                      within that space. This ensures that  no
                                      stripe   crosses  block  boundaries  and
                                      causes remote reads within a  node-local
                                      task.

                                      Represents  the  fraction  of  the total
                                      number of non-null  rows.  To  turn  off
                                      dictionary  encoding,  set this fraction
                                      to a number that is less than the number

                            documents are written to Amazon S3. Default  value
                            is  300  seconds  (5 minutes). A value of 0 (zero)
                            results in no retries.

                               The  default  value is 5. This parameter is op-
                               tional but if you specify a value for  it,  you
                               must also specify a value for IntervalInSeconds
                               , and vice versa.

                               We recommend setting this parameter to a  value
                               greater  than  the amount of data you typically
                               ingest into the delivery stream in 10  seconds.
                               For  example, if you typically ingest data at 1
                               MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or higher.

                            IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)

                               parameter  is  optional  but  if  you specify a
                               value for it, you must also specify a value for
                               SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

                        CompressionFormat -> (string)

                            The number of ENIs that Kinesis Data Firehose cre-
                            ates  in  the subnets specified here scales up and
                            down automatically based on throughput. To  enable
                            Kinesis  Data  Firehose  to scale up the number of
                            ENIs to match throughput,  ensure  that  you  have
                            sufficient  quota. To help you calculate the quota
                            you need, assume that Kinesis  Data  Firehose  can
                            create  up  to three ENIs for this delivery stream
                            for each of the subnets specified here.  For  more
                            information  about  ENI  quota, see Network Inter-
                            faces in the Amazon VPC Quotas topic.

                            (string)

                        RoleARN -> (string)
                            The ARN of the IAM role that the  delivery  stream
                            uses  to  create endpoints in the destination VPC.
                            You can use your existing  Kinesis  Data  Firehose
                            delivery  role  or  you can specify a new role. In
                            either case, make sure that the  role  trusts  the
                            Kinesis  Data  Firehose service principal and that
                            it grants the following permissions:

                            o ec2:DescribeVpcs

                            o ec2:DescribeVpcAttribute

                            o ec2:DescribeSubnets

                            o ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups

                            o ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces

                            o ec2:CreateNetworkInterface

                            o ec2:CreateNetworkInterfacePermission

                            o ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface

                            If you revoke these permissions after  you  create
                            the  delivery  stream, Kinesis Data Firehose can't
                            scale out by creating more  ENIs  when  necessary.
                            You  might  therefore see a degradation in perfor-
                            mance.

                        SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                            The IDs of the security groups that  Kinesis  Data
                            Firehose  uses  when it creates ENIs in the VPC of
                            the Amazon ES destination. You can  use  the  same
                            security  group  that the Amazon ES domain uses or
                            different ones. If you specify different  security
                            groups,  ensure  that  they  allow  outbound HTTPS
                            traffic to the Amazon ES domain's security  group.
                            Also  ensure  that the Amazon ES domain's security
                            group  allows  HTTPS  traffic  from  the  security
                            groups  specified  here. If you use the same secu-
                            rity group for both your delivery stream  and  the
                            Amazon ES domain, make sure the security group in-
                            bound rule allows HTTPS traffic. For more informa-
                            tion  about  security  group  rules,  see Security
                            group rules in the Amazon VPC documentation.

                     S3DestinationDescription -> (structure)
                        Describes a destination in Amazon S3.

                        RoleARN -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS  creden-
                            tials.  For  more information, see Amazon Resource
                            Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces .

                        BucketARN -> (string)
                            The ARN of the S3 bucket.  For  more  information,
                            see  Amazon  Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service
                            Namespaces .

                        Prefix -> (string)
                            The "YYYY/MM/DD/HH" time format prefix is automat-
                            ically used for delivered Amazon S3 files. You can
                            also specify a  custom  prefix,  as  described  in
                            Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects .

                        ErrorOutputPrefix -> (string)
                            A  prefix that Kinesis Data Firehose evaluates and
                            adds to failed records before writing them to  S3.
                            This  prefix  appears  immediately  following  the
                            bucket name. For information about how to  specify
                            this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Ob-
                            jects .

                        BufferingHints -> (structure)
                            The buffering option. If no  value  is  specified,
                            BufferingHints object default values are used.

                            SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                               Buffer  incoming data to the specified size, in
                               MiBs, before delivering it to the  destination.
                               The  default  value is 5. This parameter is op-
                               tional but if you specify a value for  it,  you
                               must also specify a value for IntervalInSeconds
                               , and vice versa.

                               We recommend setting this parameter to a  value
                               greater  than  the amount of data you typically
                               ingest into the delivery stream in 10  seconds.
                               For  example, if you typically ingest data at 1
                               MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or higher.

                            IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                               Buffer incoming data for the  specified  period
                               of  time,  in  seconds, before delivering it to
                               the destination. The default value is 300. This
                               parameter  is  optional  but  if  you specify a
                               value for it, you must also specify a value for
                               SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

                        CompressionFormat -> (string)
                            The  compression format. If no value is specified,
                            the default is UNCOMPRESSED .

                        EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The encryption configuration. If no value is spec-
                            ified, the default is no encryption.

                            NoEncryptionConfig -> (string)
                               Specifically  override  existing encryption in-
                               formation to ensure that no encryption is used.

                            KMSEncryptionConfig -> (structure)
                               The encryption key.

                               AWSKMSKeyARN -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  en-
                                   cryption  key.  Must belong to the same AWS
                                   Region as the destination Amazon S3 bucket.

                                   Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces .

                        CloudWatchLoggingOptions -> (structure)
                            The Amazon CloudWatch logging options for your de-
                            livery stream.

                            Enabled -> (boolean)
                               Enables or disables CloudWatch logging.

                               The  CloudWatch  group  name  for logging. This
                               value is required if CloudWatch logging is  en-
                               abled.

                            LogStreamName -> (string)

                     CloudWatchLoggingOptions -> (structure)
                        Describes  the  Amazon  CloudWatch logging options for
                        your delivery stream.

                        Enabled -> (boolean)
                            Enables or disables CloudWatch logging.

                            The  CloudWatch  log stream name for logging. This
                            value is required if  CloudWatch  logging  is  en-
                            abled.

                     VpcConfigurationDescription -> (structure)

                        SubnetIds -> (list)
                            The  IDs of the subnets that Kinesis Data Firehose
                            uses to create ENIs in the VPC of  the  Amazon  ES
                            destination. Make sure that the routing tables and
                            inbound and outbound rules allow traffic  to  flow
                            from  the  subnets whose IDs are specified here to
                            the subnets that have the  destination  Amazon  ES
                            endpoints.  Kinesis Data Firehose creates at least
                            one ENI in each of the subnets that are  specified
                            here. Do not delete or modify these ENIs.

                            The number of ENIs that Kinesis Data Firehose cre-
                            ates in the subnets specified here scales  up  and
                            down  automatically based on throughput. To enable
                            Kinesis Data Firehose to scale up  the  number  of
                            ENIs  to  match  throughput,  ensure that you have
                            sufficient quota. To help you calculate the  quota
                            you  need,  assume  that Kinesis Data Firehose can
                            create up to three ENIs for this  delivery  stream
                            for  each  of the subnets specified here. For more
                            information about ENI quota,  see  Network  Inter-
                            faces in the Amazon VPC Quotas topic.

                            (string)

                        RoleARN -> (string)
                            The  ARN  of the IAM role that the delivery stream
                            uses to create endpoints in the  destination  VPC.
                            You  can  use  your existing Kinesis Data Firehose
                            delivery role or you can specify a  new  role.  In
                            either  case,  make  sure that the role trusts the
                            Kinesis Data Firehose service principal  and  that
                            it grants the following permissions:

                            o ec2:DescribeVpcs

                            o ec2:DescribeVpcAttribute

                            o ec2:DescribeSubnets

                            o ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups

                            o ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces

                            o ec2:CreateNetworkInterface

                            o ec2:CreateNetworkInterfacePermission

                            o ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface

                            If  you  revoke these permissions after you create
                            the delivery stream, Kinesis Data  Firehose  can't
                            scale  out  by  creating more ENIs when necessary.
                            You might therefore see a degradation  in  perfor-
                            mance.

                        SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                            The  IDs  of the security groups that Kinesis Data
                            Firehose uses when it creates ENIs in the  VPC  of
                            the  Amazon  ES  destination. You can use the same
                            security group that the Amazon ES domain  uses  or
                            different  ones. If you specify different security
                            groups, ensure  that  they  allow  outbound  HTTPS
                            traffic  to the Amazon ES domain's security group.
                            Also ensure that the Amazon ES  domain's  security
                            group  allows  HTTPS  traffic  from  the  security
                            groups specified here. If you use the  same  secu-
                            rity  group  for both your delivery stream and the
                            Amazon ES domain, make sure the security group in-
                            bound rule allows HTTPS traffic. For more informa-
                            tion about  security  group  rules,  see  Security
                            group rules in the Amazon VPC documentation.

                        receive an acknowledgment from Splunk after  it  sends
                        it  data.  At  the  end of the timeout period, Kinesis
                        Data Firehose either tries to send the data  again  or
                        considers it an error, based on your retry settings.

                            the  initial attempt to send data to Splunk fails.
                            It doesn't include the periods during which  Kine-
                            sis  Data  Firehose  waits for acknowledgment from
                            Splunk after each attempt.

                        Defines how documents should be  delivered  to  Amazon
                        S3.  When  set  to  FailedDocumentsOnly , Kinesis Data
                        Firehose writes any data that could not be indexed  to
                        the configured Amazon S3 destination. When set to All-
                        Documents , Kinesis Data Firehose delivers all  incom-
                        ing records to Amazon S3, and also writes failed docu-

                               tional  but  if you specify a value for it, you
                               must also specify a value for IntervalInSeconds
                               , and vice versa.

                               greater than the amount of data  you  typically
                               ingest  into the delivery stream in 10 seconds.
                               For example, if you typically ingest data at  1
                               MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or higher.

                            IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)

                               the destination. The default value is 300. This
                               parameter is optional  but  if  you  specify  a
                               value for it, you must also specify a value for
                               SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

                        CompressionFormat -> (string)
                            The compression format. If no value is  specified,

                               Buffer  incoming data to the specified size, in
                               MiBs, before delivering it to the  destination.
                               The  default  value is 5. This parameter is op-
                               tional but if you specify a value for  it,  you
                               must also specify a value for IntervalInSeconds

                               We recommend setting this parameter to a  value
                               greater  than  the amount of data you typically
                               ingest into the delivery stream in 10  seconds.
                               For  example, if you typically ingest data at 1
                               MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or higher.

                            IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)

                               the destination. The default value is 300. This
                               parameter  is  optional  but  if  you specify a
                               value for it, you must also specify a value for
                               SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

                        CompressionFormat -> (string)
