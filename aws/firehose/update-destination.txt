UPDATE-DESTINATION()                                      UPDATE-DESTINATION()



NAME
       update-destination -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the specified destination of the specified Firehose stream.

       Use  this operation to change the destination type (for example, to re-
       place the Amazon S3 destination with Amazon Redshift) or change the pa-
       rameters  associated  with  a  destination  (for example, to change the
       bucket name of the Amazon S3 destination). The update might  not  occur
       immediately.  The  target Firehose stream remains active while the con-
       figurations are updated, so data writes to the Firehose stream can con-
       tinue  during  this process. The updated configurations are usually ef-
       fective within a few minutes.

       Switching between Amazon OpenSearch Service and other services  is  not
       supported.  For  an Amazon OpenSearch Service destination, you can only
       update to another Amazon OpenSearch Service destination.

       If the destination type is the same, Firehose merges the  configuration
       parameters  specified  with  the destination configuration that already
       exists on the delivery stream. If any of the parameters are not  speci-
       fied in the call, the existing values are retained. For example, in the
       Amazon S3 destination, if  EncryptionConfiguration  is  not  specified,
       then the existing EncryptionConfiguration is maintained on the destina-
       tion.

       If the destination type is not the same, for example, changing the des-
       tination from Amazon S3 to Amazon Redshift, Firehose does not merge any
       parameters. In this case, all parameters must be specified.

       Firehose uses CurrentDeliveryStreamVersionId to avoid  race  conditions
       and  conflicting  merges. This is a required field, and the service up-
       dates the configuration only if the existing configuration has  a  ver-
       sion  ID  that  matches.  After the update is applied successfully, the
       version ID is updated, and can be retrieved  using   DescribeDeliveryS-
       tream . Use the new version ID to set CurrentDeliveryStreamVersionId in
       the next call.

OPTIONS
       --delivery-stream-name (string)
          The name of the Firehose stream.

       --current-delivery-stream-version-id (string)
          Obtain this value from the VersionId  result  of   DeliveryStreamDe-
          scription  .  This  value is required, and helps the service perform
          conditional operations. For example, if there is an interleaving up-
          date  and this value is null, then the update destination fails. Af-
          ter the update is successful, the VersionId value  is  updated.  The
          service  then performs a merge of the old configuration with the new
          configuration.

       --destination-id (string)
          The ID of the destination.

       --s3-destination-update (structure)
          [Deprecated] Describes an update for a destination in Amazon S3.

          RoleARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web  Services  cre-
              dentials. For more information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)
              and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces .

          BucketARN -> (string)
              The ARN of the S3 bucket. For more information, see  Amazon  Re-
              source Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces .

          Prefix -> (string)
              The "YYYY/MM/DD/HH" time format prefix is automatically used for
              delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a custom prefix,
              as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects .

          ErrorOutputPrefix -> (string)
              A  prefix that Firehose evaluates and adds to failed records be-
              fore writing them to S3. This prefix appears immediately follow-
              ing  the  bucket name. For information about how to specify this
              prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects .

          BufferingHints -> (structure)
              The buffering option. If no value is  specified,  BufferingHints
              object default values are used.

              SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                 Buffer  incoming  data to the specified size, in MiBs, before
                 delivering it to the destination. The  default  value  is  5.
                 This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it,
                 you must also specify a value  for  IntervalInSeconds  ,  and
                 vice versa.

                 We  recommend  setting this parameter to a value greater than
                 the amount of data you typically  ingest  into  the  Firehose
                 stream  in  10  seconds. For example, if you typically ingest
                 data at 1 MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or higher.

              IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                 Buffer incoming data for the specified  period  of  time,  in

              Amazon Redshift destinations because they are not  supported  by
              the  Amazon  Redshift  COPY  operation  that  reads  from the S3
              bucket.

          EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
              The encryption configuration. If no value is specified, the  de-

                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the encryption  key.
                        Must  belong to the same Amazon Web Services Region as
                        the destination Amazon S3 bucket.  For  more  informa-
                        tion,  see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web
                        Services Service Namespaces .

                 LogGroupName -> (string)
                     The CloudWatch group name for logging. This value is  re-
                     quired if CloudWatch logging is enabled.

                 LogStreamName -> (string)
                     The CloudWatch log stream name for logging. This value is
                     required if CloudWatch logging is enabled.

          DataFormatConversionConfiguration -> (structure)
              The serializer, deserializer, and  schema  for  converting  data
              from the JSON format to the Parquet or ORC format before writing
              it to Amazon S3.

              SchemaConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Specifies the Amazon Web Services  Glue  Data  Catalog  table
                 that  contains  the column information. This parameter is re-
                 quired if Enabled is set to true.

                 RoleARN -> (string)
                     The role that Firehose can use to access Amazon Web  Ser-
                     vices Glue. This role must be in the same account you use
                     for Firehose. Cross-account roles aren't allowed.

                     WARNING:
                        If the SchemaConfiguration request parameter  is  used
                        as part of invoking the CreateDeliveryStream API, then
                        the RoleARN property is required and its value must be
                        specified.

                 CatalogId -> (string)
                     The  ID  of the Amazon Web Services Glue Data Catalog. If
                     you don't supply this, the Amazon Web Services account ID
                     is used by default.

                 DatabaseName -> (string)
                     Specifies  the name of the Amazon Web Services Glue data-
                     base that contains the schema for the output data.

                     WARNING:
                        If the SchemaConfiguration request parameter  is  used
                        as part of invoking the CreateDeliveryStream API, then
                        the DatabaseName property is required  and  its  value
                        must be specified.

                 TableName -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  Amazon  Web Services Glue table that con-
                     tains the column information that constitutes  your  data
                     schema.

                     WARNING:
                        If  the  SchemaConfiguration request parameter is used
                        as part of invoking the CreateDeliveryStream API, then
                        the  TableName property is required and its value must
                        be specified.

                 Region -> (string)
                     If you don't specify an Amazon Web Services  Region,  the
                     default is the current Region.

                 VersionId -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  table version for the output data schema.
                     If you don't specify this version ID, or if you set it to
                     LATEST  ,  Firehose  uses  the  most recent version. This
                     means that any updates to  the  table  are  automatically
                     picked up.

              InputFormatConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the  deserializer that you want Firehose to use to
                 convert the format of your data from JSON. This parameter  is
                 required if Enabled is set to true.

                 Deserializer -> (structure)
                     Specifies  which  deserializer to use. You can choose ei-
                     ther the Apache Hive JSON SerDe or the OpenX JSON  SerDe.
                     If both are non-null, the server rejects the request.

                     OpenXJsonSerDe -> (structure)
                        The  OpenX  SerDe.  Used by Firehose for deserializing
                        data, which means converting it from the  JSON  format
                        in  preparation  for  serializing it to the Parquet or
                        ORC format. This is one of two deserializers  you  can
                        choose,  depending on which one offers the functional-
                        ity you need. The other option is the  native  Hive  /
                        HCatalog JsonSerDe.

                        ConvertDotsInJsonKeysToUnderscores -> (boolean)
                            When set to true , specifies that the names of the
                            keys include dots and that you  want  Firehose  to
                            replace  them with underscores. This is useful be-
                            cause Apache Hive does not allow  dots  in  column
                            names.  For  example,  if  the JSON contains a key
                            whose name is "a.b", you  can  define  the  column
                            name to be "a_b" when using this option.

                            The default is false .

                        CaseInsensitive -> (boolean)
                            When  set to true , which is the default, Firehose
                            converts JSON keys to lowercase before deserializ-
                            ing them.

                        ColumnToJsonKeyMappings -> (map)
                            Maps column names to JSON keys that aren't identi-
                            cal to the column names. This is useful  when  the
                            JSON contains keys that are Hive keywords. For ex-
                            ample, timestamp is a Hive keyword. If you have  a
                            JSON  key  named timestamp , set this parameter to
                            {"ts": "timestamp"} to map this key  to  a  column
                            named ts .

                            key -> (string)

                            value -> (string)

                     HiveJsonSerDe -> (structure)
                        The native Hive / HCatalog JsonSerDe. Used by Firehose
                        for deserializing data, which means converting it from
                        the  JSON  format in preparation for serializing it to
                        the Parquet or ORC format. This is one of two  deseri-
                        alizers  you can choose, depending on which one offers
                        the functionality you need. The other  option  is  the
                        OpenX SerDe.

                        TimestampFormats -> (list)
                            Indicates  how you want Firehose to parse the date
                            and timestamps that may be present in  your  input
                            data JSON. To specify these format strings, follow
                            the pattern syntax  of  JodaTime's  DateTimeFormat
                            format  strings.  For  more information, see Class
                            DateTimeFormat . You  can  also  use  the  special
                            value  millis  to  parse  timestamps in epoch mil-
                            liseconds. If you don't specify a format, Firehose
                            uses java.sql.Timestamp::valueOf by default.

                            (string)

              OutputFormatConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the  serializer  that  you want Firehose to use to
                 convert the format of your data to the Parquet or ORC format.
                 This parameter is required if Enabled is set to true.

                 Serializer -> (structure)
                     Specifies  which serializer to use. You can choose either
                     the ORC SerDe or the Parquet SerDe. If both are non-null,
                     the server rejects the request.

                     ParquetSerDe -> (structure)
                        A serializer to use for converting data to the Parquet
                        format before storing it in Amazon S3. For more infor-
                        mation, see Apache Parquet .

                        BlockSizeBytes -> (integer)
                            The  Hadoop  Distributed  File System (HDFS) block
                            size. This is useful if you  intend  to  copy  the
                            data  from  Amazon S3 to HDFS before querying. The
                            default is 256 MiB and  the  minimum  is  64  MiB.
                            Firehose uses this value for padding calculations.

                        PageSizeBytes -> (integer)
                            The  Parquet  page size. Column chunks are divided
                            into pages. A page is conceptually an  indivisible
                            unit  (in  terms of compression and encoding). The
                            minimum value is 64 KiB and the default is 1 MiB.

                        Compression -> (string)
                            The compression code to use over data blocks.  The
                            possible  values  are  UNCOMPRESSED , SNAPPY , and
                            GZIP , with the default being SNAPPY . Use  SNAPPY
                            for  higher  decompression  speed. Use GZIP if the
                            compression ratio is more important than speed.

                        EnableDictionaryCompression -> (boolean)
                            Indicates whether to  enable  dictionary  compres-
                            sion.

                        MaxPaddingBytes -> (integer)
                            The  maximum  amount  of padding to apply. This is
                            useful if you intend to copy the data from  Amazon
                            S3 to HDFS before querying. The default is 0.

                        WriterVersion -> (string)
                            Indicates the version of row format to output. The
                            possible values are V1 and V2 . The default is  V1
                            .

                     OrcSerDe -> (structure)
                        A  serializer  to  use  for converting data to the ORC
                        format before storing it in Amazon S3. For more infor-
                        mation, see Apache ORC .

                        StripeSizeBytes -> (integer)
                            The number of bytes in each stripe. The default is
                            64 MiB and the minimum is 8 MiB.

                        BlockSizeBytes -> (integer)
                            The Hadoop Distributed File  System  (HDFS)  block
                            size.  This  is  useful  if you intend to copy the
                            data from Amazon S3 to HDFS before  querying.  The
                            default  is  256  MiB  and  the minimum is 64 MiB.
                            Firehose uses this value for padding calculations.

                        RowIndexStride -> (integer)
                            The number of rows between index entries. The  de-
                            fault is 10,000 and the minimum is 1,000.

                        EnablePadding -> (boolean)
                            Set this to true to indicate that you want stripes
                            to be padded to the HDFS block boundaries. This is
                            useful  if you intend to copy the data from Amazon
                            S3 to HDFS before querying. The default is false .

                        PaddingTolerance -> (double)
                            A number between 0 and 1 that defines  the  toler-
                            ance  for  block  padding as a decimal fraction of
                            stripe size. The  default  value  is  0.05,  which
                            means 5 percent of stripe size.

                            For  the  default values of 64 MiB ORC stripes and
                            256 MiB HDFS blocks,  the  default  block  padding
                            tolerance  of  5 percent reserves a maximum of 3.2
                            MiB for padding within the 256 MiB block. In  such
                            a  case, if the available size within the block is
                            more than 3.2 MiB, a new, smaller  stripe  is  in-
                            serted to fit within that space. This ensures that
                            no stripe crosses block boundaries and causes  re-
                            mote reads within a node-local task.

                            Firehose ignores this parameter when  OrcSerDe$En-
                            ablePadding is false .

                        Compression -> (string)
                            The compression code to use over data blocks.  The
                            default is SNAPPY .

                        BloomFilterColumns -> (list)
                            The  column  names  for which you want Firehose to
                            create bloom filters. The default is null .

                            (string)

                        BloomFilterFalsePositiveProbability -> (double)
                            The Bloom filter false positive probability (FPP).
                            The  lower  the  FPP, the bigger the Bloom filter.
                            The default value is 0.05, the minimum is  0,  and
                            the maximum is 1.

                        DictionaryKeyThreshold -> (double)
                            Represents  the  fraction  of  the total number of
                            non-null rows. To turn  off  dictionary  encoding,
                            set  this  fraction  to a number that is less than
                            the number of distinct keys in  a  dictionary.  To
                            always use dictionary encoding, set this threshold
                            to 1.

                        FormatVersion -> (string)
                            The version of the file  to  write.  The  possible
                            values  are V0_11 and V0_12 . The default is V0_12
                            .

              Enabled -> (boolean)

                     The  period  of time during which Firehose retries to de-
                     liver data to the specified destination.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Specifies that the dynamic partitioning is enabled  for  this
                 Firehose Firehose stream.

          FileExtension -> (string)
              Specify  a file extension. It will override the default file ex-
              tension

                 Optional parameters to use with the Amazon Redshift COPY com-
                 mand. For more information,  see  the  "Optional  Parameters"
                 section of Amazon Redshift COPY command . Some possible exam-
                 ples that would apply to Firehose are as follows:
                     delimiter '\t' lzop; - fields are delimited with "t" (TAB
                     character) and compressed using lzop.

                     delimiter  '|'  -  fields are delimited with "|" (this is
                     the default delimiter).

                     delimiter '|' escape - the delimiter should be escaped.

                     fixedwidth   'venueid:3,venuename:25,venuecity:12,venues-
                     tate:2,venueseats:6'  -  fields  are  fixed  width in the
                     source, with each width specified after every  column  in
                     the table.

                     JSON 's3://mybucket/jsonpaths.txt' - data is in JSON for-
                     mat, and the path specified is the format of the data.

              ments to Amazon Redshift. Default value is 3600 (60 minutes).

              DurationInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The length of time during which Firehose retries delivery af-
                 ter  a failure, starting from the initial request and includ-
                 ing the first attempt. The default value is 3600 seconds  (60
                 minutes). Firehose does not retry if the value of DurationIn-
                 Seconds is 0 (zero) or if the first  delivery  attempt  takes
                 longer than the current value.

          S3Update -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 destination.

              The  compression  formats  SNAPPY  or ZIP cannot be specified in
              RedshiftDestinationUpdate.S3Update because the  Amazon  Redshift
              COPY  operation  that  reads  from the S3 bucket doesn't support
              these compression formats.

              RoleARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  Amazon  Web  Services
                 credentials.  For more information, see Amazon Resource Names
                 (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces .

              BucketARN -> (string)
                 The ARN of the S3 bucket. For more  information,  see  Amazon
                 Resource  Names  (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Name-
                 spaces .

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The "YYYY/MM/DD/HH" time format prefix is automatically  used
                 for  delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a custom
                 prefix, as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects
                 .

              ErrorOutputPrefix -> (string)
                 A  prefix  that Firehose evaluates and adds to failed records
                 before writing them to S3. This  prefix  appears  immediately
                 following the bucket name. For information about how to spec-
                 ify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects .

              BufferingHints -> (structure)
                 The buffering option. If no value is  specified,  BufferingH-
                 ints object default values are used.

                 SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                     Buffer  incoming data to the specified size, in MiBs, be-
                     fore delivering it to the destination. The default  value
                     is  5.  This  parameter  is optional but if you specify a
                     value for it, you must also specify a  value  for  Inter-
                     valInSeconds , and vice versa.

                     We  recommend  setting  this parameter to a value greater
                     than the amount of data you  typically  ingest  into  the
                     Firehose  stream in 10 seconds. For example, if you typi-
                     cally ingest data at 1 MiB/sec, the value  should  be  10
                     MiB or higher.

                 IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                     Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in
                     seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The de-
                     fault value is 300. This parameter is optional but if you
                     specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for
                     SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

              CompressionFormat -> (string)
                 The compression format. If no value is specified, the default
                 is UNCOMPRESSED .

                 The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for
                 Amazon  Redshift  destinations because they are not supported
                 by the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the  S3
                 bucket.

              EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The  encryption  configuration. If no value is specified, the
                 default is no encryption.

                 NoEncryptionConfig -> (string)
                     Specifically override existing encryption information  to
                     ensure that no encryption is used.

                        Must belong to the same Amazon Web Services Region  as
                        the  destination  Amazon  S3 bucket. For more informa-
                        tion, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon  Web
                        Services Service Namespaces .

                        records in objects that are delivered  to  Amazon  S3,
                        choose  AppendDelimiterToRecord  as  a processor type.
                        You dont have to put a processor  parameter  when  you
                        select AppendDelimiterToRecord .

                 spaces .

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The "YYYY/MM/DD/HH" time format prefix is automatically  used
                 for  delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a custom
                 prefix, as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects
                 .

              ErrorOutputPrefix -> (string)
                 A  prefix  that Firehose evaluates and adds to failed records
                 before writing them to S3. This  prefix  appears  immediately
                 following the bucket name. For information about how to spec-
                 ify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects .

              BufferingHints -> (structure)
                 The buffering option. If no value is  specified,  BufferingH-
                 ints object default values are used.

                 SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                     Buffer  incoming data to the specified size, in MiBs, be-
                     fore delivering it to the destination. The default  value
                     is  5.  This  parameter  is optional but if you specify a
                     value for it, you must also specify a  value  for  Inter-
                     valInSeconds , and vice versa.

                     We  recommend  setting  this parameter to a value greater
                     than the amount of data you  typically  ingest  into  the
                     Firehose  stream in 10 seconds. For example, if you typi-
                     cally ingest data at 1 MiB/sec, the value  should  be  10
                     MiB or higher.

                 IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                     Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in
                     seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The de-
                     fault value is 300. This parameter is optional but if you
                     specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for
                     SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

              CompressionFormat -> (string)
                 The compression format. If no value is specified, the default
                 is UNCOMPRESSED .

                 The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for
                 Amazon  Redshift  destinations because they are not supported
                 by the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the  S3
                 bucket.

              EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The  encryption  configuration. If no value is specified, the
                 default is no encryption.

                 NoEncryptionConfig -> (string)
                     Specifically override existing encryption information  to
                     ensure that no encryption is used.

                 KMSEncryptionConfig -> (structure)
                     The encryption key.

                     AWSKMSKeyARN -> (string)
                        The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the encryption key.
                        Must belong to the same Amazon Web Services Region  as
                        the  destination  Amazon  S3 bucket. For more informa-
                        tion, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon  Web
                        Services Service Namespaces .

              CloudWatchLoggingOptions -> (structure)
                 The CloudWatch logging options for your Firehose stream.

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     Enables or disables CloudWatch logging.

                 LogGroupName -> (string)
                     The  CloudWatch group name for logging. This value is re-
                     quired if CloudWatch logging is enabled.

                 LogStreamName -> (string)
                     The CloudWatch log stream name for logging. This value is

                 if CloudWatch logging is enabled.

              LogStreamName -> (string)
                 The CloudWatch log stream name for logging. This value is re-
                 quired if CloudWatch logging is enabled.

          SecretsManagerConfiguration -> (structure)
              The configuration that defines how you access secrets for Amazon
              Redshift.

              SecretARN -> (string)
                 The ARN of the secret that stores your credentials.  It  must
                 be  in  the  same region as the Firehose stream and the role.
                 The secret ARN can reside in a  different  account  than  the
                 Firehose  stream  and role as Firehose supports cross-account
                 secret access. This parameter is required when Enabled is set
                 to True .

              RoleARN -> (string)
                 Specifies the role that Firehose assumes when calling the Se-
                 crets Manager API operation. When you provide  the  role,  it
                 overrides any destination specific role defined in the desti-
                 nation configuration. If you do not provide the then  we  use
                 the destination specific role. This parameter is required for
                 Splunk.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether you want to use the  secrets  manager  fea-
                 ture.  When  set  as  True  the secrets manager configuration
                 overwrites the existing secrets in the destination configura-
                 tion.  When it's set to False Firehose falls back to the cre-
                 dentials in the destination configuration.

       --elasticsearch-destination-update (structure)
          Describes an update for a destination in Amazon ES.

          RoleARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to be assumed  by
              Firehose for calling the Amazon ES Configuration API and for in-
              dexing documents. For more information, see Grant  Firehose  Ac-
              cess  to  an  Amazon  S3  Destination  and Amazon Resource Names
              (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces .

          DomainARN -> (string)
              The ARN of the Amazon ES domain. The IAM role must have  permis-
              sions for DescribeDomain , DescribeDomains , and DescribeDomain-
              Config after assuming the IAM role specified in  RoleARN  .  For
              more  information,  see  Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon
              Web Services Service Namespaces .

              Specify either ClusterEndpoint or DomainARN .

          ClusterEndpoint -> (string)
              The endpoint to use when communicating with the cluster. Specify
              either this ClusterEndpoint or the DomainARN field.

          IndexName -> (string)
              The Elasticsearch index name.

          TypeName -> (string)
              The Elasticsearch type name. For Elasticsearch 6.x, there can be
              only one type per index. If you try to specify a new type for an
              existing  index  that already has another type, Firehose returns
              an error during runtime.

              If you upgrade Elasticsearch from 6.x to  7.x  and  dont  update
              your  Firehose  stream, Firehose still delivers data to Elastic-
              search with the old index name and type name. If you want to up-
              date  your  Firehose  stream  with  a new index name, provide an
              empty string for TypeName .

          IndexRotationPeriod -> (string)
              The Elasticsearch index rotation period. Index rotation  appends
              a  timestamp  to  IndexName  to facilitate the expiration of old
              data. For more information, see Index Rotation for the Amazon ES
              Destination . Default value is OneDay .

          BufferingHints -> (structure)
              The  buffering options. If no value is specified, Elasticsearch-
              BufferingHints object default values are used.

              IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                 Buffer incoming data for the specified  period  of  time,  in
                 seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The default
                 value is 300 (5 minutes).

              SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                 Buffer incoming data to the specified size,  in  MBs,  before
                 delivering it to the destination. The default value is 5.

                 We  recommend  setting this parameter to a value greater than
                 the amount of data you typically  ingest  into  the  Firehose
                 stream  in  10  seconds. For example, if you typically ingest
                 data at 1 MB/sec, the value should be 10 MB or higher.

          RetryOptions -> (structure)
              The retry behavior in case Firehose is unable to  deliver  docu-
              ments to Amazon ES. The default value is 300 (5 minutes).

              DurationInSeconds -> (integer)
                 After  an  initial failure to deliver to Amazon ES, the total
                 amount of time during which Firehose  retries  delivery  (in-
                 cluding  the first attempt). After this time has elapsed, the
                 failed documents are written to Amazon S3. Default  value  is
                 300  seconds  (5  minutes). A value of 0 (zero) results in no
                 retries.

          S3Update -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 destination.

              RoleARN -> (string)

                 spaces .

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The "YYYY/MM/DD/HH" time format prefix is automatically  used
                 for  delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a custom
                 prefix, as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects
                 .

              ErrorOutputPrefix -> (string)
                 A  prefix  that Firehose evaluates and adds to failed records
                 before writing them to S3. This  prefix  appears  immediately
                 following the bucket name. For information about how to spec-

                 (structure)
                     Describes a data processor.

                     NOTE:
                        If  you  want  to  add  a  new  line delimiter between
                        records in objects that are delivered  to  Amazon  S3,
                        choose  AppendDelimiterToRecord  as  a processor type.
                        You dont have to put a processor  parameter  when  you
                        select AppendDelimiterToRecord .

                        The type of processor.

                     Parameters -> (list)
                        The processor parameters.

                        (structure)
                            Describes the processor parameter.

                            ParameterName -> (string)
                               The  name  of the parameter. Currently the fol-
                               lowing default values are supported: 3 for Num-
                               berOfRetries  and  60 for the BufferIntervalIn-
                               Seconds . The  BufferSizeInMBs  ranges  between
                               0.2  MB  and  up  to 3MB. The default buffering
                               hint  is  1MB  for  all  destinations,   except
                               Splunk.  For Splunk, the default buffering hint
                               is 256 KB.

                            ParameterValue -> (string)
                               The parameter value.

          CloudWatchLoggingOptions -> (structure)
              The CloudWatch logging options for your Firehose stream.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Enables or disables CloudWatch logging.

              LogGroupName -> (string)
                 The CloudWatch group name for logging. This value is required
                 if CloudWatch logging is enabled.

              LogStreamName -> (string)
                 The CloudWatch log stream name for logging. This value is re-
                 quired if CloudWatch logging is enabled.

          DocumentIdOptions -> (structure)
              Indicates the method for setting up document ID.  The  supported
              methods  are  Firehose generated document ID and OpenSearch Ser-
              vice generated document ID.

              DefaultDocumentIdFormat -> (string)
                 When the FIREHOSE_DEFAULT option is chosen,  Firehose  gener-
                 ates  a  unique document ID for each record based on a unique
                 internal identifier. The  generated  document  ID  is  stable
                 across  multiple  delivery  attempts, which helps prevent the
                 same record from being indexed multiple times with  different
                 document IDs.

                 When  the  NO_DOCUMENT_ID option is chosen, Firehose does not
                 include any document IDs in the requests it sends to the Ama-
                 zon  OpenSearch  Service.  This  causes the Amazon OpenSearch
                 Service domain to generate document IDs. In case of  multiple
                 delivery  attempts,  this may cause the same record to be in-
                 dexed more than once with different document IDs. This option
                 enables write-heavy operations, such as the ingestion of logs
                 and observability data, to consume less resources in the Ama-
                 zon  OpenSearch Service domain, resulting in improved perfor-
                 mance.

       --amazonopensearchservice-destination-update (structure)
          Describes an update for a destination in Amazon OpenSearch Service.

          RoleARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to be assumed  by
              Firehose for calling the Amazon OpenSearch Service Configuration
              API and for indexing documents.

          DomainARN -> (string)
              The ARN of the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain.  The  IAM  role
              must  have  permissions for DescribeDomain, DescribeDomains, and
              DescribeDomainConfig after assuming the IAM  role  specified  in
              RoleARN.

          ClusterEndpoint -> (string)
              The endpoint to use when communicating with the cluster. Specify
              either this ClusterEndpoint or the DomainARN field.

          IndexName -> (string)
              The Amazon OpenSearch Service index name.

          TypeName -> (string)
              The Amazon OpenSearch Service type name. For Elasticsearch  6.x,
              there  can  be  only one type per index. If you try to specify a
              new type for an existing index that already  has  another  type,
              Firehose returns an error during runtime.

              If  you  upgrade  Elasticsearch  from 6.x to 7.x and dont update
              your Firehose stream, Firehose still delivers data  to  Elastic-
              search with the old index name and type name. If you want to up-
              date your Firehose stream with a  new  index  name,  provide  an
              empty string for TypeName.

          IndexRotationPeriod -> (string)
              The Amazon OpenSearch Service index rotation period. Index rota-
              tion appends a timestamp to IndexName to facilitate the  expira-
              tion of old data.

          BufferingHints -> (structure)
              The   buffering   options.   If  no  value  is  specified,  Ama-
              zonopensearchBufferingHints object default values are used.

              IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                 Buffer incoming data for the specified  period  of  time,  in
                 seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The default
                 value is 300 (5 minutes).

              SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                 Buffer incoming data to the specified size,  in  MBs,  before
                 delivering it to the destination. The default value is 5.

                 We  recommend  setting this parameter to a value greater than
                 the amount of data you typically  ingest  into  the  Firehose
                 stream  in  10  seconds. For example, if you typically ingest
                 data at 1 MB/sec, the value should be 10 MB or higher.

          RetryOptions -> (structure)
              The retry behavior in case Firehose is unable to  deliver  docu-
              ments  to Amazon OpenSearch Service. The default value is 300 (5
              minutes).

              DurationInSeconds -> (integer)
                 After an initial failure to deliver to Amazon OpenSearch Ser-
                 vice,  the total amount of time during which Firehose retries
                 delivery (including the first attempt). After this  time  has
                 elapsed,  the  failed documents are written to Amazon S3. De-
                 fault value is 300 seconds (5 minutes). A value of  0  (zero)
                 results in no retries.

          S3Update -> (structure)
              Describes an update for a destination in Amazon S3.

              RoleARN -> (string)

              BucketARN -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of  the S3 bucket. For more information, see Amazon
                 Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services  Service  Name-
                 spaces .

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The  "YYYY/MM/DD/HH" time format prefix is automatically used
                 for delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a  custom
                 prefix, as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects
                 .

              ErrorOutputPrefix -> (string)
                 A prefix that Firehose evaluates and adds to  failed  records
                 before  writing  them  to S3. This prefix appears immediately
                 following the bucket name. For information about how to spec-
                 ify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects .

              BufferingHints -> (structure)
                 The  buffering  option. If no value is specified, BufferingH-
                 ints object default values are used.

                 SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                     Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in MiBs,  be-
                     fore  delivering it to the destination. The default value
                     is 5. This parameter is optional but  if  you  specify  a
                     value  for  it,  you must also specify a value for Inter-
                     valInSeconds , and vice versa.

                     We recommend setting this parameter to  a  value  greater
                     than  the  amount  of  data you typically ingest into the
                     Firehose stream in 10 seconds. For example, if you  typi-
                     cally  ingest  data  at 1 MiB/sec, the value should be 10
                     MiB or higher.

                 IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                     Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in
                     seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The de-
                     fault value is 300. This parameter is optional but if you
                     specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for
                     SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

              CompressionFormat -> (string)
                 The compression format. If no value is specified, the default
                 is UNCOMPRESSED .

                 The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for
                 Amazon Redshift destinations because they are  not  supported
                 by  the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the S3
                 bucket.

              EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The encryption configuration. If no value is  specified,  the
                 default is no encryption.

                 NoEncryptionConfig -> (string)
                     Specifically  override existing encryption information to
                     ensure that no encryption is used.

                 KMSEncryptionConfig -> (structure)
                     The encryption key.

                     AWSKMSKeyARN -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the encryption  key.
                        Must  belong to the same Amazon Web Services Region as
                        the destination Amazon S3 bucket.  For  more  informa-
                        tion,  see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web
                        Services Service Namespaces .

                 Enables or disables CloudWatch logging.

              LogGroupName -> (string)
                 The CloudWatch group name for logging. This value is required
                 if CloudWatch logging is enabled.

              LogStreamName -> (string)
                 The CloudWatch log stream name for logging. This value is re-
                 quired if CloudWatch logging is enabled.

          DocumentIdOptions -> (structure)
              Indicates the method for setting up document ID.  The  supported
              methods  are  Firehose generated document ID and OpenSearch Ser-
              vice generated document ID.

              DefaultDocumentIdFormat -> (string)
                 When the FIREHOSE_DEFAULT option is chosen,  Firehose  gener-
                 ates  a  unique document ID for each record based on a unique
                 internal identifier. The  generated  document  ID  is  stable
                 across  multiple  delivery  attempts, which helps prevent the
                 same record from being indexed multiple times with  different
                 document IDs.

                 When  the  NO_DOCUMENT_ID option is chosen, Firehose does not
                 include any document IDs in the requests it sends to the Ama-
                 zon  OpenSearch  Service.  This  causes the Amazon OpenSearch
                 Service domain to generate document IDs. In case of  multiple
                 delivery  attempts,  this may cause the same record to be in-
                 dexed more than once with different document IDs. This option
                 enables write-heavy operations, such as the ingestion of logs
                 and observability data, to consume less resources in the Ama-
                 zon  OpenSearch Service domain, resulting in improved perfor-
                 mance.

          Describes an update for a destination in Splunk.

          HECEndpoint -> (string)
              The HTTP Event Collector (HEC) endpoint to which Firehose  sends
              your data.

          HECEndpointType -> (string)
              This type can be either "Raw" or "Event."

          HECToken -> (string)
              A  GUID that you obtain from your Splunk cluster when you create
              a new HEC endpoint.

          HECAcknowledgmentTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
              The amount of time that Firehose waits to receive an acknowledg-
              ment  from Splunk after it sends data. At the end of the timeout
              period, Firehose either tries to send the data again or  consid-
              ers it an error, based on your retry settings.

          RetryOptions -> (structure)
              The retry behavior in case Firehose is unable to deliver data to
              Splunk or if it doesn't receive  an  acknowledgment  of  receipt
              from Splunk.

              DurationInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The  total  amount  of  time that Firehose spends on retries.
                 This duration starts after the initial attempt to  send  data
                 to  Splunk fails. It doesn't include the periods during which
                 Firehose waits for acknowledgment from Splunk after each  at-
                 tempt.

          S3BackupMode -> (string)
              Specifies  how  you want Firehose to back up documents to Amazon
              S3. When set to FailedDocumentsOnly , Firehose writes  any  data
              that  could  not be indexed to the configured Amazon S3 destina-
              tion. When set to AllEvents ,  Firehose  delivers  all  incoming
              records to Amazon S3, and also writes failed documents to Amazon
              S3. The default value is FailedEventsOnly .

              You can update this backup mode  from  FailedEventsOnly  to  Al-
              lEvents . You can't update it from AllEvents to FailedEventsOnly
              .

                 credentials. For more information, see Amazon Resource  Names
                 (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces .

              BucketARN -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of  the S3 bucket. For more information, see Amazon
                 Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services  Service  Name-
                 spaces .

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The  "YYYY/MM/DD/HH" time format prefix is automatically used
                 for delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a  custom
                 prefix, as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects
                 .

              ErrorOutputPrefix -> (string)
                 A prefix that Firehose evaluates and adds to  failed  records
                 before  writing  them  to S3. This prefix appears immediately
                 following the bucket name. For information about how to spec-
                 ify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects .

              BufferingHints -> (structure)
                 The  buffering  option. If no value is specified, BufferingH-
                 ints object default values are used.

                 SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                     Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in MiBs,  be-
                     fore  delivering it to the destination. The default value
                     is 5. This parameter is optional but  if  you  specify  a
                     value  for  it,  you must also specify a value for Inter-
                     valInSeconds , and vice versa.

                     We recommend setting this parameter to  a  value  greater
                     than  the  amount  of  data you typically ingest into the
                     Firehose stream in 10 seconds. For example, if you  typi-
                     cally  ingest  data  at 1 MiB/sec, the value should be 10
                     MiB or higher.

                 IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                     Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in
                     seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The de-
                     fault value is 300. This parameter is optional but if you
                     specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for
                     SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

              CompressionFormat -> (string)
                 The compression format. If no value is specified, the default
                 is UNCOMPRESSED .

                 The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for
                 Amazon Redshift destinations because they are  not  supported
                 by  the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the S3
                 bucket.

              EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The encryption configuration. If no value is  specified,  the
                 default is no encryption.

                        Must  belong to the same Amazon Web Services Region as
                        the destination Amazon S3 bucket.  For  more  informa-
                        tion,  see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web
                        Services Service Namespaces .

                     NOTE:
                        If you want  to  add  a  new  line  delimiter  between
                        records  in  objects  that are delivered to Amazon S3,
                        choose AppendDelimiterToRecord as  a  processor  type.
                        You  dont  have  to put a processor parameter when you
                        select AppendDelimiterToRecord .

                     Type -> (string)

                               The name of the parameter. Currently  the  fol-
                               lowing default values are supported: 3 for Num-
                               berOfRetries and 60 for  the  BufferIntervalIn-
                               Seconds  .  The  BufferSizeInMBs ranges between
                               0.2 MB and up to  3MB.  The  default  buffering
                               hint   is  1MB  for  all  destinations,  except
                               Splunk. For Splunk, the default buffering  hint
                               is 256 KB.

                 if CloudWatch logging is enabled.

              LogStreamName -> (string)
                 The CloudWatch log stream name for logging. This value is re-
                 quired if CloudWatch logging is enabled.

          BufferingHints -> (structure)
              The  buffering  options.  If  no value is specified, the default
              values for Splunk are used.

              IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                 Buffer incoming data for the specified  period  of  time,  in

          SecretsManagerConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  configuration  that  defines  how  you  access  secrets for
              Splunk.

              SecretARN -> (string)
                 The ARN of the secret that stores your credentials.  It  must
                 be  in  the  same region as the Firehose stream and the role.
                 The secret ARN can reside in a  different  account  than  the
                 Firehose  stream  and role as Firehose supports cross-account
                 secret access. This parameter is required when Enabled is set
                 to True .

              RoleARN -> (string)
                 Specifies the role that Firehose assumes when calling the Se-
                 crets Manager API operation. When you provide  the  role,  it
                 overrides any destination specific role defined in the desti-
                 nation configuration. If you do not provide the then  we  use
                 the destination specific role. This parameter is required for
                 Splunk.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether you want to use the  secrets  manager  fea-
                 ture.  When  set  as  True  the secrets manager configuration
                 overwrites the existing secrets in the destination configura-
                 tion.  When it's set to False Firehose falls back to the cre-
                 dentials in the destination configuration.

          BufferingHints -> (structure)
              Describes  buffering options that can be applied to the data be-
              fore it is delivered to the HTTPS endpoint destination. Firehose
              teats  these  options  as hints, and it might choose to use more
              optimal values. The SizeInMBs and  IntervalInSeconds  parameters
              are  optional.  However, if specify a value for one of them, you
              must also provide a value for the other.

              SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                 Buffer incoming data to the specified size,  in  MBs,  before

                 We  recommend  setting this parameter to a value greater than
                 the amount of data you typically  ingest  into  the  Firehose
                 stream  in  10  seconds. For example, if you typically ingest
                 data at 1 MB/sec, the value should be 10 MB or higher.

              IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                 Buffer incoming data for the specified  period  of  time,  in
                 seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The default
                 value is 300 (5 minutes).

                               0.2 MB and up to  3MB.  The  default  buffering
                               hint   is  1MB  for  all  destinations,  except
                               Splunk. For Splunk, the default buffering  hint
                               is 256 KB.

                            ParameterValue -> (string)

              Describes the retry behavior in case Firehose is unable  to  de-
              liver  data to the specified HTTP endpoint destination, or if it
              doesn't receive a valid acknowledgment of receipt from the spec-
              ified HTTP endpoint destination.

              DurationInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The  total  amount  of  time that Firehose spends on retries.
                 This duration starts after the initial attempt to  send  data
                 to  the  custom  destination  via  HTTPS  endpoint  fails. It
                 doesn't include the periods during which Firehose  waits  for

                 (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces .

              BucketARN -> (string)
                 The ARN of the S3 bucket. For more  information,  see  Amazon
                 Resource  Names  (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Name-
                 spaces .

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The "YYYY/MM/DD/HH" time format prefix is automatically  used
                 for  delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a custom

              BufferingHints -> (structure)
                 The buffering option. If no value is  specified,  BufferingH-
                 ints object default values are used.

                 SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                     Buffer  incoming data to the specified size, in MiBs, be-
                     fore delivering it to the destination. The default  value
                     is  5.  This  parameter  is optional but if you specify a
                     value for it, you must also specify a  value  for  Inter-
                     valInSeconds , and vice versa.

                     We  recommend  setting  this parameter to a value greater
                     than the amount of data you  typically  ingest  into  the
                     Firehose  stream in 10 seconds. For example, if you typi-
                     cally ingest data at 1 MiB/sec, the value  should  be  10
                     MiB or higher.

                 IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                     Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in
                     seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The de-
                     fault value is 300. This parameter is optional but if you
                     specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for
                     SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

              CompressionFormat -> (string)
                 The compression format. If no value is specified, the default
                 is UNCOMPRESSED .

                 The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for
                 Amazon  Redshift  destinations because they are not supported
                 by the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the  S3
                 bucket.

              EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The  encryption  configuration. If no value is specified, the
                 default is no encryption.

                 NoEncryptionConfig -> (string)
                     Specifically override existing encryption information  to

                     The encryption key.

                     AWSKMSKeyARN -> (string)
                        The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the encryption key.
                        Must belong to the same Amazon Web Services Region  as
                        the  destination  Amazon  S3 bucket. For more informa-
                        tion, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon  Web
                        Services Service Namespaces .

              CloudWatchLoggingOptions -> (structure)
                 The CloudWatch logging options for your Firehose stream.

                 Enabled -> (boolean)

                 LogGroupName -> (string)
                     The  CloudWatch group name for logging. This value is re-
                     quired if CloudWatch logging is enabled.

                 LogStreamName -> (string)
                     The CloudWatch log stream name for logging. This value is
                     required if CloudWatch logging is enabled.

          SecretsManagerConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  configuration  that defines how you access secrets for HTTP
              Endpoint destination.

              SecretARN -> (string)
                 The ARN of the secret that stores your credentials.  It  must
                 be  in  the  same region as the Firehose stream and the role.
                 The secret ARN can reside in a  different  account  than  the
                 Firehose  stream  and role as Firehose supports cross-account
                 secret access. This parameter is required when Enabled is set
                 to True .

              RoleARN -> (string)
                 Specifies the role that Firehose assumes when calling the Se-
                 crets Manager API operation. When you provide  the  role,  it
                 overrides any destination specific role defined in the desti-
                 nation configuration. If you do not provide the then  we  use
                 the destination specific role. This parameter is required for
                 Splunk.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether you want to use the  secrets  manager  fea-
                 ture.  When  set  as  True  the secrets manager configuration
                 overwrites the existing secrets in the destination configura-
                 tion.  When it's set to False Firehose falls back to the cre-
                 dentials in the destination configuration.

              name.

          BufferingHints -> (structure)
              The   buffering   options.   If  no  value  is  specified,  Ama-
              zonopensearchBufferingHints object default values are used.

              IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                 Buffer incoming data for the specified  period  of  time,  in
                 seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The default
                 value is 300 (5 minutes).

                 Buffer incoming data to the specified size,  in  MBs,  before
                 delivering it to the destination. The default value is 5.

                 We  recommend  setting this parameter to a value greater than
                 the amount of data you typically  ingest  into  the  Firehose
                 stream  in  10  seconds. For example, if you typically ingest

                 After an initial failure to deliver to the Serverless  offer-
                 ing  for  Amazon OpenSearch Service, the total amount of time
                 during which Firehose retries delivery (including  the  first
                 attempt).  After  this time has elapsed, the failed documents
                 are written to Amazon S3. Default value  is  300  seconds  (5
                 minutes). A value of 0 (zero) results in no retries.

                     value  for  it,  you must also specify a value for Inter-
                     valInSeconds , and vice versa.

                     We recommend setting this parameter to  a  value  greater
                     than  the  amount  of  data you typically ingest into the
                     Firehose stream in 10 seconds. For example, if you  typi-
                     cally  ingest  data  at 1 MiB/sec, the value should be 10
                     MiB or higher.

                 IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                     Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in

          RetryOptions -> (structure)
              Specify how long Firehose retries sending data to the New  Relic
              HTTP  endpoint.  After sending data, Firehose first waits for an
              acknowledgment from the HTTP endpoint. If an error occurs or the
              acknowledgment  doesnt  arrive within the acknowledgment timeout
              period, Firehose starts the retry  duration  counter.  It  keeps
              retrying  until the retry duration expires. After that, Firehose
              considers it a data delivery failure and backs up  the  data  to
              your  Amazon  S3  bucket. Every time that Firehose sends data to
              the HTTP endpoint (either the initial attempt or  a  retry),  it
              restarts  the  acknowledgement  timeout counter and waits for an
              acknowledgement from the HTTP endpoint. Even if the retry  dura-
              tion  expires, Firehose still waits for the acknowledgment until
              it receives it or the acknowledgement timeout period is reached.
              If  the  acknowledgment  times  out, Firehose determines whether
              there's time left in the retry counter. If there is  time  left,
              it  retries again and repeats the logic until it receives an ac-
              knowledgment or determines that the retry time has  expired.  If
              you don't want Firehose to retry sending data, set this value to
              0.

              DurationInSeconds -> (integer)
                 the time period where Firehose will retry sending data to the
                 chosen HTTP endpoint.

          S3BackupMode -> (string)
              Choose an S3 backup mode. Once you set the mode as AllData , you
              can not change it to FailedDataOnly .

                 credentials.  For more information, see Amazon Resource Names
                 (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces .

              BucketARN -> (string)
                 The ARN of the S3 bucket. For more  information,  see  Amazon
                 Resource  Names  (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Name-
                 spaces .

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The "YYYY/MM/DD/HH" time format prefix is automatically  used
                 for  delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a custom
                 prefix, as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects
                 .

              ErrorOutputPrefix -> (string)
                 A  prefix  that Firehose evaluates and adds to failed records
                 before writing them to S3. This  prefix  appears  immediately
                 following the bucket name. For information about how to spec-
                 ify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects .

              BufferingHints -> (structure)
                 The buffering option. If no value is  specified,  BufferingH-

                     Buffer  incoming data to the specified size, in MiBs, be-
                     fore delivering it to the destination. The default  value
                     is  5.  This  parameter  is optional but if you specify a
                     value for it, you must also specify a  value  for  Inter-
                     valInSeconds , and vice versa.

                     We  recommend  setting  this parameter to a value greater
                     than the amount of data you  typically  ingest  into  the
                     Firehose  stream in 10 seconds. For example, if you typi-
                     cally ingest data at 1 MiB/sec, the value  should  be  10
                     MiB or higher.

                 IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                     Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in
                     seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The de-
                     fault value is 300. This parameter is optional but if you
                     specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for
                     SizeInMBs , and vice versa.

              CompressionFormat -> (string)
                 The compression format. If no value is specified, the default
                 is UNCOMPRESSED .

                 The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for
                 Amazon  Redshift  destinations because they are not supported
                 by the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the  S3
                 bucket.

              EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The  encryption  configuration. If no value is specified, the
                 default is no encryption.

                 NoEncryptionConfig -> (string)
                     Specifically override existing encryption information  to
                     ensure that no encryption is used.

                 KMSEncryptionConfig -> (structure)
                     The encryption key.

                     AWSKMSKeyARN -> (string)
                        The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the encryption key.
                        Must belong to the same Amazon Web Services Region  as
                        the  destination  Amazon  S3 bucket. For more informa-
                        tion, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon  Web
                        Services Service Namespaces .

              CloudWatchLoggingOptions -> (structure)
                 The CloudWatch logging options for your Firehose stream.

                 Enabled -> (boolean)

                     quired if CloudWatch logging is enabled.

                 LogStreamName -> (string)
                     The CloudWatch log stream name for logging. This value is
                     required if CloudWatch logging is enabled.

          SecretsManagerConfiguration -> (structure)
              Describes the Secrets Manager configuration in Snowflake.

              SecretARN -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of the secret that stores your credentials. It must
                 be in the same region as the Firehose stream  and  the  role.
                 The  secret  ARN  can  reside in a different account than the
                 Firehose stream and role as Firehose  supports  cross-account
                 secret access. This parameter is required when Enabled is set
                 to True .

              RoleARN -> (string)
                 Specifies the role that Firehose assumes when calling the Se-
                 crets  Manager  API  operation. When you provide the role, it
                 overrides any destination specific role defined in the desti-
                 nation  configuration.  If you do not provide the then we use
                 the destination specific role. This parameter is required for
                 Splunk.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  you  want to use the secrets manager fea-
                 ture. When set as  True  the  secrets  manager  configuration
                 overwrites the existing secrets in the destination configura-
                 tion. When it's set to False Firehose falls back to the  cre-
                 dentials in the destination configuration.

          BufferingHints -> (structure)
              Describes the buffering to perform before delivering data to the
              Snowflake destination.

              SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                 Buffer incoming data to the specified size,  in  MBs,  before
                 delivering it to the destination. The default value is 128.

              IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                 Buffer  incoming  data  for  the specified period of time, in
                 seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The default
                 value is 0.

          BufferingHints -> (structure)
              Describes  hints  for the buffering to perform before delivering
              data to the destination. These options are treated as hints, and
              therefore  Firehose might choose to use different values when it
              is optimal. The SizeInMBs and IntervalInSeconds  parameters  are
              optional.  However, if specify a value for one of them, you must
              also provide a value for the other.

              SizeInMBs -> (integer)
                 Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in  MiBs,  before
                 delivering  it  to  the  destination. The default value is 5.
                 This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it,
                 you  must  also  specify  a value for IntervalInSeconds , and
                 vice versa.

                 We recommend setting this parameter to a value  greater  than
                 the  amount  of  data  you typically ingest into the Firehose
                 stream in 10 seconds. For example, if  you  typically  ingest
                 data at 1 MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or higher.

              IntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                 Buffer  incoming  data  for  the specified period of time, in
                 seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The default
                 value is 300. This parameter is optional but if you specify a
                 value for it, you must also specify a value for  SizeInMBs  ,
                 and vice versa.

                        records  in  objects  that are delivered to Amazon S3,
                        choose AppendDelimiterToRecord as  a  processor  type.
                        You  dont  have  to put a processor parameter when you
                        select AppendDelimiterToRecord .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
