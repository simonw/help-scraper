DESCRIPTION
       Welcome to the Amazon SQS API Reference .

       Amazon SQS is a reliable, highly-scalable hosted queue for storing mes-
       sages as they travel between applications or microservices. Amazon  SQS
       moves data between distributed application components and helps you de-
       couple these components.

       For information on the permissions  you  need  to  use  this  API,  see
       Identity and access management in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.

       You  can  use  Amazon Web Services SDKs to access Amazon SQS using your
       favorite programming language. The SDKs perform tasks such as the  fol-
       lowing automatically:

       o Cryptographically sign your service requests

       o Retry requests

       o Handle error responses
