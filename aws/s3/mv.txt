OPTIONS
       paths (string)

       --dryrun  (boolean) Displays the operations that would be performed us-
       ing the specified command without actually running them.

       --quiet (boolean) Does not display the operations  performed  from  the
       specified command.

       --include  (string)  Don't exclude files or objects in the command that
       match the specified pattern. See Use of Exclude and Include Filters for
       details.

       --exclude  (string)  Exclude all files or objects from the command that
       matches the specified pattern.

       --acl (string) Sets the ACL for the object when  the  command  is  per-
       formed.  If  you use this parameter you must have the "s3:PutObjectAcl"
       permission included in the list of actions for your  IAM  policy.  Only
       accepts  values  of  private, public-read, public-read-write, authenti-
       cated-read, aws-exec-read, bucket-owner-read, bucket-owner-full-control
       and log-delivery-write. See Canned ACL for details

       --follow-symlinks  |  --no-follow-symlinks (boolean) Symbolic links are
       followed only when uploading to S3 from the local filesystem. Note that
       S3  does not support symbolic links, so the contents of the link target
       are uploaded under the name of the link. When neither --follow-symlinks
       nor  --no-follow-symlinks  is  specified, the default is to follow sym-
       links.

       --no-guess-mime-type (boolean) Do not try to guess the  mime  type  for
       uploaded  files.  By default the mime type of a file is guessed when it
       is uploaded.

       --sse (string) Specifies server-side encryption of the  object  in  S3.
       Valid  values are AES256 and aws:kms. If the parameter is specified but
       no value is provided, AES256 is used.

       --sse-c (string) Specifies server-side encryption using  customer  pro-
       vided  keys of the the object in S3. AES256 is the only valid value. If
       the parameter is specified but no value is provided, AES256 is used. If
       you provide this value, --sse-c-key must be specified as well.

       --sse-c-key  (blob)  The  customer-provided  encryption  key  to use to
       server-side encrypt the object  in  S3.  If  you  provide  this  value,
       --sse-c  must  be  specified  as  well.  The key provided should not be
       base64 encoded.

       --sse-kms-key-id (string) The customer-managed AWS Key Management  Ser-
       vice (KMS) key ID that should be used to server-side encrypt the object
       in S3. You should only provide this parameter if you are using  a  cus-
       tomer  managed  customer  master  key (CMK) and not the AWS managed KMS
       CMK.

       --sse-c-copy-source (string) This parameter should  only  be  specified
       when  copying  an  S3 object that was encrypted server-side with a cus-
       tomer-provided key. It specifies the algorithm to use  when  decrypting
       the  source object. AES256 is the only valid value. If the parameter is
       specified but no value is provided, AES256 is used. If you provide this
       value, --sse-c-copy-source-key must be specified as well.

       --sse-c-copy-source-key  (blob) This parameter should only be specified
       when copying an S3 object that was encrypted server-side  with  a  cus-
       tomer-provided  key. Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for
       Amazon S3 to use to decrypt the source object. The encryption key  pro-
       vided  must be one that was used when the source object was created. If
       you provide this value, --sse-c-copy-source be specified as  well.  The
       key provided should not be base64 encoded.

       --storage-class  (string)  The  type  of storage to use for the object.
       Valid choices are: STANDARD | REDUCED_REDUNDANCY | STANDARD_IA  |  ONE-
       ZONE_IA  |  INTELLIGENT_TIERING  | GLACIER | DEEP_ARCHIVE | GLACIER_IR.
       Defaults to 'STANDARD'

       --grants (string)
          Grant specific permissions to individual users or  groups.  You  can
          supply a list of grants of the form

              --grants Permission=Grantee_Type=Grantee_ID [Permission=Grantee_Type=Grantee_ID ...]

          To  specify  the same permission type for multiple grantees, specify
          the permission as such as

              --grants Permission=Grantee_Type=Grantee_ID,Grantee_Type=Grantee_ID,...

          Each value contains the following elements:

          o Permission - Specifies the granted permissions, and can be set  to
            read, readacl, writeacl, or full.

          o Grantee_Type  - Specifies how the grantee is to be identified, and
            can be set to uri or id.

          o Grantee_ID - Specifies the  grantee  based  on  Grantee_Type.  The
            Grantee_ID value can be one of:

            o uri  -  The  group's  URI.  For  more  information, see Who Is a
              Grantee?

            o id - The account's canonical ID

          For more information on Amazon S3 access control, see Access Control

       --website-redirect (string) If the bucket is configured as  a  website,
       redirects requests for this object to another object in the same bucket
       or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the
       object metadata.

       --content-type (string) Specify an explicit content type for this oper-
       ation. This value overrides any guessed mime types.

       --cache-control (string)  Specifies  caching  behavior  along  the  re-
       quest/reply chain.

       --content-disposition (string) Specifies presentational information for
       the object.

       --content-encoding (string) Specifies what content encodings have  been
       applied to the object and thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied
       to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field.

       --content-language (string) The language the content is in.

       --expires (string) The date and time at which the object is  no  longer
       cacheable.

       --source-region (string) When transferring objects from an s3 bucket to
       an s3 bucket, this specifies the region of the source bucket. Note  the
       region specified by --region or through configuration of the CLI refers
       to the region of the destination  bucket.  If  --source-region  is  not
       specified  the  region  of the source will be the same as the region of
       the destination bucket.

       --only-show-errors (boolean) Only errors and  warnings  are  displayed.
       All other output is suppressed.

       --no-progress  (boolean)  File transfer progress is not displayed. This
       flag is only applied when the quiet and only-show-errors flags are  not
       provided.

       --page-size  (integer) The number of results to return in each response
       to a list operation. The default value is 1000 (the  maximum  allowed).
       Using a lower value may help if an operation times out.

       --ignore-glacier-warnings  (boolean)  Turns off glacier warnings. Warn-
       ings about an operation that cannot be performed  because  it  involves
       copying,  downloading,  or  moving  a  glacier object will no longer be
       printed to standard error and will no longer cause the return  code  of
       the command to be 2.

       --force-glacier-transfer  (boolean)  Forces  a  transfer request on all
       Glacier objects in a sync or recursive copy.

       --request-payer (string) Confirms that the requester  knows  that  they
       will  be  charged  for the request. Bucket owners need not specify this
       parameter in their requests. Documentation on downloading objects  from
       requester       pays       buckets       can      be      found      at
       http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html

       --metadata  (map)  A  map  of metadata to store with the objects in S3.
       This will be applied to every object which is part of this request.  In
       a  sync,  this means that files which haven't changed won't receive the
       new metadata. When copying between two s3 locations,  the  metadata-di-
       rective  argument  will  default  to  'REPLACE' unless otherwise speci-
       fied.key -> (string)
          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --metadata-directive (string) Specifies whether the metadata is  copied
       from  the source object or replaced with metadata provided when copying
       S3 objects. Note that if the object is copied over in parts, the source
       object's  metadata  will  not  be  copied over, no matter the value for
       --metadata-directive, and instead the desired metadata values  must  be
       specified  as parameters on the command line. Valid values are COPY and
       REPLACE. If this parameter is not specified, COPY will be used  by  de-
       fault.  If  REPLACE is used, the copied object will only have the meta-
       data values that were specified by the CLI command. Note  that  if  you
       are using any of the following parameters: --content-type, content-lan-
       guage, --content-encoding, --content-disposition,  --cache-control,  or
       --expires,  you  will  need to specify --metadata-directive REPLACE for
       non-multipart copies if you want the copied objects to have the  speci-
       fied metadata values.

       --recursive  (boolean) Command is performed on all files or objects un-
       der the specified directory or prefix.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following mv command moves a single file to a specified bucket  and
       key:

          aws s3 mv test.txt s3://mybucket/test2.txt

       Output:

          move: test.txt to s3://mybucket/test2.txt

       The following mv command moves a single s3 object to a specified bucket
       and key:

          aws s3 mv s3://mybucket/test.txt s3://mybucket/test2.txt

       Output:

          move: s3://mybucket/test.txt to s3://mybucket/test2.txt

       The following mv command moves a single object to a specified file  lo-
       cally:

          aws s3 mv s3://mybucket/test.txt test2.txt

       Output:

          move: s3://mybucket/test.txt to test2.txt

       The  following  mv  command moves a single object to a specified bucket
       while retaining its original name:

          aws s3 mv s3://mybucket/test.txt s3://mybucket2/

       Output:

          move: s3://mybucket/test.txt to s3://mybucket2/test.txt

       When passed with the parameter --recursive, the  following  mv  command
       recursively  moves all objects under a specified prefix and bucket to a
       specified directory.  In this example, the bucket mybucket has the  ob-
       jects test1.txt and test2.txt:

          aws s3 mv s3://mybucket . --recursive

       Output:

          move: s3://mybucket/test1.txt to test1.txt
          move: s3://mybucket/test2.txt to test2.txt

       When  passed  with  the parameter --recursive, the following mv command
       recursively moves all files under a specified directory to a  specified
       bucket  and prefix while excluding some files by using an --exclude pa-
       rameter. In this example, the directory myDir has the  files  test1.txt
       and test2.jpg:

          aws s3 mv myDir s3://mybucket/ --recursive --exclude "*.jpg"

       Output:

          move: myDir/test1.txt to s3://mybucket2/test1.txt

       When  passed  with  the parameter --recursive, the following mv command
       recursively moves all objects  under  a  specified  bucket  to  another
       bucket  while  excluding  some objects by using an --exclude parameter.
       In this example, the bucket mybucket has the objects test1.txt and  an-
       other/test1.txt:

          aws s3 mv s3://mybucket/ s3://mybucket2/ --recursive --exclude "mybucket/another/*"

       Output:

          move: s3://mybucket/test1.txt to s3://mybucket2/test1.txt

       The  following  mv  command moves a single object to a specified bucket
       and key while setting the ACL to public-read-write:

          aws s3 mv s3://mybucket/test.txt s3://mybucket/test2.txt --acl public-read-write

       Output:

          move: s3://mybucket/test.txt to s3://mybucket/test2.txt

       The following mv command illustrates the use of the --grants option  to
       grant  read  access  to  all  users and full control to a specific user
       identified by their email address:

          aws s3 mv file.txt s3://mybucket/ --grants read=uri=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers full=emailaddress=user@example.com

       Output:

          move: file.txt to s3://mybucket/file.txt

       Moving a file to an S3 access point

       The following mv command moves a single file (mydoc.txt) to the  access
       point (myaccesspoint) at the key (mykey):

          aws s3 mv mydoc.txt s3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/mykey

       Output:

          move: mydoc.txt to s3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/mykey



                                                                          MV()
