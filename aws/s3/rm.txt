SYNOPSIS
            rm
          <S3Uri>
          [--dryrun]
          [--quiet]
          [--recursive]
          [--request-payer <value>]
          [--include <value>]
          [--exclude <value>]
          [--only-show-errors]
          [--page-size <value>]

OPTIONS
       paths (string)

       --dryrun  (boolean) Displays the operations that would be performed us-
       ing the specified command without actually running them.

       --quiet (boolean) Does not display the operations  performed  from  the
       specified command.

       --recursive  (boolean) Command is performed on all files or objects un-
       der the specified directory or prefix.

       --request-payer (string) Confirms that the requester  knows  that  they
       will  be  charged  for the request. Bucket owners need not specify this
       parameter in their requests. Documentation on downloading objects  from
       requester       pays       buckets       can      be      found      at
       http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html

       --include  (string)  Don't exclude files or objects in the command that
       match the specified pattern. See Use of Exclude and Include Filters for
       details.

       --exclude  (string)  Exclude all files or objects from the command that
       matches the specified pattern.

       --only-show-errors (boolean) Only errors and  warnings  are  displayed.
       All other output is suppressed.

       --page-size  (integer) The number of results to return in each response
       to a list operation. The default value is 1000 (the  maximum  allowed).
       Using a lower value may help if an operation times out.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following rm command deletes a single s3 object:

          aws s3 rm s3://mybucket/test2.txt

       Output:

          delete: s3://mybucket/test2.txt

       The following rm command recursively deletes all objects under a speci-
       fied bucket and prefix when passed with the parameter --recursive.   In
       this  example,  the  bucket mybucket contains the objects test1.txt and
       test2.txt:

          aws s3 rm s3://mybucket --recursive

       Output:

          delete: s3://mybucket/test1.txt
          delete: s3://mybucket/test2.txt

       The following rm command recursively deletes all objects under a speci-
       fied bucket and prefix when passed with the parameter --recursive while
       excluding some objects by using an --exclude parameter.  In this  exam-
       ple, the bucket mybucket has the objects test1.txt and test2.jpg:

          aws s3 rm s3://mybucket/ --recursive --exclude "*.jpg"

       Output:

          delete: s3://mybucket/test1.txt

       The following rm command recursively deletes all objects under a speci-
       fied bucket and prefix when passed with the parameter --recursive while
       excluding  all  objects under a particular prefix by using an --exclude
       parameter.  In this  example,  the  bucket  mybucket  has  the  objects
       test1.txt and another/test.txt:

          aws s3 rm s3://mybucket/ --recursive --exclude "another/*"

       Output:

          delete: s3://mybucket/test1.txt

       Deleting an object from an S3 access point

       The  following  rm command deletes a single object (mykey) from the ac-
       cess point (myaccesspoint):

          aws s3 rm s3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/mykey

       Output:

          delete: s3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/mykey



                                                                          RM()
