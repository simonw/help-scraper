WEBSITE()                                                            WEBSITE()



NAME
       website -

DESCRIPTION
       Set the website configuration for a bucket.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            website
          <S3Uri>
          [--index-document <value>]
          [--error-document <value>]

OPTIONS
       paths (string)

       --index-document  (string)  A suffix that is appended to a request that
       is for a directory on the website endpoint (e.g. if the suffix  is  in-
       dex.html  and  you make a request to samplebucket/images/ the data that
       is returned will be for the object with the key name images/index.html)
       The suffix must not be empty and must not include a slash character.

       --error-document  (string)  The object key name to use when a 4XX class
       error occurs.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command configures a bucket named my-bucket as  a  static
       website:

          aws s3 website s3://my-bucket/ --index-document index.html --error-document error.html

       The index document option specifies the file in my-bucket that visitors
       will be directed to when they navigate to  the  website  URL.  In  this
       case,  the  bucket is in the us-west-2 region, so the site would appear
       at http://my-bucket.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com.

       All files in the bucket that appear on the static site must be  config-
       ured  to  allow  visitors to open them. File permissions are configured
       separately from the bucket website configuration.  For  information  on
       hosting  a static website in Amazon S3, see Hosting a Static Website in
       the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
