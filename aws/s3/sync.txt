SYNC()                                                                  SYNC()



NAME
       sync -

DESCRIPTION
       Syncs  directories  and S3 prefixes. Recursively copies new and updated
       files from the source directory to the destination. Only creates  fold-
       ers in the destination if they contain one or more files.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       paths (string)

       --dryrun  (boolean) Displays the operations that would be performed us-
       ing the specified command without actually running them.

       --quiet (boolean) Does not display the operations  performed  from  the
       specified command.

       --include  (string)  Don't exclude files or objects in the command that
       match the specified pattern. See Use of Exclude and Include Filters for
       details.

       --exclude  (string)  Exclude all files or objects from the command that
       matches the specified pattern.

       --acl (string) Sets the ACL for the object when  the  command  is  per-
       formed.  If  you use this parameter you must have the "s3:PutObjectAcl"
       permission included in the list of actions for your  IAM  policy.  Only
       accepts  values  of  private, public-read, public-read-write, authenti-
       cated-read, aws-exec-read, bucket-owner-read, bucket-owner-full-control
       and log-delivery-write. See Canned ACL for details

       --follow-symlinks  |  --no-follow-symlinks (boolean) Symbolic links are
       followed only when uploading to S3 from the local filesystem. Note that
       S3  does not support symbolic links, so the contents of the link target
       are uploaded under the name of the link. When neither --follow-symlinks
       nor  --no-follow-symlinks  is  specified, the default is to follow sym-
       links.

       --no-guess-mime-type (boolean) Do not try to guess the  mime  type  for
       uploaded  files.  By default the mime type of a file is guessed when it
       is uploaded.

       --sse (string) Specifies server-side encryption of the  object  in  S3.
       Valid  values are AES256 and aws:kms. If the parameter is specified but
       no value is provided, AES256 is used.

       --sse-c (string) Specifies server-side encryption using  customer  pro-
       vided  keys of the the object in S3. AES256 is the only valid value. If
       the parameter is specified but no value is provided, AES256 is used. If
       you provide this value, --sse-c-key must be specified as well.

       --sse-c-key  (blob)  The  customer-provided  encryption  key  to use to
       server-side encrypt the object  in  S3.  If  you  provide  this  value,
       --sse-c  must  be  specified  as  well.  The key provided should not be
       base64 encoded.

       --sse-kms-key-id (string) The customer-managed AWS Key Management  Ser-
       vice (KMS) key ID that should be used to server-side encrypt the object
       in S3. You should only provide this parameter if you are using  a  cus-
       tomer  managed  customer  master  key (CMK) and not the AWS managed KMS
       CMK.

       --sse-c-copy-source (string) This parameter should  only  be  specified
       when  copying  an  S3 object that was encrypted server-side with a cus-
       tomer-provided key. It specifies the algorithm to use  when  decrypting
       the  source object. AES256 is the only valid value. If the parameter is
       specified but no value is provided, AES256 is used. If you provide this
       value, --sse-c-copy-source-key must be specified as well.

       --sse-c-copy-source-key  (blob) This parameter should only be specified
       when copying an S3 object that was encrypted server-side  with  a  cus-
       tomer-provided  key. Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for
       Amazon S3 to use to decrypt the source object. The encryption key  pro-
       vided  must be one that was used when the source object was created. If
       you provide this value, --sse-c-copy-source be specified as  well.  The
       key provided should not be base64 encoded.

       --storage-class  (string)  The  type  of storage to use for the object.
       Valid choices are: STANDARD | REDUCED_REDUNDANCY | STANDARD_IA  |  ONE-
       ZONE_IA  |  INTELLIGENT_TIERING  | GLACIER | DEEP_ARCHIVE | GLACIER_IR.
       Defaults to 'STANDARD'

       --grants (string)
          Grant specific permissions to individual users or  groups.  You  can
          supply a list of grants of the form

              --grants Permission=Grantee_Type=Grantee_ID [Permission=Grantee_Type=Grantee_ID ...]

          To  specify  the same permission type for multiple grantees, specify
          the permission as such as

              --grants Permission=Grantee_Type=Grantee_ID,Grantee_Type=Grantee_ID,...

          Each value contains the following elements:

          o Permission - Specifies the granted permissions, and can be set  to
            read, readacl, writeacl, or full.

          o Grantee_Type  - Specifies how the grantee is to be identified, and
            can be set to uri or id.

          o Grantee_ID - Specifies the  grantee  based  on  Grantee_Type.  The
            Grantee_ID value can be one of:

            o uri  -  The  group's  URI.  For  more  information, see Who Is a
              Grantee?

            o id - The account's canonical ID

          For more information on Amazon S3 access control, see Access Control

       --website-redirect (string) If the bucket is configured as  a  website,
       redirects requests for this object to another object in the same bucket
       or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the
       object metadata.

       --content-type (string) Specify an explicit content type for this oper-
       ation. This value overrides any guessed mime types.

       --cache-control (string)  Specifies  caching  behavior  along  the  re-
       quest/reply chain.

       --content-disposition (string) Specifies presentational information for
       the object.

       --content-encoding (string) Specifies what content encodings have  been
       applied to the object and thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied
       to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field.

       --content-language (string) The language the content is in.

       --expires (string) The date and time at which the object is  no  longer
       cacheable.

       --source-region (string) When transferring objects from an s3 bucket to
       an s3 bucket, this specifies the region of the source bucket. Note  the
       region specified by --region or through configuration of the CLI refers
       to the region of the destination  bucket.  If  --source-region  is  not
       specified  the  region  of the source will be the same as the region of
       the destination bucket.

       --only-show-errors (boolean) Only errors and  warnings  are  displayed.
       All other output is suppressed.

       --no-progress  (boolean)  File transfer progress is not displayed. This
       flag is only applied when the quiet and only-show-errors flags are  not
       provided.

       --page-size  (integer) The number of results to return in each response
       to a list operation. The default value is 1000 (the  maximum  allowed).
       Using a lower value may help if an operation times out.

       --ignore-glacier-warnings  (boolean)  Turns off glacier warnings. Warn-
       ings about an operation that cannot be performed  because  it  involves
       copying,  downloading,  or  moving  a  glacier object will no longer be
       printed to standard error and will no longer cause the return  code  of
       the command to be 2.

       --force-glacier-transfer  (boolean)  Forces  a  transfer request on all
       Glacier objects in a sync or recursive copy.

       --request-payer (string) Confirms that the requester  knows  that  they
       will  be  charged  for the request. Bucket owners need not specify this
       parameter in their requests. Documentation on downloading objects  from
       requester       pays       buckets       can      be      found      at
       http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html

       --metadata  (map)  A  map  of metadata to store with the objects in S3.
       This will be applied to every object which is part of this request.  In
       a  sync,  this means that files which haven't changed won't receive the
       new metadata. key -> (string)
          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --copy-props (string) Determines which properties are copied  from  the
       source  S3  object.  This  parameter  only applies for S3 to S3 copies.
       Valid values are:

          o none - Do not copy any of the properties from the  source  S3  ob-
            ject.

          o metadata-directive  -  Copies  the  following  properties from the
            source S3 object: content-type,  content-language,  content-encod-
            ing, content-disposition, cache-control, --expires, and metadata

          o default  -  The  default value. Copies tags and properties covered
            under the metadata-directive value from the source S3 object.

          In order to copy the appropriate properties  for  multipart  copies,
          some  of the options may require additional API calls if a multipart
          copy is involved. Specifically:

          o metadata-directive may require additional HeadObject API calls.

          o default may require additional HeadObject,  GetObjectTagging,  and
            PutObjectTagging  API  calls. Note this list of API calls may grow
            in the future in order to ensure multipart copies preserve the ex-
            act properties a CopyObject API call would preserve.

          If you want to guarantee no additional API calls are made other than
          than the ones needed to perform the actual copy, set this option  to
          none.

       --metadata-directive  (string) Sets the x-amz-metadata-directive header
       for CopyObject operations. It is recommended to  use  the  --copy-props
       parameter instead to control copying of metadata properties. If --meta-
       data-directive is set, the --copy-props parameter will be disabled  and
       will have no affect on the transfer.

       --size-only (boolean) Makes the size of each key the only criteria used
       to decide whether to sync from source to destination.

       --exact-timestamps (boolean) When syncing from S3 to local,  same-sized
       items  will  be ignored only when the timestamps match exactly. The de-
       fault behavior is to ignore same-sized items unless the  local  version
       is newer than the S3 version.

       --delete  (boolean)  Files that exist in the destination but not in the
       source are deleted during sync.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following sync command syncs objects under a specified  prefix  and
       bucket  to  files  in a local directory by uploading the local files to
       s3.  A local file will require uploading if the size of the local  file
       is  different than the size of the s3 object, the last modified time of
       the local file is newer than the last modified time of the  s3  object,
       or the local file does not exist under the specified bucket and prefix.
       In this example, the user syncs the bucket mybucket to the  local  cur-
       rent  directory.   The  local  current  directory  contains  the  files
       test.txt and test2.txt.  The bucket mybucket contains no objects:

          aws s3 sync . s3://mybucket

       Output:

          upload: test.txt to s3://mybucket/test.txt
          upload: test2.txt to s3://mybucket/test2.txt

       The following sync command syncs objects under a specified  prefix  and
       bucket  to objects under another specified prefix and bucket by copying
       s3 objects.  A s3 object will require copying if the sizes of  the  two
       s3  objects  differ, the last modified time of the source is newer than
       the last modified time of the destination, or the s3  object  does  not
       exist under the specified bucket and prefix destination.  In this exam-
       ple, the user syncs the bucket mybucket to the bucket  mybucket2.   The
       bucket  mybucket  contains  the  objects  test.txt  and test2.txt.  The
       bucket mybucket2 contains no objects:

          aws s3 sync s3://mybucket s3://mybucket2

       Output:

          copy: s3://mybucket/test.txt to s3://mybucket2/test.txt
          copy: s3://mybucket/test2.txt to s3://mybucket2/test2.txt

       The following sync command syncs files in a local directory to  objects
       under  a  specified  prefix and bucket by downloading s3 objects.  A s3
       object will require downloading if the size of the  s3  object  differs
       from  the  size of the local file, the last modified time of the s3 ob-
       ject is newer than the last modified time of the local file, or the  s3
       object  does not exist in the local directory.  Take note that when ob-
       jects are downloaded from s3, the last modified time of the local  file
       is  changed  to the last modified time of the s3 object.  In this exam-
       ple, the user syncs the current local directory to the bucket mybucket.
       The  bucket  mybucket contains the objects test.txt and test2.txt.  The
       current local directory has no files:

          aws s3 sync s3://mybucket .

       Output:

          download: s3://mybucket/test.txt to test.txt
          download: s3://mybucket/test2.txt to test2.txt

       The following sync command syncs objects under a specified  prefix  and
       bucket  to  files  in a local directory by uploading the local files to
       s3.  Because the --delete parameter flag is thrown, any files  existing
       under the specified prefix and bucket but not existing in the local di-
       rectory will be deleted.  In this example, the user  syncs  the  bucket
       mybucket  to  the local current directory.  The local current directory
       contains the files test.txt and test2.txt.  The  bucket  mybucket  con-
       tains the object test3.txt:

          aws s3 sync . s3://mybucket --delete

       Output:

          upload: test.txt to s3://mybucket/test.txt
          upload: test2.txt to s3://mybucket/test2.txt
          delete: s3://mybucket/test3.txt

       The  following  sync command syncs objects under a specified prefix and
       bucket to files in a local directory by uploading the  local  files  to
       s3.  Because the --exclude parameter flag is thrown, all files matching
       the pattern existing both in s3 and locally will be excluded  from  the
       sync.  In this example, the user syncs the bucket mybucket to the local
       current directory.  The local  current  directory  contains  the  files
       test.jpg  and  test2.txt.   The  bucket  mybucket  contains  the object
       test.jpg of a different size than the local test.jpg:

          aws s3 sync . s3://mybucket --exclude "*.jpg"

       Output:

          upload: test2.txt to s3://mybucket/test2.txt

       The following sync command syncs files under a local directory  to  ob-
       jects  under  a  specified prefix and bucket by downloading s3 objects.
       This example uses the --exclude parameter flag to exclude  a  specified
       directory  and  s3  prefix from the sync command.  In this example, the
       user syncs the local current directory to the bucket mybucket.  The lo-
       cal   current   directory   contains   the   files   test.txt  and  an-
       other/test2.txt.   The  bucket  mybucket  contains  the   objects   an-
       other/test5.txt and test1.txt:

          aws s3 sync s3://mybucket/ . --exclude "*another/*"

       Output:

          download: s3://mybucket/test1.txt to test1.txt

       The following sync command syncs files between two buckets in different
       regions:

          aws s3 sync s3://my-us-west-2-bucket s3://my-us-east-1-bucket --source-region us-west-2 --region us-east-1

       Sync to an S3 access point

       The following sync command syncs the current directory  to  the  access
       point (myaccesspoint):

          aws s3 sync . s3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/

       Output:

          upload: test.txt to s3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/test.txt
          upload: test2.txt to s3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/test2.txt



                                                                        SYNC()
