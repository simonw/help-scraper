LIST-ATTACKS()                                                  LIST-ATTACKS()



NAME
       list-attacks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns all ongoing DDoS attacks or all DDoS attacks during a specified
       time period.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-attacks is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: AttackSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-attacks
          [--resource-arns <value>]
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arns (list)
          The  ARNs  (Amazon  Resource  Names)  of the resources that were at-
          tacked. If you leave this blank, all applicable resources  for  this
          account will be included.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --start-time (structure)
          The  start  of  the time period for the attacks. This is a timestamp
          type. The request syntax listing for this call  indicates  a  number
          type,  but  you  can  provide the time in any valid timestamp format
          setting.

          FromInclusive -> (timestamp)
              The start time, in Unix time in seconds.

          ToExclusive -> (timestamp)
              The end time, in Unix time in seconds.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FromInclusive=timestamp,ToExclusive=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FromInclusive": timestamp,
            "ToExclusive": timestamp
          }

       --end-time (structure)
          The end of the time period for the  attacks.  This  is  a  timestamp
          type.  The  request  syntax listing for this call indicates a number
          type, but you can provide the time in  any  valid  timestamp  format
          setting.

          FromInclusive -> (timestamp)
              The start time, in Unix time in seconds.

          ToExclusive -> (timestamp)
              The end time, in Unix time in seconds.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FromInclusive=timestamp,ToExclusive=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FromInclusive": timestamp,
            "ToExclusive": timestamp
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve attack summaries from AWS Shield Advanced

       The  following  list-attacks example retrieves summaries of attacks for
       the specified AWS CloudFront distribution during the specified time pe-
       riod.  The response includes attack IDs that you can provide to the de-
       scribe-attack command for detailed information on an attack.

              --start-time FromInclusive=1529280000,ToExclusive=1529300000

       Output:

       NextToken -> (string)
          When you request a list of objects from Shield Advanced, if the  re-
          sponse  does  not  include  all  of the remaining available objects,
          Shield Advanced includes a NextToken value in the response. You  can
          retrieve  the next batch of objects by requesting the list again and
          providing the token that was returned by the prior call in your  re-
          quest.

          You  can indicate the maximum number of objects that you want Shield
          Advanced to return for a single call with  the  MaxResults  setting.
          Shield  Advanced  will  not return more than MaxResults objects, but
          may return fewer, even if more objects are still available.

          Whenever more objects remain that Shield Advanced has  not  yet  re-
          turned to you, the response will include a NextToken value.
