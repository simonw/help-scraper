NAME
       describe-protection -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the details of a  Protection object.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-protection
          [--protection-id <value>]
          [--resource-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --protection-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier  (ID) for the  Protection object that is de-
          scribed. When submitting the  DescribeProtection  request  you  must
          provide either the ResourceArn or the ProtectionID , but not both.

       --resource-arn (string)
          The  ARN  (Amazon Resource Name) of the Amazon Web Services resource
          for the  Protection object that is described.  When  submitting  the
          DescribeProtection  request  you must provide either the ResourceArn
          or the ProtectionID , but not both.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve the details for an AWS Shield Advanced protection

       The following describe-protection example displays  details  about  the
       Shield  Advanced  protection with the specified ID. You can obtain pro-
       tection IDs by running the list-protections command.

          aws shield describe-protection \
              --protection-id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

       Output:

          {
              "Protection": {
                  "Id": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "Name": "1.2.3.4",
                  "ResourceArn": "arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:eip-allocation/eipalloc-0ac1537af40742a6d"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       Protection -> (structure)
          The  Protection object that is described.

          Id -> (string)
              The unique identifier (ID) of the protection.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the protection. For example, My CloudFront distribu-
              tions .

          ResourceArn -> (string)
              The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the Amazon  Web  Services  re-
              source that is protected.

          HealthCheckIds -> (list)
              The  unique identifier (ID) for the Route 53 health check that's
              associated with the protection.

              (string)

          ProtectionArn -> (string)
              The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the protection.

          ApplicationLayerAutomaticResponseConfiguration -> (structure)
              The automatic application layer DDoS mitigation settings for the
              protection.  This  configuration  determines  whether Shield Ad-
              vanced automatically manages rules in the web ACL  in  order  to
              respond  to application layer events that Shield Advanced deter-
              mines to be DDoS attacks.

              Status -> (string)
                 Indicates whether automatic application layer DDoS mitigation
                 is enabled for the protection.

              Action -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the action setting that Shield Advanced should use
                 in the WAF rules that it creates on behalf of  the  protected
                 resource  in  response  to  DDoS attacks. You specify this as
                 part of the configuration for the automatic application layer
                 DDoS  mitigation feature, when you enable or update automatic
                 mitigation. Shield Advanced creates the WAF rules in a Shield
                 Advanced-managed rule group, inside the web ACL that you have
                 associated with the resource.

                 Block -> (structure)
                     Specifies that Shield Advanced should configure  its  WAF
                     rules with the WAF Block action.

                     You  must  specify  exactly  one  action, either Block or
                     Count .

                 Count -> (structure)
                     Specifies that Shield Advanced should configure  its  WAF
                     rules with the WAF Count action.

                     You  must  specify  exactly  one  action, either Block or
                     Count .
