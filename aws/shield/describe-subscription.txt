DESCRIBE-SUBSCRIPTION()                                DESCRIBE-SUBSCRIPTION()



NAME
       describe-subscription -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides details about the Shield Advanced subscription for an account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-subscription
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              The date and time your subscription will end.

          TimeCommitmentInSeconds -> (long)

              When you initally create a subscription, AutoRenew is set to EN-
              ABLED  . You can change this by submitting an UpdateSubscription
              request. If the UpdateSubscription request does not  included  a
              value  for  AutoRenew , the existing value for AutoRenew remains
              unchanged.

              If PENDING , you have requested proactive engagement and the re-
              quest  is  pending.  The status changes to ENABLED when your re-
              quest is fully processed.
