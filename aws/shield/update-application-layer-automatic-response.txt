SYNOPSIS
            update-application-layer-automatic-response
          --resource-arn <value>
          --action <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the resource.

       --action (structure)
          Specifies the action setting that Shield Advanced should use in  the
          WAF rules that it creates on behalf of the protected resource in re-
          sponse to DDoS attacks. You specify this as part of  the  configura-
          tion  for  the  automatic application layer DDoS mitigation feature,
          when you enable or update automatic mitigation. Shield Advanced cre-
          ates  the  WAF rules in a Shield Advanced-managed rule group, inside
          the web ACL that you have associated with the resource.

          Block -> (structure)
              Specifies that Shield Advanced should configure  its  WAF  rules
              with the WAF Block action.

              You must specify exactly one action, either Block or Count .

          Count -> (structure)
              Specifies  that  Shield  Advanced should configure its WAF rules
              with the WAF Count action.

              You must specify exactly one action, either Block or Count .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Block={},Count={}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Block": {

            },
            "Count": {

            }
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
