NAME
       disassociate-drt-log-bucket -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes the Shield Response Team's (SRT) access to the specified Amazon
       S3 bucket containing the logs that you shared previously.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-drt-log-bucket
          --log-bucket <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --log-bucket (string)
          The Amazon S3 bucket that contains the logs that you want to share.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To remove the authorization for DRT to access an Amazon  S3  bucket  on
       your behalf

       The  following disassociate-drt-log-bucket example removes the associa-
       tion between the DRT and the specified S3 bucket.  After  this  command
       completes, the DRT can no longer access the bucket on behalf of the ac-
       count.

          aws shield disassociate-drt-log-bucket \
