NAME
       describe-slot-type -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets metadata information about a slot type.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-slot-type
          --slot-type-id <value>
          --bot-id <value>
          --bot-version <value>
          --locale-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --slot-type-id (string)
          The identifier of the slot type.

       --bot-id (string)
          The identifier of the bot associated with the slot type.

       --bot-version (string)
          The version of the bot associated with the slot type.

       --locale-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the language and locale of the slot type to de-
          scribe. The string must match one of the supported locales. For more
          information, see Supported languages .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       slotTypeId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the slot type.

       slotTypeName -> (string)
          The name specified for the slot type.

       description -> (string)
          The description specified for the slot type.

       slotTypeValues -> (list)
          The values that the slot type can take. Includes  any  synonyms  for
          the slot type values.

          (structure)
              Each slot type can have a set of values. Each SlotTypeValue rep-
              resents a value that the slot type can take.

              sampleValue -> (structure)
                 The value of the slot type entry.

                 value -> (string)
                     The value that can be used for a slot type.

              synonyms -> (list)
                 Additional values related to the slot type entry.

                 (structure)
                     Defines one of the values for a slot type.

                     value -> (string)
                        The value that can be used for a slot type.

       valueSelectionSetting -> (structure)
          The strategy that Amazon Lex uses to choose a value from a  list  of
          possible values.

          resolutionStrategy -> (string)
              Determines  the slot resolution strategy that Amazon Lex uses to
              return slot type values. The field can be set to one of the fol-
              lowing values:

              o OriginalValue  - Returns the value entered by the user, if the
                user value is similar to the slot value.

              o TopResolution - If there is a resolution list  for  the  slot,
                return the first value in the resolution list as the slot type
                value. If there is no resolution list, null is returned.

              If you don't specify the valueSelectionStrategy, the default  is
              OriginalValue.

          regexFilter -> (structure)
              A regular expression used to validate the value of a slot.

              pattern -> (string)
                 A regular expression used to validate the value of a slot.

                 Use  a  standard  regular expression. Amazon Lex supports the
                 following characters in the regular expression:

                 o A-Z, a-z

                 o 0-9

                 o Unicode characters ("u<Unicode>")

                 Represent Unicode characters with four  digits,  for  example
                 "u0041" or "u005A".

                 The following regular expression operators are not supported:

                 o Infinite repeaters:
                   *
                   , +, or {x,} with no upper bound.

                 System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 259)
                   Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

                 o Wild card (.)

          advancedRecognitionSetting -> (structure)
              Provides  settings that enable advanced recognition settings for
              slot values.

              audioRecognitionStrategy -> (string)
                 Enables using the slot values as a custom vocabulary for rec-
                 ognizing user utterances.

       parentSlotTypeSignature -> (string)
          The built in slot type used as a parent to this slot type.

       botId -> (string)
          The identifier of the bot associated with the slot type.

       botVersion -> (string)
          The version of the bot associated with the slot type.

       localeId -> (string)
          The language and locale specified for the slot type.

       creationDateTime -> (timestamp)
          A timestamp of the date and time that the slot type was created.

       lastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
          A  timestamp  of  the  date and time that the slot type was last up-
          dated.

          definition.

          grammarSlotTypeSetting -> (structure)
              Settings  required  for  a slot type based on a grammar that you
              provide.

              source -> (structure)
