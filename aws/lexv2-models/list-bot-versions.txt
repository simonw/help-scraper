LIST-BOT-VERSIONS()                                        LIST-BOT-VERSIONS()



NAME
       list-bot-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about all of the versions of a bot.

       The  ListBotVersions  operation  returns a summary of each version of a
       bot. For example, if a bot has three numbered versions, the ListBotVer-
       sions  operation  returns  for summaries, one for each numbered version
       and one for the DRAFT version.

       The ListBotVersions operation always returns at least one version,  the
       DRAFT version.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-bot-versions
          --bot-id <value>
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bot-id (string)
          The identifier of the bot to list versions for.

       --sort-by (structure)
          Specifies sorting parameters for the list of versions. You can spec-
          ify that the list be sorted by version name in either  ascending  or
          descending order.

          attribute -> (string)
              The attribute to use to sort the list of versions.

          order -> (string)
              The  order  to  sort  the list. You can specify ascending or de-
              scending order.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attribute=string,order=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attribute": "BotVersion",
            "order": "Ascending"|"Descending"
          }

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of versions to return in each page of results. If
          there are fewer results than the max page size, only the actual num-
          ber of results are returned.

       --next-token (string)
          If the response to the ListBotVersion operation  contains  more  re-
          sults  than  specified  in  the maxResults parameter, a token is re-
          turned in the response. Use that token in the nextToken parameter to
          return the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       botId -> (string)
          The identifier of the bot to list versions for.

       botVersionSummaries -> (list)
          Summary information for the bot versions that meet the filter crite-
          ria specified in the request. The length of the list is specified in
          the maxResults parameter of the request. If there are more  versions
          available, the nextToken field contains a token to get the next page
          of results.

          (structure)
              Summary  information  about  a  bot  version  returned  by   the
              ListBotVersions operation.

              botName -> (string)
                 The name of the bot associated with the version.

              botVersion -> (string)
                 The  numeric  version  of  the bot, or DRAFT to indicate that
                 this is the version of the bot that can be updated..

              description -> (string)
                 The description of the version.

              botStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the bot. When the status is available, the ver-
                 sion of the bot is ready for use.

              creationDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  timestamp  of  the date and time that the version was cre-
                 ated.

       nextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates whether there are more results to return in a
          response to the ListBotVersions operation. If the nextToken field is
          present, you send the contents as the nextToken parameter of a List-
          BotAliases operation request to get the next page of results.
