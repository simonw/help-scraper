DESCRIBE-IMPORT()                                            DESCRIBE-IMPORT()



NAME
       describe-import -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about a specific import.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-import
          --import-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --import-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the import to describe.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          The unique identifier of the described import.

       resourceSpecification -> (structure)
          The specifications of the imported bot, bot locale, or custom vocab-
          ulary.

          botImportSpecification -> (structure)
              Parameters for importing a bot.

              botName -> (string)

                 By  default, data stored by Amazon Lex is encrypted. The Dat-
                 aPrivacy structure provides settings that determine how  Ama-
                 zon  Lex  handles special cases of securing the data for your
                 bot.

                 childDirected -> (boolean)
                     For each Amazon Lex bot created with the Amazon Lex Model
                     Building  Service,  you  must specify whether your use of
                     Amazon Lex is related to a website, program, or other ap-
                     plication  that  is  directed or targeted, in whole or in
                     part, to children under age 13 and subject to  the  Chil-
                     dren's  Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by specify-
                     ing true or false in the childDirected field. By specify-
                     ing  true  in  the  childDirected field, you confirm that
                     your use of Amazon Lex is related to a website,  program,
                     or  other  application  that  is directed or targeted, in
                     whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to
                     COPPA.  By  specifying  false in the childDirected field,
                     you confirm that your use of Amazon Lex is not related to
                     a website, program, or other application that is directed
                     or targeted, in whole or in part, to children  under  age
                     13  and  subject  to COPPA. You may not specify a default
                     value for the childDirected field  that  does  not  accu-
                     rately  reflect whether your use of Amazon Lex is related
                     to a website, program, or other application that  is  di-
                     rected  or targeted, in whole or in part, to children un-
                     der age 13 and subject to COPPA. If your  use  of  Amazon
                     Lex  relates  to a website, program, or other application
                     that is directed in whole or in part, to  children  under
                     age  13, you must obtain any required verifiable parental
                     consent under COPPA. For information regarding the use of
                     Amazon  Lex  in  connection  with  websites, programs, or
                     other applications that  are  directed  or  targeted,  in
                     whole  or  in  part,  to  children  under age 13, see the
                     Amazon Lex FAQ .

              idleSessionTTLInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The time, in seconds, that Amazon Lex should keep information
                 about a user's conversation with the bot.

                 A  user  interaction  remains  active  for the amount of time
                 specified. If no conversation occurs during  this  time,  the
                 session  expires and Amazon Lex deletes any data provided be-
                 fore the timeout.

                 You can specify between 60 (1 minute) and 86,400  (24  hours)
                 seconds.

              botTags -> (map)
                 A  list of tags to add to the bot. You can only add tags when
                 you import a bot. You can't use the  UpdateBot  operation  to
                 update tags. To update tags, use the TagResource operation.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              testBotAliasTags -> (map)
                 A  list  of  tags to add to the test alias for a bot. You can
                 only add tags when you import a bot. You can't  use  the  Up-
                 dateAlias  operation  to  update  tags. To update tags on the
                 test alias, use the TagResource operation.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

          botLocaleImportSpecification -> (structure)
              Parameters for importing a bot locale.

              botId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the bot to import the locale to.

              botVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the bot to import the locale to. This can only
                 be the DRAFT version of the bot.

              localeId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  of the language and locale that the bot will
                 be used in. The string must match one of  the  supported  lo-
                 cales.  All of the intents, slot types, and slots used in the
                 bot must have the same  locale.  For  more  information,  see
                 Supported languages .

              nluIntentConfidenceThreshold -> (double)
                 Determines  the  threshold  where  Amazon Lex will insert the
                 AMAZON.FallbackIntent , AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent ,  or  both
                 when returning alternative intents. AMAZON.FallbackIntent and
                 AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent are only inserted if they are  con-
                 figured for the bot.

                 For  example, suppose a bot is configured with the confidence
                 threshold of 0.80 and the AMAZON.FallbackIntent . Amazon  Lex
                 returns  three  alternative intents with the following confi-
                 dence scores: IntentA (0.70), IntentB (0.60), IntentC (0.50).
                 The response from the PostText operation would be:

                 o AMAZON.FallbackIntent

                 o IntentA

                 o IntentB

                 o IntentC

              voiceSettings -> (structure)
                 Defines  settings for using an Amazon Polly voice to communi-
                 cate with a user.

                 voiceId -> (string)
                     The identifier of the Amazon Polly voice to use.

                 engine -> (string)
                     Indicates the type of Amazon Polly voice that Amazon  Lex
                     should  use for voice interaction with the user. For more
                     information, see the ` engine parameter  of  the  Synthe-
