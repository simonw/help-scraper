OPTIONS
       --slot-type-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the slot type to update.

       --slot-type-name (string)
          The new name of the slot type.

              resents a value that the slot type can take.

              sampleValue -> (structure)

                 value -> (string)
                     The value that can be used for a slot type.

              synonyms -> (list)
                 Additional values related to the slot type entry.

                 (structure)
                     Defines one of the values for a slot type.

                     value -> (string)
                        The value that can be used for a slot type.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          sampleValue={value=string},synonyms=[{value=string},{value=string}] ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "sampleValue": {
                "value": "string"
              },
              "synonyms": [
                {
                  "value": "string"
                }
                ...
              ]
            }

          ]

       --value-selection-setting (structure)
          The  strategy  that  Amazon  Lex should use when deciding on a value
          from the list of slot type values.

          resolutionStrategy -> (string)
              Determines the slot resolution strategy that Amazon Lex uses  to
              return slot type values. The field can be set to one of the fol-
              lowing values:

              o OriginalValue - Returns the value entered by the user, if  the
                user value is similar to the slot value.

              o TopResolution  -  If  there is a resolution list for the slot,
                return the first value in the resolution list as the slot type
                value. If there is no resolution list, null is returned.

              If  you don't specify the valueSelectionStrategy, the default is
              OriginalValue.

          regexFilter -> (structure)
              A regular expression used to validate the value of a slot.

              pattern -> (string)
                 A regular expression used to validate the value of a slot.

                 Use a standard regular expression. Amazon  Lex  supports  the

                 o A-Z, a-z

                 o 0-9

                 o Unicode characters ("u<Unicode>")

                 Represent  Unicode  characters  with four digits, for example
                 "u0041" or "u005A".

                 The following regular expression operators are not supported:

                 o Infinite repeaters:
                   *
                   , +, or {x,} with no upper bound.

                 System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 236)

                 o Wild card (.)

          advancedRecognitionSetting -> (structure)

          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
