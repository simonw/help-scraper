CREATE-RESOURCE-POLICY-STATEMENT()          CREATE-RESOURCE-POLICY-STATEMENT()



NAME
       create-resource-policy-statement -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  a  new  resource policy statement to a bot or bot alias. If a re-
       source policy exists, the statement is added to  the  current  resource
       policy. If a policy doesn't exist, a new policy is created.

       You  can't create a resource policy statement that allows cross-account
       access.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          --effect <value>
          --principal <value>
          --action <value>

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the bot or bot alias that the  re-
          source policy is attached to.

       --statement-id (string)
          The  name  of the statement. The ID is the same as the Sid IAM prop-
          erty. The statement name must be unique within the policy. For  more
          information, see IAM JSON policy elements: Sid .

       --effect (string)
          Determines  whether the statement allows or denies access to the re-
          source.

          Possible values:

          o Allow

          o Deny

       --principal (list)
          An IAM principal, such as an IAM users, IAM roles, or  AWS  services
          that  is  allowed  or denied access to a resource. For more informa-
          tion, see AWS JSON policy elements: Principal .

          (structure)
              The IAM principal that you allowing or denying access to an Ama-
              zon  Lex  action. You must provide a service or an arn , but not
              both in the same statement. For more information, see  AWS  JSON
              policy elements: Principal .

              service -> (string)
                 The name of the AWS service that should allowed or denied ac-
                 cess to an Amazon Lex action.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the principal.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          service=string,arn=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "service": "string",
              "arn": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --action (list)
          The Amazon Lex action that this policy either allows or denies.  The
          action  must  apply  to  the resource type of the specified ARN. For
          more information, see Actions, resources,  and  condition  keys  for
          Amazon Lex V2 .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --condition (map)
          Specifies a condition when the policy is in effect. If the principal
          of the policy is a service principal, you must provide two condition
          blocks, one with a SourceAccount global condition key and one with a
          SourceArn global condition key.

          For more information, see IAM JSON policy elements: Condition .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (map)
              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string,KeyName2=KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {"string": "string"
                ...}
            ...}

       --expected-revision-id (string)
          The identifier of the revision of the policy to edit. If this  revi-
          sion  ID doesn't match the current revision ID, Amazon Lex throws an
          exception.

          If you don't specify a revision, Amazon Lex overwrites the  contents
          of the policy with the new values.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       resourceArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the bot or bot alias that the re-
          source policy is attached to.

       revisionId -> (string)
          The current revision of the resource policy. Use the revision ID  to
          make  sure  that  you are updating the most current version of a re-
          source policy when you add a policy statement to a resource,  delete
          a resource, or update a resource.
