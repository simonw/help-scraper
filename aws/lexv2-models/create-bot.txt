       Shorthand Syntax:

          childDirected=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "childDirected": true|false
          }

       --idle-session-ttl-in-seconds (integer)
          The  time, in seconds, that Amazon Lex should keep information about
          a user's conversation with the bot.

          A user interaction remains active for the amount of time  specified.
          If  no conversation occurs during this time, the session expires and
          Amazon Lex deletes any data provided before the timeout.

          You can specify between 60 (1 minute) and 86,400 (24 hours) seconds.

       --bot-tags (map)
          A list of tags to add to the bot. You can only  add  tags  when  you
          create  a bot. You can't use the UpdateBot operation to update tags.
          To update tags, use the TagResource operation.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --test-bot-alias-tags (map)
          A list of tags to add to the test alias for a bot. You can only  add
          tags  when you create a bot. You can't use the UpdateAlias operation
          to update tags. To update tags on the test  alias,  use  the  TagRe-
          source operation.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
