NAME
       describe-intent -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns metadata about an intent.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-intent
          --intent-id <value>
          --bot-id <value>
          --bot-version <value>
          --locale-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --intent-id (string)
          The identifier of the intent to describe.

       --bot-id (string)
          The identifier of the bot associated with the intent.

       --bot-version (string)
          The version of the bot associated with the intent.

       --locale-id (string)
          The identifier of the language and locale of the intent to describe.
          The string must match one of the supported locales. For more  infor-
          mation, see Supported languages .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                                      by the platform that displays  the  but-

                                      rangement of the buttons  is  determined
                                      by  the  platform that displays the but-

                                             what value is returned when  they
                                             choose this button.

              have a yes or no answer.

              Amazon Lex uses this prompt to ensure that the user acknowledges
              that  the intent is ready for fulfillment. For example, with the
              OrderPizza intent, you might want to confirm that the  order  is
              correct  before  placing  it. For other intents, such as intents
              that simply respond to user questions, you might not need to ask

                                      turned when they choose this button.
