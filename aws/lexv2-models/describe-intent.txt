OPTIONS
       --intent-id (string)
          The identifier of the intent to describe.

       --bot-id (string)
          The identifier of the bot associated with the intent.

       --bot-version (string)
          The version of the bot associated with the intent.

       --locale-id (string)
          The identifier of the language and locale of the intent to describe.
          The string must match one of the supported locales. For more  infor-
          mation, see Supported languages .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,

                        tent.  The  name  of the slot maps to the value of the
                        slot. Slots that are not included in  the  map  aren't
                        overridden.

                               When the shape value is  List  ,  it  indicates
                               that  the  values field contains a list of slot
                               values. When the value is Scalar , it indicates
                               that the value field contains a single value.

                                   the bot. You can choose to  use  the  value
                                   entered by the user, or you can have Amazon
                                   Lex choose the first value in the resolved-
                                   Values list.

                            values -> (list)
                               A list of one or more values that the user pro-
                               vided for the slot. For  example,  for  a  slot
                               that  elicits  pizza toppings, the values might
                               be "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                      When  the shape value is List , it indi-
                                      cates that the values field  contains  a
                                      list  of  slot values. When the value is
                                      Scalar , it  indicates  that  the  value

                                          for the slot. The actual  value  de-
                                          pends  on  the  setting of the value
                                          selection strategy for the bot.  You
                                          can  choose to use the value entered
                                          by the user, or you can have  Amazon
                                          Lex  choose  the  first value in the
                                          resolvedValues list.

                                   values -> (list)

                                             mines for the  slot.  The  actual
                                             value  depends  on the setting of
                                             the value selection strategy  for
                                             the  bot.  You  can choose to use

                                          pizza toppings, the values might  be
                                          "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                             shape -> (string)
                                                 When  the shape value is List
                                                 , it indicates that the  val-
                                                 ues  field contains a list of
                                                 slot values. When  the  value
                                                 is Scalar , it indicates that
                                                 the value  field  contains  a

                                                    The actual  value  depends
                                                    on   the  setting  of  the

                                                    for   the   bot.  You  can
                                                    choose to  use  the  value
                                                    entered  by  the  user, or
                                                    you can  have  Amazon  Lex
                                                    choose  the first value in

                                      When the shape value is List , it  indi-
                                      cates  that  the values field contains a
                                      list of slot values. When the  value  is
                                      Scalar  ,  it  indicates  that the value
                                      field contains a single value.

                                          for  the  slot. The actual value de-
                                          pends on the setting  of  the  value
                                          selection  strategy for the bot. You
                                          can choose to use the value  entered
                                          by  the user, or you can have Amazon
                                          Lex choose the first  value  in  the
                                          resolvedValues list.

                                      user provided for the slot. For example,
                                      for  a slot that elicits pizza toppings,
                                      the  values  might  be  "pepperoni"  and
                                      "pineapple."

                                          step.

                                          shape -> (string)
                                             When the shape value is List , it
                                             indicates that the  values  field
                                             contains  a  list of slot values.
                                             When the value is Scalar , it in-
                                             dicates that the value field con-
                                             tains a single value.

                                          value -> (structure)

                                                 termines  for  the  slot. The
                                                 actual value depends  on  the
                                                 setting  of  the value selec-
                                                 tion strategy  for  the  bot.
                                                 You  can  choose  to  use the
                                                 value entered by the user, or
                                                 you   can   have  Amazon  Lex
                                                 choose the first value in the

                                             For  example,  for  a  slot  that
                                             elicits pizza toppings, the  val-
                                             ues   might  be  "pepperoni"  and

                               that  elicits  pizza toppings, the values might
                               be "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                               (structure)
                                   The slot values that Amazon Lex  uses  when
                                   it sets slot values in a dialog step.

                                   shape -> (string)
                                      When  the shape value is List , it indi-
                                      cates that the values field  contains  a
                                      list  of  slot values. When the value is
                                      Scalar , it  indicates  that  the  value
                                      field contains a single value.

                                   value -> (structure)

                                          for the slot. The actual  value  de-
                                          pends  on  the  setting of the value
                                          selection strategy for the bot.  You
                                          can  choose to use the value entered
                                          by the user, or you can have  Amazon
                                          Lex  choose  the  first value in the
                                          resolvedValues list.

                                   values -> (list)

                                      user provided for the slot. For example,
                                      for a slot that elicits pizza  toppings,
                                      the  values  might  be  "pepperoni"  and
                                      "pineapple."

                                   A map of all of the  slot  value  overrides
                                   for  the  intent. The name of the slot maps
                                   to the value of the slot.  Slots  that  are
                                   not included in the map aren't overridden.

                                   key -> (string)

                                   value -> (structure)

                                      step.

                                      shape -> (string)
                                          When  the  shape  value is List , it
                                          indicates that the values field con-
                                          tains  a  list  of slot values. When
                                          the value is Scalar ,  it  indicates
                                          that the value field contains a sin-
                                          gle value.

                                      value -> (structure)

                                             mines  for  the  slot. The actual
                                             value depends on the  setting  of
                                             the  value selection strategy for
                                             the bot. You can  choose  to  use
                                             the value entered by the user, or
                                             you can have  Amazon  Lex  choose
                                             the  first value in the resolved-
                                             Values list.

                                      values -> (list)

                                          the  user provided for the slot. For
                                          example, for  a  slot  that  elicits
                                          pizza  toppings, the values might be
                                          "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                          (structure)

                                             uses  when it sets slot values in
                                             a dialog step.

                                             shape -> (string)
                                                 When the shape value is  List
                                                 ,  it indicates that the val-
                                                 ues field contains a list  of
                                                 slot  values.  When the value
                                                 is Scalar , it indicates that
                                                 the  value  field  contains a
                                                 single value.

                                                 slot.

                                                 interpretedValue -> (string)
                                                    The  value that Amazon Lex
                                                    determines for  the  slot.
                                                    The  actual  value depends
                                                    on  the  setting  of   the
                                                    value  selection  strategy
                                                    for  the  bot.   You   can
                                                    choose  to  use  the value
                                                    entered by  the  user,  or
                                                    you  can  have  Amazon Lex
                                                    choose the first value  in
                                                    the resolvedValues list.

                                                 the  slot. For example, for a
                                                 slot that elicits pizza  top-
                                                 pings,  the  values  might be

                                      When  the shape value is List , it indi-
                                      cates that the values field  contains  a
                                      list  of  slot values. When the value is
                                      Scalar , it  indicates  that  the  value
                                      field contains a single value.

                                          for the slot. The actual  value  de-
                                          pends  on  the  setting of the value
                                          selection strategy for the bot.  You
                                          can  choose to use the value entered
                                          by the user, or you can have  Amazon
                                          Lex  choose  the  first value in the
                                          resolvedValues list.

                                      the  values  might  be  "pepperoni"  and
                                      "pineapple."

                                          shape -> (string)
                                             When the shape value is List , it

                                             contains a list of  slot  values.
                                             When the value is Scalar , it in-
                                             dicates that the value field con-
                                             tains a single value.

                                                 actual  value  depends on the

                                                 You can  choose  to  use  the
                                                 value entered by the user, or
                                                 you  can  have   Amazon   Lex

                        tent.  The  name  of the slot maps to the value of the
                        slot. Slots that are not included in  the  map  aren't
                        overridden.

                               When the shape value is  List  ,  it  indicates
                               that  the  values field contains a list of slot
                               values. When the value is Scalar , it indicates
                               that the value field contains a single value.

                                   the bot. You can choose to  use  the  value
                                   entered by the user, or you can have Amazon
                                   Lex choose the first value in the resolved-
                                   Values list.

                            values -> (list)
                               A list of one or more values that the user pro-
                               vided for the slot. For  example,  for  a  slot
                               that  elicits  pizza toppings, the values might
                               be "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                      When  the shape value is List , it indi-
                                      cates that the values field  contains  a
                                      list  of  slot values. When the value is
                                      Scalar , it  indicates  that  the  value
                                      field contains a single value.

                                   value -> (structure)
                                      The current value of the slot.

                                          for the slot. The actual  value  de-
                                          pends  on  the  setting of the value
                                          selection strategy for the bot.  You
                                          can  choose to use the value entered
                                          by the user, or you can have  Amazon
                                          Lex  choose  the  first value in the
                                          resolvedValues list.

                                   values -> (list)

                                      user provided for the slot. For example,
                                      for a slot that elicits pizza  toppings,
                                      the  values  might  be  "pepperoni"  and
                                      "pineapple."

                                          tains a list of  slot  values.  When
                                          the  value  is Scalar , it indicates
                                          that the value field contains a sin-
                                          gle value.

                                      value -> (structure)

                                                 , it indicates that the  val-
                                                 ues  field contains a list of
                                                 slot values. When  the  value
                                                 is Scalar , it indicates that
                                                 the value  field  contains  a

                                                    The actual  value  depends
                                                    on   the  setting  of  the

                                                    entered  by  the  user, or
                                                    you can  have  Amazon  Lex
                                                    choose  the first value in

                                      When the shape value is List , it  indi-
                                      cates  that  the values field contains a
                                      list of slot values. When the  value  is
                                      Scalar  ,  it  indicates  that the value
                                      field contains a single value.

                                          for  the  slot. The actual value de-
                                          pends on the setting  of  the  value
                                          selection  strategy for the bot. You
                                          can choose to use the value  entered
                                          by  the user, or you can have Amazon
                                          Lex choose the first  value  in  the
                                          resolvedValues list.

                                      user provided for the slot. For example,
                                      for  a slot that elicits pizza toppings,
                                      the  values  might  be  "pepperoni"  and
                                      "pineapple."

                                          step.

                                          shape -> (string)
                                             When the shape value is List , it
                                             indicates that the  values  field
                                             contains  a  list of slot values.
                                             When the value is Scalar , it in-
                                             dicates that the value field con-
                                             tains a single value.

                                          value -> (structure)

                                                 termines  for  the  slot. The
                                                 actual value depends  on  the
                                                 setting  of  the value selec-
                                                 tion strategy  for  the  bot.
                                                 You  can  choose  to  use the
                                                 value entered by the user, or
                                                 you   can   have  Amazon  Lex
                                                 choose the first value in the

                                             For  example,  for  a  slot  that
                                             elicits pizza toppings, the  val-
                                             ues   might  be  "pepperoni"  and

                                      displaying  the response card has access
                                      to the image.

                                      rangement of the buttons  is  determined
                                      by  the  platform that displays the but-
                                      ton.

                                             what value is returned when  they
                                             choose this button.

                                          value -> (string)

                                             values configured for the slot.

                 allowInterrupt -> (boolean)

              Amazon Lex uses this prompt to ensure that the user acknowledges
              that the intent is ready for fulfillment. For example, with  the
              OrderPizza  intent,  you might want to confirm that the order is
              correct before placing it. For other intents,  such  as  intents
              that simply respond to user questions, you might not need to ask
              the user for confirmation before providing the information.

                            the  slot.  Slots that are not included in the map
                            aren't overridden.

                            key -> (string)

                            value -> (structure)
                               The slot values that Amazon Lex  uses  when  it
                               sets slot values in a dialog step.

                               shape -> (string)

                                   that the values field contains  a  list  of
                                   slot  values. When the value is Scalar , it
                                   indicates that the value field  contains  a
                                   single value.

                               value -> (structure)

                                   interpretedValue -> (string)
                                      The value that Amazon Lex determines for
                                      the slot. The actual  value  depends  on
                                      the   setting  of  the  value  selection
                                      strategy for the bot. You can choose  to
                                      use  the  value  entered by the user, or
                                      you can have Amazon Lex choose the first
                                      value in the resolvedValues list.

                               values -> (list)

                                   provided for the slot. For example,  for  a
                                   slot  that elicits pizza toppings, the val-
                                   ues might be "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                   (structure)
                                      The slot values  that  Amazon  Lex  uses
                                      when  it  sets  slot  values in a dialog
                                      step.

                                      shape -> (string)
                                          When the shape value is  List  ,  it
                                          indicates that the values field con-
                                          tains a list of  slot  values.  When
                                          the  value  is Scalar , it indicates
                                          that the value field contains a sin-
                                          gle value.

                                      value -> (structure)

                                             mines for the  slot.  The  actual
                                             value  depends  on the setting of
                                             the value selection strategy  for
                                             the  bot.  You  can choose to use
                                             the value entered by the user, or
                                             you  can  have  Amazon Lex choose
                                             the first value in the  resolved-
                                             Values list.

                                          the user provided for the slot.  For
                                          example,  for  a  slot  that elicits
                                          pizza toppings, the values might  be
                                          "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                             displays the button.

                                             (structure)

                                                    chooses  this button. This
                                                    must be one  of  the  slot
                                                    values  configured for the

                            intent. The name of the slot maps to the value  of
                            the  slot.  Slots that are not included in the map
                            aren't overridden.

                                   that the values field contains  a  list  of
                                   slot  values. When the value is Scalar , it
                                   indicates that the value field  contains  a
                                   single value.

                               value -> (structure)

                                      The value that Amazon Lex determines for
                                      the slot. The actual  value  depends  on
                                      the   setting  of  the  value  selection
                                      strategy for the bot. You can choose  to
                                      use  the  value  entered by the user, or
                                      you can have Amazon Lex choose the first
                                      value in the resolvedValues list.

                               values -> (list)

                                   provided for the slot. For example,  for  a
                                   slot  that elicits pizza toppings, the val-
                                   ues might be "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                   (structure)
                                      The slot values  that  Amazon  Lex  uses
                                      when  it  sets  slot  values in a dialog
                                      step.

                                      shape -> (string)
                                          When the shape value is  List  ,  it
                                          indicates that the values field con-
                                          tains a list of  slot  values.  When
                                          the  value  is Scalar , it indicates
                                          that the value field contains a sin-
                                          gle value.

                                      value -> (structure)

                                             mines for the  slot.  The  actual
                                             value  depends  on the setting of
                                             the value selection strategy  for
                                             the  bot.  You  can choose to use
                                             the value entered by the user, or
                                             you  can  have  Amazon Lex choose
                                             the first value in the  resolved-
                                             Values list.

                                          the user provided for the slot.  For
                                          example,  for  a  slot  that elicits
                                          pizza toppings, the values might  be
                                          "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                      rangement of the buttons  is  determined
                                      by  the  platform that displays the but-
                                      ton.

                                             what value is returned when  they
                                             choose this button.

                                   provided for the slot. For example,  for  a
                                   slot  that elicits pizza toppings, the val-
                                   ues might be "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                   (structure)
                                      The slot values  that  Amazon  Lex  uses
                                      when  it  sets  slot  values in a dialog
                                      step.

                                      shape -> (string)
                                          When the shape value is  List  ,  it
                                          indicates that the values field con-
                                          tains a list of  slot  values.  When
                                          the  value  is Scalar , it indicates
                                          that the value field contains a sin-
                                          gle value.

                                      value -> (structure)

                                             The  value that Amazon Lex deter-
                                             mines for the  slot.  The  actual
                                             value  depends  on the setting of
                                             the value selection strategy  for
                                             the  bot.  You  can choose to use
                                             the value entered by the user, or
                                             you  can  have  Amazon Lex choose
                                             the first value in the  resolved-
                                             Values list.

                                          the user provided for the slot.  For
                                          example,  for  a  slot  that elicits
                                          pizza toppings, the values might  be
                                          "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                      The value that Amazon Lex determines for
                                      the slot. The actual  value  depends  on
                                      the   setting  of  the  value  selection
                                      strategy for the bot. You can choose  to
                                      use  the  value  entered by the user, or
                                      you can have Amazon Lex choose the first
                                      value in the resolvedValues list.

                               values -> (list)

                                   provided for the slot. For example,  for  a
                                   slot  that elicits pizza toppings, the val-
                                   ues might be "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                   (structure)
                                      The slot values  that  Amazon  Lex  uses
                                      when  it  sets  slot  values in a dialog
                                      step.

                                      shape -> (string)
                                          When the shape value is  List  ,  it
                                          indicates that the values field con-
                                          tains a list of  slot  values.  When
                                          the  value  is Scalar , it indicates
                                          that the value field contains a sin-
                                          gle value.

                                      value -> (structure)

                                             mines for the  slot.  The  actual
                                             value  depends  on the setting of
                                             the value selection strategy  for
                                             the  bot.  You  can choose to use
                                             the value entered by the user, or
                                             you  can  have  Amazon Lex choose
                                             the first value in the  resolved-

                                   A map of all of the  slot  value  overrides
                                   for  the  intent. The name of the slot maps
                                   to the value of the slot.  Slots  that  are
                                   not included in the map aren't overridden.

                                   key -> (string)

                                      step.

                                      shape -> (string)
                                          When  the  shape  value is List , it
                                          indicates that the values field con-
                                          tains  a  list  of slot values. When
                                          the value is Scalar ,  it  indicates
                                          that the value field contains a sin-
                                          gle value.

                                             mines  for  the  slot. The actual
                                             value depends on the  setting  of
                                             the  value selection strategy for
                                             the bot. You can  choose  to  use
                                             the value entered by the user, or
                                             you can have  Amazon  Lex  choose
                                             the  first value in the resolved-
                                             Values list.

                                      values -> (list)

                                          the  user provided for the slot. For
                                          example, for  a  slot  that  elicits
                                          pizza  toppings, the values might be
                                          "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                          (structure)

                                             a dialog step.

                                             shape -> (string)
                                                 When the shape value is  List
                                                 ,  it indicates that the val-
                                                 ues field contains a list  of
                                                 slot  values.  When the value
                                                 is Scalar , it indicates that
                                                 the  value  field  contains a
                                                 single value.

                                                 slot.

                                                 interpretedValue -> (string)
                                                    The  value that Amazon Lex
                                                    determines for  the  slot.
                                                    The  actual  value depends
                                                    on  the  setting  of   the
                                                    value  selection  strategy
                                                    for  the  bot.   You   can
                                                    choose  to  use  the value
                                                    entered by  the  user,  or
                                                    you  can  have  Amazon Lex
                                                    choose the first value  in
                                                    the resolvedValues list.

                                                 the  slot. For example, for a
                                                 slot that elicits pizza  top-
                                                 pings,  the  values  might be

                                          indicates that the values field con-
                                          tains  a  list  of slot values. When

                                             value depends on the  setting  of
                                             the  value selection strategy for

                                          shape -> (string)
                                             When the shape value is List , it
                                             indicates that the  values  field
                                             contains  a  list of slot values.

                                                        The  value that Amazon
                                                        Lex determines for the
                                                        slot. The actual value
                                                        depends on the setting

                                   to the value of the slot.  Slots  that  are
                                   not included in the map aren't overridden.

                                      shape -> (string)
                                          When  the  shape  value is List , it
                                          indicates that the values field con-
                                          tains  a  list  of slot values. When
                                          the value is Scalar ,  it  indicates
                                          that the value field contains a sin-
                                          gle value.

                                             mines  for  the  slot. The actual
                                             value depends on the  setting  of
                                             the  value selection strategy for
                                             the bot. You can  choose  to  use
                                             the value entered by the user, or
                                             you can have  Amazon  Lex  choose
                                             the  first value in the resolved-
                                             Values list.

                                      values -> (list)

                                          the  user provided for the slot. For
                                          example, for  a  slot  that  elicits
                                          pizza  toppings, the values might be
                                          "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                          (structure)

                                             a dialog step.

                                             shape -> (string)
                                                 When the shape value is  List
                                                 ,  it indicates that the val-
                                                 ues field contains a list  of
                                                 slot  values.  When the value
                                                 is Scalar , it indicates that
                                                 the  value  field  contains a
                                                 single value.

                                                 interpretedValue -> (string)
                                                    The  value that Amazon Lex
                                                    determines for  the  slot.
                                                    The  actual  value depends
                                                    on  the  setting  of   the
                                                    value  selection  strategy
                                                    for  the  bot.   You   can
                                                    choose  to  use  the value
                                                    entered by  the  user,  or
                                                    you  can  have  Amazon Lex
                                                    choose the first value  in
                                                    the resolvedValues list.

                                                 the  slot. For example, for a
                                                 slot that elicits pizza  top-
                                                 pings,  the  values  might be

                            the  slot.  Slots that are not included in the map
                            aren't overridden.

                            key -> (string)

                            value -> (structure)

                                   indicates that the value field  contains  a
                                   single value.

                               value -> (structure)

                                      the slot. The actual  value  depends  on
                                      the   setting  of  the  value  selection
                                      strategy for the bot. You can choose  to
                                      use  the  value  entered by the user, or
                                      you can have Amazon Lex choose the first
                                      value in the resolvedValues list.

                                   provided for the slot. For example,  for  a
                                   slot  that elicits pizza toppings, the val-
                                   ues might be "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                          When the shape value is  List  ,  it
                                          indicates that the values field con-
                                          tains a list of  slot  values.  When
                                          the  value  is Scalar , it indicates
                                          that the value field contains a sin-
                                          gle value.

                                      value -> (structure)

                                             mines for the  slot.  The  actual
                                             value  depends  on the setting of
                                             the value selection strategy  for
                                             the  bot.  You  can choose to use
                                             the value entered by the user, or
                                             you  can  have  Amazon Lex choose
                                             the first value in the  resolved-
                                             Values list.

                                          example,  for  a  slot  that elicits
                                          pizza toppings, the values might  be
                                          "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                   key -> (string)

                                   value -> (structure)
                                      The  slot  values  that  Amazon Lex uses
                                      when it sets slot  values  in  a  dialog
                                      step.

                                      shape -> (string)
                                          When  the  shape  value is List , it
                                          indicates that the values field con-
                                          tains  a  list  of slot values. When
                                          the value is Scalar ,  it  indicates
                                          that the value field contains a sin-
                                          gle value.

                                      value -> (structure)

                                             The value that Amazon Lex  deter-
                                             mines  for  the  slot. The actual
                                             value depends on the  setting  of
                                             the  value selection strategy for
                                             the bot. You can  choose  to  use
                                             the value entered by the user, or
                                             you can have  Amazon  Lex  choose
                                             the  first value in the resolved-
                                             Values list.

                                      values -> (list)
                                          A list of one or  more  values  that
                                          the  user provided for the slot. For
                                          example, for  a  slot  that  elicits
                                          pizza  toppings, the values might be
                                          "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                          (structure)
                                             The slot values that  Amazon  Lex
                                             uses  when it sets slot values in
                                             a dialog step.

                                             shape -> (string)
                                                 When the shape value is  List
                                                 ,  it indicates that the val-
                                                 ues field contains a list  of
                                                 slot  values.  When the value
                                                 is Scalar , it indicates that
                                                 the  value  field  contains a
                                                 single value.

                                                 slot.

                                                 interpretedValue -> (string)
                                                    The  value that Amazon Lex
                                                    determines for  the  slot.
                                                    The  actual  value depends
                                                    on  the  setting  of   the
                                                    value  selection  strategy
                                                    for  the  bot.   You   can
                                                    choose  to  use  the value
                                                    entered by  the  user,  or
                                                    you  can  have  Amazon Lex
                                                    choose the first value  in
                                                    the resolvedValues list.

                                                 the  slot. For example, for a
                                                 slot that elicits pizza  top-
                                                 pings,  the  values  might be
                                                 "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                            switching intents.

                        slots -> (map)
                            A  map  of all of the slot value overrides for the
                            intent. The name of the slot maps to the value  of
                            the  slot.  Slots that are not included in the map
                            aren't overridden.

                            key -> (string)

                            value -> (structure)
                               The slot values that Amazon Lex  uses  when  it
                               sets slot values in a dialog step.

                               shape -> (string)
                                   When the shape value is List , it indicates
                                   that the values field contains  a  list  of
                                   slot  values. When the value is Scalar , it
                                   indicates that the value field  contains  a
                                   single value.

                               value -> (structure)
                                   The current value of the slot.

                                   interpretedValue -> (string)
                                      The value that Amazon Lex determines for
                                      the slot. The actual  value  depends  on
                                      the   setting  of  the  value  selection
                                      strategy for the bot. You can choose  to
                                      use  the  value  entered by the user, or
                                      you can have Amazon Lex choose the first
                                      value in the resolvedValues list.

                               values -> (list)
                                   A  list of one or more values that the user
                                   provided for the slot. For example,  for  a
                                   slot  that elicits pizza toppings, the val-
                                   ues might be "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                   (structure)
                                      The slot values  that  Amazon  Lex  uses
                                      when  it  sets  slot  values in a dialog
                                      step.

                                      shape -> (string)
                                          When the shape value is  List  ,  it
                                          indicates that the values field con-
                                          tains a list of  slot  values.  When
                                          the  value  is Scalar , it indicates
                                          that the value field contains a sin-
                                          gle value.

                                      value -> (structure)

                                             mines for the  slot.  The  actual
                                             value  depends  on the setting of
                                             the value selection strategy  for
                                             the  bot.  You  can choose to use
                                             the value entered by the user, or
                                             you  can  have  Amazon Lex choose
                                             the first value in the  resolved-
                                             Values list.

                                      values -> (list)

                                          the user provided for the slot.  For
                                          example,  for  a  slot  that elicits
                                          pizza toppings, the values might  be
                                          "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                               slot.  The  actual value depends on the setting
                               of the value selection strategy  for  the  bot.
                               You  can choose to use the value entered by the
                               user, or you can have  Amazon  Lex  choose  the
                               first value in the resolvedValues list.

                        values -> (list)

                            vided for the slot. For example, for a  slot  that
                            elicits  pizza toppings, the values might be "pep-
                            peroni" and "pineapple."

                            (structure)
                               The slot values that Amazon Lex  uses  when  it
                               sets slot values in a dialog step.

                               shape -> (string)
                                   When the shape value is List , it indicates
                                   that the values field contains  a  list  of
                                   slot  values. When the value is Scalar , it
                                   indicates that the value field  contains  a
                                   single value.

                               value -> (structure)

                                   interpretedValue -> (string)
                                      The value that Amazon Lex determines for
                                      the slot. The actual  value  depends  on
                                      the   setting  of  the  value  selection
                                      strategy for the bot. You can choose  to
                                      use  the  value  entered by the user, or
                                      you can have Amazon Lex choose the first
                                      value in the resolvedValues list.

                               values -> (list)

              in the order that they are entered in the list. The first branch
              with a condition that evaluates to true is  executed.  The  last
              branch  in  the  list  is the default branch. The default branch
              should not have any condition expression. The default branch  is
              executed if no other branch has a matching condition.

              active -> (boolean)

                               the  intent.  The  name of the slot maps to the
                               value of the slot. Slots that are not  included
                               in the map aren't overridden.

                               key -> (string)

                                          for  the  slot. The actual value de-
                                          pends on the setting  of  the  value
                                          selection  strategy for the bot. You
                                          can choose to use the value  entered
                                          by  the user, or you can have Amazon
                                          Lex choose the first  value  in  the
                                          resolvedValues list.

                                             When the shape value is List , it
                                             indicates that the  values  field
                                             contains  a  list of slot values.
                                             When the value is Scalar , it in-
                                             dicates that the value field con-

                                      strategy for the bot. You can choose  to
                                      use  the  value  entered by the user, or
                                      you can have Amazon Lex choose the first
                                      value in the resolvedValues list.

                                          indicates that the values field con-
                                          tains a list of  slot  values.  When
                                          the  value  is Scalar , it indicates
                                          that the value field contains a sin-

                                             mines for the  slot.  The  actual
                                             value  depends  on the setting of
                                             the value selection strategy  for
                                             the  bot.  You  can choose to use
                                             the value entered by the user, or
                                             you  can  have  Amazon Lex choose

                                          example,  for  a  slot  that elicits
                                          pizza toppings, the values might  be
                                          "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                          tains  a  list  of slot values. When
                                          the value is Scalar ,  it  indicates
                                          that the value field contains a sin-
                                          gle value.

                                             mines  for  the  slot. The actual
                                             value depends on the  setting  of
                                             the  value selection strategy for
                                             the bot. You can  choose  to  use
                                             the value entered by the user, or
                                             you can have  Amazon  Lex  choose
                                             the  first value in the resolved-

                                          example, for  a  slot  that  elicits
                                          pizza  toppings, the values might be
                                          "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                   A  map  of  all of the slot value overrides
                                   for the intent. The name of the  slot  maps
                                   to  the  value  of the slot. Slots that are
                                   not included in the map aren't overridden.

                                   key -> (string)

                                      step.

                                      shape -> (string)
                                          When the shape value is  List  ,  it
                                          indicates that the values field con-
                                          tains a list of  slot  values.  When
                                          the  value  is Scalar , it indicates
                                          that the value field contains a sin-
                                          gle value.

                                             mines for the  slot.  The  actual
                                             value  depends  on the setting of
                                             the value selection strategy  for
                                             the  bot.  You  can choose to use
                                             the value entered by the user, or
                                             you  can  have  Amazon Lex choose
                                             the first value in the  resolved-
                                             Values list.

                                      values -> (list)

                                          the user provided for the slot.  For
                                          example,  for  a  slot  that elicits
                                          pizza toppings, the values might  be
                                          "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                          (structure)

                                             uses when it sets slot values  in
                                             a dialog step.

                                             shape -> (string)
                                                 When  the shape value is List
                                                 , it indicates that the  val-
                                                 ues  field contains a list of
                                                 slot values. When  the  value
                                                 is Scalar , it indicates that
                                                 the value  field  contains  a
                                                 single value.

                                                 slot.

                                                 interpretedValue -> (string)
                                                    The value that Amazon  Lex
                                                    determines  for  the slot.
                                                    The actual  value  depends
                                                    on   the  setting  of  the
                                                    value  selection  strategy
                                                    for   the   bot.  You  can
                                                    choose to  use  the  value
                                                    entered  by  the  user, or
                                                    you can  have  Amazon  Lex
                                                    choose  the first value in
                                                    the resolvedValues list.

                                                 the slot. For example, for  a
                                                 slot  that elicits pizza top-
                                                 pings, the  values  might  be
                                                 "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                            intent. The name of the slot maps to the value  of
                            the  slot.  Slots that are not included in the map
                            aren't overridden.

                                      the slot. The actual  value  depends  on
                                      the   setting  of  the  value  selection
                                      strategy for the bot. You can choose  to
                                      use  the  value  entered by the user, or
                                      you can have Amazon Lex choose the first
                                      value in the resolvedValues list.

                                   ues might be "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                   (structure)

                                          When the shape value is  List  ,  it
                                          indicates that the values field con-
                                          tains a list of  slot  values.  When
                                          the  value  is Scalar , it indicates
                                          that the value field contains a sin-
                                          gle value.

                                             mines for the  slot.  The  actual
                                             value  depends  on the setting of
                                             the value selection strategy  for
                                             the  bot.  You  can choose to use
                                             the value entered by the user, or
                                             you  can  have  Amazon Lex choose
                                             the first value in the  resolved-
                                             Values list.

                                          example,  for  a  slot  that elicits
                                          pizza toppings, the values might  be
                                          "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                                 termines for  the  slot.  The
                                                 actual  value  depends on the
                                                 setting of the  value  selec-
                                                 tion  strategy  for  the bot.

                                                    When  the  shape  value is
                                                    List , it  indicates  that

                                                    it  indicates   that   the
                                                    value   field  contains  a
                                                    single value.

                                                 value -> (structure)

                                                        The value that  Amazon
                                                        Lex determines for the
                                                        slot. The actual value
                                                        depends on the setting

                                                        the user, or  you  can
                                                        have Amazon Lex choose
                                                        the first value in the

                                   A  map  of  all of the slot value overrides
                                   for the intent. The name of the  slot  maps
                                   to  the  value  of the slot. Slots that are
                                   not included in the map aren't overridden.

                                   key -> (string)

                                   value -> (structure)

                                      when  it  sets  slot  values in a dialog
                                      step.

                                      shape -> (string)
                                          When the shape value is  List  ,  it
                                          indicates that the values field con-
                                          tains a list of  slot  values.  When
                                          the  value  is Scalar , it indicates
                                          that the value field contains a sin-
                                          gle value.

                                             The  value that Amazon Lex deter-
                                             mines for the  slot.  The  actual
                                             value  depends  on the setting of
                                             the value selection strategy  for
                                             the  bot.  You  can choose to use
                                             the value entered by the user, or
                                             you  can  have  Amazon Lex choose
                                             the first value in the  resolved-
                                             Values list.

                                      values -> (list)
                                          A  list  of  one or more values that
                                          the user provided for the slot.  For
                                          example,  for  a  slot  that elicits
                                          pizza toppings, the values might  be
                                          "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                          (structure)

                                             uses when it sets slot values  in
                                             a dialog step.

                                             shape -> (string)
                                                 When  the shape value is List
                                                 , it indicates that the  val-
                                                 ues  field contains a list of
                                                 slot values. When  the  value
                                                 is Scalar , it indicates that
                                                 the value  field  contains  a
                                                 single value.

                                                 slot.

                                                 interpretedValue -> (string)
                                                    The value that Amazon  Lex
                                                    determines  for  the slot.
                                                    The actual  value  depends
                                                    on   the  setting  of  the
                                                    value  selection  strategy
                                                    for   the   bot.  You  can
                                                    choose to  use  the  value
                                                    entered  by  the  user, or
                                                    you can  have  Amazon  Lex
                                                    choose  the first value in
                                                    the resolvedValues list.

                                             values -> (list)

                                                 the slot. For example, for  a
                                                 slot  that elicits pizza top-
                                                 pings, the  values  might  be
                                                 "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                      the  slot.  The  actual value depends on
                                      the  setting  of  the  value   selection
                                      strategy  for the bot. You can choose to
                                      use the value entered by  the  user,  or
                                      you can have Amazon Lex choose the first
                                      value in the resolvedValues list.

                                          indicates that the values field con-
                                          tains  a  list  of slot values. When
                                          the value is Scalar ,  it  indicates
                                          that the value field contains a sin-
                                          gle value.

                                             mines  for  the  slot. The actual
                                             value depends on the  setting  of
                                             the  value selection strategy for
                                             the bot. You can  choose  to  use
                                             the value entered by the user, or
                                             you can have  Amazon  Lex  choose
                                             the  first value in the resolved-
                                             Values list.

                                          example, for  a  slot  that  elicits
                                          pizza  toppings, the values might be
                                          "pepperoni" and "pineapple."

                                                 , it indicates that the  val-
                                                 ues  field contains a list of
                                                 slot values. When  the  value
                                                 is Scalar , it indicates that
                                                 the value  field  contains  a

                                                    The actual  value  depends
                                                    on   the  setting  of  the

                                                    entered  by  the  user, or
                                                    you can  have  Amazon  Lex
                                                    choose  the first value in
