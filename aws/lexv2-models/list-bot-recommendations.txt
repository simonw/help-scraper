       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-bot-recommendations
          --bot-id <value>
          --bot-version <value>
          --locale-id <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bot-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier of the bot that contains the bot recommenda-
          tion list.

       --bot-version (string)
          The version of the bot that contains the bot recommendation list.

       --locale-id (string)
          The identifier of the language and locale of the bot  recommendation
          list.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of bot recommendations to return in each page of
          results. If there are fewer results than the max page size, only the
          actual number of results are returned.

       --next-token (string)
          If  the  response  from the ListBotRecommendation operation contains
          more results than specified in the maxResults parameter, a token  is
          returned  in the response. Use that token in the nextToken parameter
          to return the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       botId -> (string)
          The unique identifier of the bot that contains the  bot  recommenda-
          tion list.

       botVersion -> (string)
          The version of the bot that contains the bot recommendation list.

       localeId -> (string)
          The  identifier of the language and locale of the bot recommendation
          list.

       botRecommendationSummaries -> (list)
          Summary information for the bot recommendations that meet the filter
          specified  in  this  request. The length of the list is specified in
          the maxResults parameter of the request. If there are more bot  rec-
          ommendations  available, the nextToken field contains a token to get
          the next page of results.

          (structure)
              A summary of the bot recommendation.

              botRecommendationStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the bot recommendation.

                 If the status is Failed, then the reasons for the failure are
                 listed in the failureReasons field.

              botRecommendationId -> (string)
                 The  unique  identifier  of  the bot recommendation to be up-
                 dated.

              creationDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp of the date and time that the bot  recommendation
                 was created.

              lastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  timestamp of the date and time that the bot recommendation
                 was last updated.

       nextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates whether there are more results to return in a
          response  to  the ListBotRecommendations operation. If the nextToken
          field is present, you send the contents as the  nextToken  parameter
          of  a  ListBotRecommendations operation request to get the next page
          of results.
