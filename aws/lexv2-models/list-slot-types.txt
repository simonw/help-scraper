OPTIONS
       --bot-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the bot that contains the slot types.

       --bot-version (string)
          The version of the bot that contains the slot type.

       --locale-id (string)
          The identifier of the language and locale of the slot types to list.
          The string must match one of the supported locales. For more  infor-
          mation, see Supported languages .

       --sort-by (structure)
          Determines  the  sort  order for the response from the ListSlotTypes
          operation. You can choose to sort by the slot type name or last  up-
          dated date in either ascending or descending order.

          attribute -> (string)
              The attribute to use to sort the list of slot types.

          order -> (string)
              The order to sort the list. You can say ascending or descending.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attribute=string,order=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attribute": "SlotTypeName"|"LastUpdatedDateTime",
            "order": "Ascending"|"Descending"
          }

       --filters (list)
          Provides  the specification of a filter used to limit the slot types
          in the response to only those that match the  filter  specification.
          You can only specify one filter and only one string to filter on.

          (structure)
              Filters the response from the ListSlotTypes operation.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the field to use for filtering.

              values -> (list)
                 The value to use to filter the response.

                 (string)

              operator -> (string)
                 The operator to use for the filter. Specify EQ when the List-
                 SlotTypes operation should return only aliases that equal the
                 specified  value. Specify CO when the ListSlotTypes operation
                 should return aliases that contain the specified value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string,operator=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "SlotTypeName"|"ExternalSourceType",
              "values": ["string", ...],
              "operator": "CO"|"EQ"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of slot types to return in each page of  results.
          If  there  are fewer results than the max page size, only the actual
          number of results are returned.

       --next-token (string)
          If the response from the ListSlotTypes operation contains  more  re-
          sults  than  specified  in  the maxResults parameter, a token is re-
          turned in the response. Use that token in the nextToken parameter to
          return the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       botId -> (string)
          The identifier of the bot that contains the slot types.

       botVersion -> (string)
          The version of the bot that contains the slot types.

       localeId -> (string)

       slotTypeSummaries -> (list)
          Summary information for the slot types that meet the filter criteria
          specified in the request. The length of the list is specified in the
          maxResults parameter of the request. If there are  more  slot  types
          available, the nextToken field contains a token to get the next page
          of results.

          (structure)
              Provides summary information about a slot type.

              slotTypeId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier assigned to the slot type.

              slotTypeName -> (string)
                 The name of the slot type.

              description -> (string)
                 The description of the slot type.

              parentSlotTypeSignature -> (string)
                 If the slot type is derived from a built-on  slot  type,  the
                 name of the parent slot type.

              lastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  timestamp of the date and time that the slot type was last
                 updated.

              slotTypeCategory -> (string)
                 Indicates the type of the slot type.

                 o Custom - A slot type that you created using custom  values.
                   For more information, see Creating custom slot types .

                 o Extended  - A slot type created by extending the AMAZON.Al-
                   phaNumeric built-in slot type. For  more  information,  see
                   AMAZON.AlphaNumeric .

                 o ExternalGrammar  - A slot type using a custom GRXML grammar
                   to define values. For more information, see Using a  custom

       nextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates whether there are more results to return in a
          response to the ListSlotTypes operation. If the nextToken  field  is
          present, you send the contents as the nextToken parameter of a List-
          SlotTypes operation request to get the next page of results.
