          script, as well as the associated metadata.

          s3BucketTranscriptSource -> (structure)
              Indicates  the  setting  of the Amazon S3 bucket where the tran-

                 The  object  that contains a path format that will be applied
                 when Amazon Lex reads the transcript file in the  bucket  you
                 provide.  Specify  this object if you only want Lex to read a
                 subset of files in your Amazon S3 bucket.

       --encryption-setting (structure)
          The  object  representing the passwords that will be used to encrypt
          the data related to the bot recommendation results, as well  as  the
          KMS key ARN used to encrypt the associated metadata.

          kmsKeyArn -> (string)
              The KMS key ARN used to encrypt the metadata associated with the
              bot recommendation.

          botLocaleExportPassword -> (string)
              The password used to encrypt the recommended bot  recommendation
              file.

          associatedTranscriptsPassword -> (string)
              The password used to encrypt the associated transcript file.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          kmsKeyArn=string,botLocaleExportPassword=string,associatedTranscriptsPassword=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "kmsKeyArn": "string",
            "botLocaleExportPassword": "string",

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
