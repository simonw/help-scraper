OPTIONS
       --bot-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the bot that contains the intent.

       --bot-version (string)
          The version of the bot that contains the intent.

       --locale-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the language and locale of the intents to list.
          The string must match one of the supported locales. For more  infor-
          mation, see Supported languages .

       --sort-by (structure)
          Determines  the sort order for the response from the ListIntents op-
          eration. You can choose to sort by the intent name or  last  updated
          date in either ascending or descending order.

          attribute -> (string)
              The attribute to use to sort the list of intents.

          order -> (string)
              The order to sort the list. You can choose ascending or descend-
              ing.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attribute=string,order=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attribute": "IntentName"|"LastUpdatedDateTime",
            "order": "Ascending"|"Descending"
          }

       --filters (list)
          Provides the specification of a filter used to limit the intents  in
          the  response to only those that match the filter specification. You
          can only specify one filter and only one string to filter on.

          (structure)
              Filters the response from the ListIntents operation.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the field to use for the filter.

              values -> (list)
                 The value to use for the filter.

                 (string)

              operator -> (string)
                 The operator to use for  the  filter.  Specify  EQ  when  the
                 ListIntents  operation  should return only aliases that equal
                 the specified value. Specify CO when the  ListIntents  opera-
                 tion should return aliases that contain the specified value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string,operator=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "IntentName",
              "values": ["string", ...],
              "operator": "CO"|"EQ"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of intents to return in each page of results. If
          there are fewer results than the max page size, only the actual num-
          ber of results are returned.

       --next-token (string)
          If the response from the ListIntents operation contains more results
          than specified in the maxResults parameter, a token is  returned  in
          the response.

          Use  the  returned token in the nextToken parameter of a ListIntents
          request to return the next page of results. For a  complete  set  of
          results, call the ListIntents operation until the nextToken returned
          in the response is null.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

                        text should remain active. The time  is  figured  from

                        text should remain active.  The  number  of  turns  is
                        counted  from  the first time that the context is sent

          ListIntents operation request to get the next page of results.
