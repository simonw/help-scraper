SYNOPSIS
            list-bots
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --sort-by (structure)
          Specifies  sorting  parameters for the list of bots. You can specify
          that the list be sorted by bot name in ascending or  descending  or-
          der.

          attribute -> (string)
              The attribute to use to sort the list of bots.

          order -> (string)
              The order to sort the list. You can choose ascending or descend-
              ing.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attribute=string,order=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attribute": "BotName",
            "order": "Ascending"|"Descending"
          }

       --filters (list)
          Provides the specification of a filter used to limit the bots in the
          response  to only those that match the filter specification. You can
          only specify one filter and one string to filter on.

          (structure)
              Filters the responses returned by the ListBots operation.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the field to filter the list of bots.

              values -> (list)
                 The value to use for filtering the list of bots.

                 (string)

              operator -> (string)
                 The operator to use for the filter. Specify EQ when the List-
                 Bots  operation  should  return  only  aliases that equal the
                 specified value.  Specify  CO  when  the  ListBots  operation
                 should return aliases that contain the specified value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string,operator=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "BotName",
              "values": ["string", ...],
              "operator": "CO"|"EQ"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  bots to return in each page of results. If
          there are fewer results than the maximum page size, only the  actual
          number of results are returned.

       --next-token (string)
          If  the  response  from the ListBots operation contains more results
          than specified in the maxResults parameter, a token is  returned  in
          the response.

          Use  the returned token in the nextToken parameter of a ListBots re-
          quest to return the next page of results. For a complete set of  re-
          sults,  call  the ListBots operation until the nextToken returned in
          the response is null.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       botSummaries -> (list)
          Summary information for the bots that meet the filter criteria spec-
          ified  in  the  request.  The length of the list is specified in the
          maxResults parameter of the request. If there are more  bots  avail-
          able,  the  nextToken field contains a token to the next page of re-
          sults.

          (structure)
              Summary information about a bot returned by the ListBots  opera-
              tion.

              botId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier assigned to the bot. Use this ID to get
                 detailed information about the bot with the DescribeBot oper-
                 ation.

              botName -> (string)
                 The name of the bot.

              description -> (string)
                 The description of the bot.

              botStatus -> (string)
                 The  current  status of the bot. When the status is Available
                 the bot is ready for use.

              latestBotVersion -> (string)
                 The latest numerical version in use for the bot.

              lastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the bot was last updated.

       nextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates whether there are more results to return in a
          response  to  the  ListBots  operation.  If  the  nextToken field is
          present, you send the contents as the nextToken parameter of a List-
          Bots operation request to get the next page of results.
