OPTIONS
       --bot-id (string)
          The unique identifier that Amazon Lex assigned to the bot.

       --bot-version (string)
          The version of the bot to list exports for.

       --sort-by (structure)
          Determines the field that the list of exports is sorted by. You  can
          sort by the LastUpdatedDateTime field in ascending or descending or-
          der.

          attribute -> (string)
              The export field to use for sorting.

          order -> (string)
              The order to sort the list.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attribute=string,order=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attribute": "LastUpdatedDateTime",
            "order": "Ascending"|"Descending"
          }

       --filters (list)
          Provides the specification of a filter used to limit the exports  in
          the  response to only those that match the filter specification. You
          can only specify one filter and one string to filter on.

          (structure)
              Filters the response form the ListExports operation

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the field to use for filtering.

              values -> (list)
                 The values to use to filter the response. The values must  be
                 Bot , BotLocale , or CustomVocabulary .

                 (string)

              operator -> (string)
                 The operator to use for the filter. Specify EQ when the List-
                 Exports operation should  return  only  resource  types  that
                 equal  the  specified  value. Specify CO when the ListExports
                 operation should return resource types that contain the spec-
                 ified value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string,operator=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "ExportResourceType",
              "values": ["string", ...],
              "operator": "CO"|"EQ"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of exports to return in each page of results. If
          there are fewer results than the max page size, only the actual num-
          ber of results are returned.

       --next-token (string)
          If the response from the ListExports operation contains more results
          that specified in the maxResults parameter, a token is  returned  in
          the response.

          Use  the  returned token in the nextToken parameter of a ListExports
          request to return the next page of results. For a  complete  set  of
          results, call the ListExports operation until the nextToken returned
          in the response is null.

       --locale-id (string)
          Specifies the resources that should be exported. If you don't  spec-
          ify  a  resource type in the filters parameter, both bot locales and
          custom vocabularies are exported.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
