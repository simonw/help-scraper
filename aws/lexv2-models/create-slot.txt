CREATE-SLOT()                                                    CREATE-SLOT()



NAME
       create-slot -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a slot in an intent. A slot is a variable needed to fulfill an
       intent. For example, an OrderPizza intent might need  slots  for  size,
       crust,  and number of pizzas. For each slot, you define one or more ut-
       terances that Amazon Lex uses to elicit a response from the user.

          contains the slot.

       --description (string)
          A  description  of  the  slot. Use this to help identify the slot in
          lists.

       --slot-type-id (string)

              specify  default  values  from  context  variables,  session at-
              tributes, and defined values.

              defaultValueList -> (list)
                 A list of default values.  Amazon  Lex  chooses  the  default

                                          is  returned  when  they choose this

       --obfuscation-setting (structure)
          Determines  how  slot  values are used in Amazon CloudWatch logs. If
          the value of the obfuscationSetting parameter is  DefaultObfuscation
          , slot values are obfuscated in the log output. If the value is None
          , the actual value is present in the log output.

          The default is to obfuscate values in the CloudWatch logs.

          obfuscationSettingType -> (string)
              Value that determines whether Amazon Lex obscures slot values in
              conversation logs. The default is to obscure the values.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          obfuscationSettingType=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "obfuscationSettingType": "None"|"DefaultObfuscation"
          }

       --bot-id (string)
          The identifier of the bot associated with the slot.

       --bot-version (string)
          The version of the bot associated with the slot.

       --locale-id (string)
          The identifier of the language and locale that the slot will be used
          in. The string must match one of the supported locales. All  of  the
          bots,  intents,  slot  types used by the slot must have the same lo-
          cale. For more information, see Supported languages .

       --intent-id (string)
          The identifier of the intent that contains the slot.

       --multiple-values-setting (structure)
          Indicates whether the slot returns multiple values in one  response.
          Multi-value slots are only available in the en-US locale. If you set
          this value to true in any other locale, Amazon Lex throws a  Valida-
          tionException .

          If  the multipleValuesSetting is not set, the default value is false
          .

          allowMultipleValues -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether a slot can return multiple values. When true ,
              the  slot  may  return  more  than one value in a response. When
              false , the slot returns only a single value.

              Multi-value slots are only available in the en-US locale. If you
              set  this value to true in any other locale, Amazon Lex throws a
              ValidationException .

              If the allowMutlipleValues is not  set,  the  default  value  is
              false .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          allowMultipleValues=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "allowMultipleValues": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          defaultValueSpecification -> (structure)
              A list of default values for a slot.  Default  values  are  used

                     defaultValue -> (string)
                        The default value to use when a user doesn't provide a
                        value for a slot.

                 A collection of messages that Amazon  Lex  can  send  to  the
                 user.  Amazon  Lex chooses the actual message to send at run-
                 time.

                                      displaying  the response card has access
                                      to the image.

                                      rangement of the buttons  is  determined
                                      by  the  platform that displays the but-

                 frequencyInSeconds -> (integer)

                     of 1 second, maximum of 5 minutes.

          zon CloudWatch logs.

          obfuscationSettingType -> (string)

              the  slot  may  return  more  than one value in a response. When
              false , the slot returns only a single value.

              Multi-value slots are only available in the en-US locale. If you
              set  this value to true in any other locale, Amazon Lex throws a
              ValidationException .

              If the allowMutlipleValues is not  set,  the  default  value  is
              false .
