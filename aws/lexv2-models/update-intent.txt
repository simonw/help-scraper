       --slot-priorities (list)
          A  new  list of slots and their priorities that are contained by the
          intent.

          (structure)
              Sets the priority that Amazon Lex should use when eliciting slot
              values from a user.

              priority -> (integer)
                 The priority that a slot should be elicited.

              slotId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the slot.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          priority=integer,slotId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "priority": integer,
              "slotId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --intent-confirmation-setting (structure)
          New prompts that Amazon Lex sends to the user to confirm the comple-
          tion of an intent.

          promptSpecification -> (structure)
              Prompts the user to confirm the  intent.  This  question  should
              have a yes or no answer.

              Amazon Lex uses this prompt to ensure that the user acknowledges
              that the intent is ready for fulfillment. For example, with  the
              OrderPizza  intent,  you might want to confirm that the order is
              correct before placing it. For other intents,  such  as  intents
              that simply respond to user questions, you might not need to ask
              the user for confirmation before providing the information.

              messageGroups -> (list)
                 A collection of messages that Amazon  Lex  can  send  to  the
                 user.  Amazon  Lex chooses the actual message to send at run-
                 time.

                 (structure)
                     Provides one or more messages that Amazon Lex should send
                     to the user.

                     message -> (structure)
                        The primary message that Amazon Lex should send to the
                        user.

                        plainTextMessage -> (structure)
                            A message in plain text format.

                            value -> (string)

                            A message in a custom format defined by the client
                            application.

                            value -> (string)
                               The string that is sent to your application.

                        ssmlMessage -> (structure)
                            A  message  in  Speech  Synthesis  Markup Language
                            (SSML).

                            value -> (string)
                               The SSML text that defines the prompt.

                        imageResponseCard -> (structure)
                            A message that defines a response  card  that  the
                            client application can show to the user.

                            title -> (string)
                               The  title to display on the response card. The
                               format of the title is determined by the  plat-
                               form displaying the response card.

                            subtitle -> (string)

                               The format of the subtitle is determined by the

                            imageUrl -> (string)
                               The  URL of an image to display on the response
                               card. The image URL must be publicly  available
                               so  that  the  platform displaying the response
                               card has access to the image.

                            buttons -> (list)
                               A list of buttons that should be  displayed  on
                               the  response card. The arrangement of the but-
                               tons is determined by the  platform  that  dis-
                               plays the button.

                               (structure)
                                   Describes  a  button  to  use on a response
                                   card used to  gather  slot  values  from  a
                                   user.

                                   text -> (string)
                                      The text that appears on the button. Use
                                      this to tell the user what value is  re-
                                      turned when they choose this button.

                                   value -> (string)
                                      The  value  returned  to Amazon Lex when
                                      the user chooses this button. This  must
                                      be one of the slot values configured for
                                      the slot.

                                          is  returned  when  they choose this
                                          button.

                                          This must be one of the slot  values
                                          configured for the slot.

              allowInterrupt -> (boolean)

              this  field  is  false,  the  closing response isn't sent to the
              user. If the active field isn't specified, the default is true.

                                      response card. The  image  URL  must  be
                                      publicly  available so that the platform
                                      displaying the response card has  access
                                      to the image.

                                      rangement  of  the buttons is determined
                                      by the platform that displays  the  but-

                                             ton. Use this to  tell  the  user
                                             what  value is returned when they
                                             choose this button.

                                             ton. This must be one of the slot
                                             values configured for the slot.

                 allowInterrupt -> (boolean)

                     the  period  ends,  Amazon Lex chooses a message from the
                     message groups and plays it to the user. If the  fulfill-
                     ment  Lambda returns before the first period ends, an up-
                     date message is not played to the user.

                                   sponse card.

                                   that displays the button.

                                      played  on  the  response  card. The ar-
                                      rangement of the buttons  is  determined
                                      by  the  platform that displays the but-

                                             what value is returned when  they
                                             choose this button.

                                             values configured for the slot.

                 allowInterrupt -> (boolean)

              have a yes or no answer.

              Amazon Lex uses this prompt to ensure that the user acknowledges
              that  the intent is ready for fulfillment. For example, with the
              OrderPizza intent, you might want to confirm that the  order  is
              correct  before  placing  it. For other intents, such as intents
              that simply respond to user questions, you might not need to ask
              the user for confirmation before providing the information.

              messageGroups -> (list)
