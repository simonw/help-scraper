OPTIONS
       --bot-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier  of  the bot associated with the transcripts
          that you are searching.

       --bot-version (string)
          The version of the bot  containing  the  transcripts  that  you  are
          searching.

       --locale-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the  language  and locale of the transcripts to
          search. The string must match one of the supported locales. For more
          information, see Supported languages

       --bot-recommendation-id (string)
          The  unique identifier of the bot recommendation associated with the
          transcripts to search.

       --search-order (string)
          How SearchResults are ordered. Valid values  are  Ascending  or  De-
          scending. The default is Descending.

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --filters (list)
          A list of filter objects.

          (structure)
              Filters to search for the associated transcript.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the field to use for filtering. The allowed names
                 are IntentId and SlotTypeId.

              values -> (list)
                 The values to use to filter the transcript.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "IntentId"|"SlotTypeId",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of bot recommendations to return in each page  of
          results. If there are fewer results than the max page size, only the
          actual number of results are returned.

       --next-index (integer)
          If the response from the  SearchAssociatedTranscriptsRequest  opera-
          tion  contains more results than specified in the maxResults parame-
          ter, an index is returned in the response. Use  that  index  in  the
          nextIndex parameter to return the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       botId -> (string)
          The  unique  identifier  of  the bot associated with the transcripts
          that you are searching.

       botVersion -> (string)
          The version of the bot  containing  the  transcripts  that  you  are
          searching.

       localeId -> (string)
          The  identifier  of  the  language  and locale of the transcripts to
          search. The string must match one of the supported locales. For more
          information, see Supported languages

       botRecommendationId -> (string)
          The  unique identifier of the bot recommendation associated with the
          transcripts to search.

       nextIndex -> (integer)
          A index that indicates whether there are more results to return in a
          response  to  the SearchAssociatedTranscripts operation. If the nex-
          tIndex field is present, you send the contents as the nextIndex  pa-
          rameter of a SearchAssociatedTranscriptsRequest operation to get the
          next page of results.

       associatedTranscripts -> (list)
          The object that contains the associated  transcript  that  meet  the
          criteria you specified.

          (structure)
              The  object  containing  information  that associates the recom-
              mended intent/slot type with a conversation.

              transcript -> (string)
                 The content of the transcript that meets  the  search  filter
                 criteria.  For  the JSON format of the transcript, see Output
                 transcript format .

       totalResults -> (integer)
          The total number of transcripts returned by the search.
