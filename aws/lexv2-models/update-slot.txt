          CloudWatch logs.

          obfuscationSettingType -> (string)
              Value that determines whether Amazon Lex obscures slot values in
              conversation logs. The default is to obscure the values.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          obfuscationSettingType=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "obfuscationSettingType": "None"|"DefaultObfuscation"
          }

       --bot-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the bot that contains the slot.

       --bot-version (string)
          The  version of the bot that contains the slot. Must always be DRAFT
          .

       --locale-id (string)
          The identifier of the language and locale that  contains  the  slot.
          The  string must match one of the supported locales. For more infor-
          mation, see Supported languages .

       --intent-id (string)
          The identifier of the intent that contains the slot.

       --multiple-values-setting (structure)
          Determines whether the slot accepts multiple values in one response.
          Multiple  value slots are only available in the en-US locale. If you
          set this value to true in any other locale, Amazon Lex throws a Val-
          idationException .

          If  the multipleValuesSetting is not set, the default value is false
          .

          allowMultipleValues -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether a slot can return multiple values. When true ,
              the  slot  may  return  more  than one value in a response. When
              false , the slot returns only a single value.

              Multi-value slots are only available in the en-US locale. If you
              set  this value to true in any other locale, Amazon Lex throws a
              ValidationException .

              If the allowMutlipleValues is not  set,  the  default  value  is
              false .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          allowMultipleValues=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "allowMultipleValues": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                                      by  the  platform that displays the but-

              the slot may return more than one  value  in  a  response.  When
              false , the slot returns only a single value.

              Multi-value slots are only available in the en-US locale. If you
