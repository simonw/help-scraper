GET-RECORDS()                                                    GET-RECORDS()



NAME
       get-records -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the stream records from a given shard.

       Specify  a  shard iterator using the ShardIterator parameter. The shard
       iterator specifies the position in the shard from  which  you  want  to
       start  reading  stream  records  sequentially.  If  there are no stream
       records available in the portion of the shard that the iterator  points
       to,  GetRecords returns an empty list. Note that it might take multiple
       calls to get to a portion of the shard that contains stream records.

       NOTE:
          GetRecords can retrieve a maximum of 1 MB of  data  or  1000  stream
          records, whichever comes first.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-records
          --shard-iterator <value>
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --shard-iterator (string)
          A shard iterator that was retrieved from a previous GetShardIterator
          operation. This iterator can be used to access the stream records in
          this shard.

       --limit (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of records to return from the shard. The upper
          limit is 1000.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get records from a Dynamodb stream

       The following get-records command retrieves records using the specified
       Amazon DynamoDB shard iterator.

OUTPUT
       Records -> (list)
          The  stream  records  from the shard, which were retrieved using the
          shard iterator.

          (structure)
              A description of a unique event within a stream.

              eventID -> (string)
                 A globally unique identifier for the event that was  recorded
                 in this stream record.

              eventName -> (string)
                 The  type  of data modification that was performed on the Dy-
                 namoDB table:

                 o INSERT - a new item was added to the table.

                 o MODIFY - one or more of an existing item's attributes  were
                   modified.

                 o REMOVE - the item was deleted from the table

              eventVersion -> (string)
                 The  version  number of the stream record format. This number
                 is updated whenever the structure of Record is modified.

                 Client applications must not assume  that  eventVersion  will
                 remain  at  a  particular value, as this number is subject to
                 change at any time. In general, eventVersion  will  only  in-
                 crease as the low-level DynamoDB Streams API evolves.

              eventSource -> (string)
                 The  AWS service from which the stream record originated. For
                 DynamoDB Streams, this is aws:dynamodb .

              awsRegion -> (string)
                 The region in which the GetRecords request was received.

              dynamodb -> (structure)
                 The main body of the stream record, containing all of the Dy-
                 namoDB-specific fields.

                 ApproximateCreationDateTime -> (timestamp)
                     The  approximate date and time when the stream record was
                     created, in UNIX epoch time format.

                 Keys -> (map)
                     The primary key attribute(s) for the DynamoDB  item  that
                     was modified.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Represents the data for an attribute.

                        Each  attribute  value  is  described  as a name-value
                        pair. The name is the data type, and the value is  the
                        data itself.

                        For more information, see Data Types in the Amazon Dy-
                        namoDB Developer Guide .

                        S -> (string)
                            An attribute of type String. For example:
                               "S": "Hello"

                        N -> (string)
                            An attribute of type Number. For example:
                               "N": "123.45"

                            Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB as
                            strings,  to  maximize  compatibility  across lan-
                            guages and  libraries.  However,  DynamoDB  treats
                            them  as  number  type attributes for mathematical
                            operations.

                        B -> (blob)
                            An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                               "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

                        SS -> (list)
                            An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                               "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                            (string)

                        NS -> (list)
                            An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                               "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                            Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB as
                            strings,  to  maximize  compatibility  across lan-
                            guages and  libraries.  However,  DynamoDB  treats
                            them  as  number  type attributes for mathematical
                            operations.

                        M -> (map)
                            An attribute of type Map. For example:
                               "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

                            key -> (string)

                            value -> (structure)
                               Represents the data for an attribute.

                               Each  attribute  value  is   described   as   a
                               name-value pair. The name is the data type, and
                               the value is the data itself.

                               Each   attribute   value   is  described  as  a
                               name-value pair. The name is the data type, and
                               the value is the data itself.
