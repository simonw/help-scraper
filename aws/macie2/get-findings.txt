OPTIONS
       --finding-ids (list)
          An  array of strings that lists the unique identifiers for the find-
          ings to retrieve. You can specify as many as 50  unique  identifiers
          in this array.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --sort-criteria (structure)
          The criteria for sorting the results of the request.

          attributeName -> (string)
              The  name  of  the property to sort the results by. Valid values
              are:    count,    createdAt,     policyDetails.action.apiCallDe-
              tails.firstSeen,   policyDetails.action.apiCallDetails.lastSeen,
              resourcesAffected, severity.score, type, and updatedAt.

          orderBy -> (string)
              The sort order to apply to the results, based on the  value  for
              the property specified by the attributeName property. Valid val-
              ues are: ASC, sort the results in ascending  order;  and,  DESC,
              sort the results in descending order.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attributeName=string,orderBy=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attributeName": "string",
            "orderBy": "ASC"|"DESC"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                     the corresponding sensitive data discovery result for the
                     finding.  If a finding applies to a large archive or com-
                     pressed file, this value is the path to a folder.  Other-
                     wise, this value is the path to a file.

                 jobArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the classification job
                     that produced the finding. This value is null if the ori-
                     gin  of  the  finding  (originType)  is  AUTOMATED_SENSI-
                     TIVE_DATA_DISCOVERY.

                 jobId -> (string)
                     The unique identifier for  the  classification  job  that
                     produced the finding. This value is null if the origin of
                     the finding (originType) is AUTOMATED_SENSITIVE_DATA_DIS-
                     COVERY.

                 originType -> (string)

                     produced  the  finding.  Possible  values   are:   SENSI-
                     TIVE_DATA_DISCOVERY_JOB,  for  a classification job; and,
                     AUTOMATED_SENSITIVE_DATA_DISCOVERY, for automated  sensi-
                     tive data discovery.

                 result -> (structure)

                        currences of sensitive data in the S3 object. A  find-
                        ing  includes location data for a maximum of 15 occur-
                        rences of sensitive data.

                        This value can help you determine whether to  investi-
                        gate  additional  occurrences  of sensitive data in an
                        object. You can do this by  referring  to  the  corre-
                        sponding sensitive data discovery result for the find-
                        ing (classificationDetails.detailedResultsLocation).

                                             data.  For  a  JSON or JSON Lines
                                             file, this is  the  path  to  the

                                             data. If the data is a  value  in
                                             an array, the path also indicates
                                             which value contains the data.

                                             that contains the sensitive data.
                                             For a JSON Lines file,  the  line
                                             index,  starting  from 0, for the

                                          For an Avro object container or Par-
                                          quet file, each Record object speci-
                                          fies a record index and the path  to
                                          a  field  in  a record that contains
                                          the sensitive data. For  a  JSON  or
                                          JSON  Lines file, each Record object
                                          specifies the path to a field or ar-
                                          ray   that  contains  the  sensitive
                                          data. For a JSON Lines file, it also
                                          specifies the index of the line that
                                          contains the data.

                                          (structure)
                                             Specifies the location of an  oc-

                                                 pression,  to  the  sensitive
                                                 data. For an Avro object con-
                                                 tainer  or Parquet file, this
                                                 is the path to the  field  in
                                                 the record (recordIndex) that
                                                 contains the data. For a JSON
                                                 or  JSON  Lines file, this is
                                                 the path to the field or  ar-
                                                 ray  that  contains the data.
                                                 If the data is a value in  an
                                                 array,  the  path  also indi-
                                                 cates  which  value  contains
                                                 the data.

                                                 If  Amazon Macie detects sen-

                                                 name  of  an  element exceeds
                                                 240 characters,  Macie  trun-
                                                 cates  the  name  by removing

                                                 of the name. If the resulting

                                                 ters,  Macie  also  truncates
                                                 the path, starting  with  the
                                                 first  element  in  the path,
                                                 until the path  contains  250
                                                 or fewer characters.

                                             recordIndex -> (long)
                                                 For  an Avro object container

                                                 sensitive  data.  For  a JSON
                                                 Lines file, the  line  index,
                                                 starting from 0, for the line
                                                 that contains  the  sensitive
                                                 data.  This value is always 0
                                                 for JSON files.

                                   type -> (string)

                     status -> (structure)
                        The status of the finding.

                        code -> (string)
                            The status of the finding. Possible values are:

                            o COMPLETE - Amazon Macie  successfully  completed
                              its  analysis  of the S3 object that the finding
                              applies to.

                            o PARTIAL - Macie analyzed only a  subset  of  the
                              data  in  the S3 object that the finding applies
                              to. For example, the object is an  archive  file
                              that contains files in an unsupported format.

                            o SKIPPED  -  Macie  wasn't able to analyze the S3
                              object that the finding applies to. For example,
                              the  object  is  a file that uses an unsupported

                        reason -> (string)
                            A brief description of the status of the  finding.
                            This  value  is  null  if the status (code) of the
                            finding is COMPLETE.

                            Amazon Macie uses this value to notify you of  any
                            errors, warnings, or considerations that might im-
                            pact your analysis of the finding and the affected
                            S3 object. Possible values are:

                            o ARCHIVE_CONTAINS_UNPROCESSED_FILES  - The object
                              is an archive file and Macie extracted and  ana-
                              lyzed  only some or none of the files in the ar-
                              chive. To determine which files Macie  analyzed,
                              if  any,  refer  to  the corresponding sensitive
                              data discovery result for the finding (classifi-
                              cationDetails.detailedResultsLocation).

                            o ARCHIVE_EXCEEDS_SIZE_LIMIT  -  The  object is an
                              archive file whose total  storage  size  exceeds
                              the size quota for this type of archive.

                            o ARCHIVE_NESTING_LEVEL_OVER_LIMIT - The object is
                              an archive file whose nested depth  exceeds  the
                              quota  for  the  maximum number of nested levels
                              that Macie analyzes for this type of archive.

                            o ARCHIVE_TOTAL_BYTES_EXTRACTED_OVER_LIMIT  -  The
                              object is an archive file that exceeds the quota
                              for the maximum amount of data  that  Macie  ex-
