NAME
       get-bucket-statistics -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  (queries)  aggregated statistical data about S3 buckets that
       Amazon Macie monitors and analyzes.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-statistics
          [--account-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the Amazon Web Services account.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       bucketCount -> (long)
          The total number of buckets.

       bucketCountByEffectivePermission -> (structure)
          The total number of buckets that are publicly accessible based on  a
          combination of permissions settings for each bucket.

          publiclyAccessible -> (long)
              The  total  number  of  buckets that allow the general public to
              have read or write access to the bucket.

          publiclyReadable -> (long)
              The total number of buckets that allow  the  general  public  to
              have read access to the bucket.

          publiclyWritable -> (long)
              The  total  number  of  buckets that allow the general public to
              have write access to the bucket.

          unknown -> (long)
              The total number of buckets that Amazon  Macie  wasn't  able  to
              evaluate permissions settings for. Macie can't determine whether
              these buckets are publicly accessible.

       bucketCountByEncryptionType -> (structure)
          The total number of buckets that use certain  types  of  server-side
          encryption  to  encrypt new objects by default. This object also re-
          ports the total number of buckets that don't encrypt new objects  by
          default.

          kmsManaged -> (long)
              The  total  number of buckets that use an KMS key to encrypt new
              objects by default, either an Amazon Web Services managed key or
              a  customer  managed  key.  These  buckets  use  KMS  encryption
              (SSE-KMS) by default.

          s3Managed -> (long)
              The total number of buckets that use an Amazon S3 managed key to
              encrypt new objects by default. These buckets use Amazon S3 man-
              aged encryption (SSE-S3) by default.

          unencrypted -> (long)
              The total number of buckets that don't encrypt  new  objects  by
              default. Default encryption is disabled for these buckets.

          unknown -> (long)
              The  total number of buckets that Amazon Macie doesn't have cur-
              rent encryption metadata for. Macie can't provide  current  data
              about the default encryption settings for these buckets.

       bucketCountByObjectEncryptionRequirement -> (structure)
          The  total  number  of buckets whose bucket policies do or don't re-
          quire server-side encryption of objects when objects are uploaded to
          the buckets.

          allowsUnencryptedObjectUploads -> (long)
              The  total  number of buckets that don't have a bucket policy or
              have a bucket policy that doesn't require server-side encryption
              of  new  objects.  If a bucket policy exists, the policy doesn't
              require PutObject requests to include the  x-amz-server-side-en-
              cryption header and it doesn't require the value for that header
              to be AES256 or aws:kms.

          deniesUnencryptedObjectUploads -> (long)
              The total  number  of  buckets  whose  bucket  policies  require
              server-side  encryption  of  new objects. PutObject requests for
              these  buckets  must  include  the  x-amz-server-side-encryption
              header and the value for that header must be AES256 or aws:kms.

          unknown -> (long)
              The  total  number  of  buckets that Amazon Macie wasn't able to
              evaluate server-side encryption requirements  for.  Macie  can't
              determine  whether the bucket policies for these buckets require
              server-side encryption of new objects.

       bucketCountBySharedAccessType -> (structure)
          The total number of buckets that are or aren't shared  with  another
          Amazon Web Services account.

              Services account that isn't part of the same Amazon Macie  orga-
              nization.

          internal -> (long)
              The  total  number of buckets that are shared with an Amazon Web
              Services account that's part of the same Amazon Macie  organiza-

              Web Services accounts.

          unknown -> (long)
              The total number of buckets that Amazon  Macie  wasn't  able  to
              evaluate  shared  access  settings  for.  Macie  can't determine
              whether these buckets are shared with other Amazon Web  Services
              accounts.

       classifiableObjectCount -> (long)
          The  total  number  of  objects that Amazon Macie can analyze in the
          buckets. These objects use a supported storage class and have a file
          name extension for a supported file or storage format.

       classifiableSizeInBytes -> (long)
          The total storage size, in bytes, of all the objects that Amazon Ma-
          cie can analyze in the buckets. These objects use a supported  stor-
          age  class  and  have  a file name extension for a supported file or
          storage format.

          If versioning is enabled for any of the  buckets,  Macie  calculates
          this  value based on the size of the latest version of each applica-
          ble object in those buckets. This value doesn't reflect the  storage
          size of all versions of all applicable objects in the buckets.

       lastUpdated -> (timestamp)
          The  date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when Amazon
          Macie most recently retrieved both bucket and object  metadata  from
          Amazon S3 for the buckets.

          The total number of objects in the buckets.

       sizeInBytes -> (long)
          The total storage size, in bytes, of the buckets.

          If versioning is enabled for any of the buckets, Amazon Macie calcu-
          lates this value based on the size of the latest version of each ob-
          ject  in  those buckets. This value doesn't reflect the storage size
          of all versions of the objects in the buckets.

       sizeInBytesCompressed -> (long)
          The total storage size, in bytes, of the objects that are compressed
          (.gz, .gzip, .zip) files in the buckets.

          If versioning is enabled for any of the buckets, Amazon Macie calcu-
          lates this value based on the size of the latest version of each ap-
          plicable  object  in  those  buckets. This value doesn't reflect the
          storage size of all versions of the applicable objects in the  buck-
          ets.

       unclassifiableObjectCount -> (structure)
          The  total  number of objects that Amazon Macie can't analyze in the
          buckets. These objects don't use a supported storage class or  don't
          have a file name extension for a supported file or storage format.

          fileType -> (long)
              The total storage size (in bytes) or number of objects that Ama-

              storage class.

          total -> (long)
              The total storage size (in bytes) or number of objects that Ama-
              zon Macie can't analyze because the objects use  an  unsupported

              ported file or storage format.

       unclassifiableObjectSizeInBytes -> (structure)
          The total storage size, in bytes, of the objects that  Amazon  Macie
          can't  analyze  in  the buckets. These objects don't use a supported
          storage class or don't have a file name extension  for  a  supported
          file or storage format.

          fileType -> (long)
              The total storage size (in bytes) or number of objects that Ama-
              zon Macie can't analyze because the objects don't  have  a  file
