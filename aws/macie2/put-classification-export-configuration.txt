NAME

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  or updates the configuration settings for storing data classi-
       fication results.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-classification-export-configuration
          --configuration <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --configuration (structure)
          The location to store data classification results in,  and  the  en-
          cryption settings to use when storing results in that location.

          s3Destination -> (structure)
              The  S3  bucket to store data classification results in, and the
              encryption settings to use when storing results in that bucket.

              bucketName -> (string)
                 The name of the bucket.

              keyPrefix -> (string)
                 The path prefix to use in the path to  the  location  in  the
                 bucket.  This  prefix specifies where to store classification
                 results in the bucket.

              kmsKeyArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key to use for  en-
                 cryption of the results. This must be the ARN of an existing,
                 symmetric, customer managed KMS key that's in the same Amazon
                 Web Services Region as the bucket.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          s3Destination={bucketName=string,keyPrefix=string,kmsKeyArn=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "s3Destination": {
              "bucketName": "string",
              "keyPrefix": "string",
              "kmsKeyArn": "string"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       configuration -> (structure)
          The  location  where the data classification results are stored, and
          the encryption settings that are used when storing results  in  that
          location.

          s3Destination -> (structure)
              The  S3  bucket to store data classification results in, and the
              encryption settings to use when storing results in that bucket.

              bucketName -> (string)
                 The name of the bucket.

              keyPrefix -> (string)
                 The path prefix to use in the path to  the  location  in  the
                 bucket.  This  prefix specifies where to store classification
                 results in the bucket.

              kmsKeyArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key to use for  en-
                 cryption of the results. This must be the ARN of an existing,
                 symmetric, customer managed KMS key that's in the same Amazon
                 Web Services Region as the bucket.
