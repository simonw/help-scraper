DESCRIBE-BUCKETS()                                          DESCRIBE-BUCKETS()



NAME
       describe-buckets -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves (queries) statistical data and other information about one or
       more S3 buckets that Amazon Macie monitors and analyzes.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-buckets is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: buckets

SYNOPSIS
            describe-buckets
          [--criteria <value>]
          [--sort-criteria <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --criteria (map)
          The criteria to use to filter the query results.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Specifies the operator to use in a property-based condition that
              filters the results of a query for information about S3 buckets.

              eq -> (list)
                 The value for the property  matches  (equals)  the  specified
                 value.  If  you specify multiple values, Amazon Macie uses OR
                 logic to join the values.

                 (string)

              gt -> (long)
                 The value for the property  is  greater  than  the  specified
                 value.

              gte -> (long)
                 The  value  for  the property is greater than or equal to the
                 specified value.

              lt -> (long)
                 The value for the property is less than the specified value.

              lte -> (long)
                 The value for the property is less than or equal to the spec-
                 ified value.

              neq -> (list)
                 The  value for the property doesn't match (doesn't equal) the
                 specified value. If you specify multiple values, Amazon Macie
                 uses OR logic to join the values.

                 (string)

              prefix -> (string)
                 The name of the bucket begins with the specified value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=eq=string,string,gt=long,gte=long,lt=long,lte=long,neq=string,string,prefix=string,KeyName2=eq=string,string,gt=long,gte=long,lt=long,lte=long,neq=string,string,prefix=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {
                "eq": ["string", ...],
                "gt": long,
                "gte": long,
                "lt": long,
                "lte": long,
                "neq": ["string", ...],
                "prefix": "string"
              }
            ...}

       --sort-criteria (structure)
          The criteria to use to sort the query results.

          attributeName -> (string)
              The  name  of  the  bucket property to sort the results by. This
              value can be one of the following properties that  Amazon  Macie
              defines  as  bucket  metadata:  accountId, bucketName, classifi-
              ableObjectCount,   classifiableSizeInBytes,   objectCount,    or
              sizeInBytes.

          orderBy -> (string)
              The sort order to apply to the results, based on the value spec-
              ified by the attributeName property. Valid values are: ASC, sort
              the  results  in ascending order; and, DESC, sort the results in
              descending order.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attributeName=string,orderBy=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attributeName": "string",
            "orderBy": "ASC"|"DESC"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       buckets -> (list)
          An  array of objects, one for each bucket that meets the filter cri-
          teria specified in the request.

          (structure)
              Provides statistical data and  other  information  about  an  S3
              bucket that Amazon Macie monitors and analyzes for your account.
              If an error occurs when Macie attempts to retrieve  and  process
              information  about the bucket or the bucket's objects, the value
              for the versioning property is false  and  the  value  for  most
              other  properties  is null. Exceptions are accountId, bucketArn,
              bucketCreatedAt, bucketName, lastUpdated, and region.  To  iden-
              tify  the  cause  of  the  error, refer to the errorCode and er-
              rorMessage values.

              accountId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the  Amazon  Web  Services  account
                 that owns the bucket.

              allowsUnencryptedObjectUploads -> (string)
                 Specifies  whether  the bucket policy for the bucket requires
                 server-side encryption of objects when objects  are  uploaded
                 to the bucket. Possible values are:

                 o FALSE  -  The bucket policy requires server-side encryption
                   of  new  objects.  PutObject  requests  must  include   the
                   x-amz-server-side-encryption  header and the value for that
                   header must be AES256 or aws:kms.

                 o TRUE - The bucket doesn't have a bucket policy or it has  a
                   bucket  policy  that doesn't require server-side encryption
                   of new objects. If a bucket policy exists, it  doesn't  re-
                   quire     PutObject     requests     to     include     the
                   x-amz-server-side-encryption header and it doesn't  require
                   the value for that header to be AES256 or aws:kms.

                 o UNKNOWN  -  Amazon Macie can't determine whether the bucket
                   policy requires server-side encryption of new objects.

              bucketArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the bucket.

              bucketCreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format,  when
                 the bucket was created.

              bucketName -> (string)
                 The name of the bucket.

              classifiableObjectCount -> (long)
                 The  total number of objects that Amazon Macie can analyze in
                 the bucket. These objects use a supported storage  class  and
                 have  a  file  name extension for a supported file or storage
                 format.

              classifiableSizeInBytes -> (long)
                 The total storage size, in bytes, of the objects that  Amazon
                 Macie  can  analyze  in  the bucket. These objects use a sup-
                 ported storage class and have a file  name  extension  for  a
                 supported file or storage format.

                 If  versioning  is  enabled  for the bucket, Macie calculates
                 this value based on the size of the latest  version  of  each
                 applicable  object  in the bucket. This value doesn't reflect
                 the storage size of all versions of each applicable object in
                 the bucket.

              errorCode -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  error code for an error that prevented Amazon
                 Macie from retrieving and processing  information  about  the
                 bucket  and the bucket's objects. If this value is ACCESS_DE-
                 NIED, Macie doesn't have permission to retrieve the  informa-
                 tion. For example, the bucket has a restrictive bucket policy
                 and Amazon S3 denied the request. If this value is null,  Ma-
                 cie was able to retrieve and process the information.

              errorMessage -> (string)
                 A  brief  description of the error (errorCode) that prevented
                 Amazon Macie from retrieving and processing information about
                 the  bucket  and  the bucket's objects. This value is null if
                 Macie was able to retrieve and process the information.

              jobDetails -> (structure)
                 Specifies whether any one-time  or  recurring  classification
                 jobs  are  configured  to analyze data in the bucket, and, if
                 so, the details of the job that ran most recently.

                 isDefinedInJob -> (string)
                     Specifies whether any one-time or recurring jobs are con-
                     figured  to  analyze  data in the bucket. Possible values
                     are:

                     o TRUE - The bucket is explicitly included in the  bucket
                       definition  (S3BucketDefinitionForJob)  for one or more
                       jobs and at least one of those jobs has a status  other
                       than CANCELLED. Or the bucket matched the bucket crite-
                       ria (S3BucketCriteriaForJob) for at least one job  that
                       previously ran.

                     o FALSE  -  The  bucket  isn't explicitly included in the
                       bucket definition  (S3BucketDefinitionForJob)  for  any
                       jobs,  all  the jobs that explicitly include the bucket
                       in their bucket definitions have a status of CANCELLED,
                       or the bucket didn't match the bucket criteria (S3Buck-
                       etCriteriaForJob) for any jobs that previously ran.

                     o UNKNOWN - An exception occurred when Amazon  Macie  at-
                       tempted to retrieve job data for the bucket.

                 isMonitoredByJob -> (string)
                     Specifies  whether  any  recurring jobs are configured to
                     analyze data in the bucket. Possible values are:

                     o TRUE - The bucket is explicitly included in the  bucket
                       definition  (S3BucketDefinitionForJob)  for one or more
                       recurring jobs or the bucket matches the bucket  crite-
                       ria  (S3BucketCriteriaForJob) for one or more recurring
                       jobs. At least one of those jobs  has  a  status  other
                       than CANCELLED.

                     o FALSE  -  The  bucket  isn't explicitly included in the
                       bucket definition  (S3BucketDefinitionForJob)  for  any
                       recurring  jobs,  the  bucket  doesn't match the bucket
                       criteria  (S3BucketCriteriaForJob)  for  any  recurring
                       jobs,  or all the recurring jobs that are configured to
                       analyze data in the bucket have a status of CANCELLED.

                     o UNKNOWN - An exception occurred when Amazon  Macie  at-
                       tempted to retrieve job data for the bucket.

                 lastJobId -> (string)
                     The  unique identifier for the job that ran most recently
                     and is configured to analyze data in the  bucket,  either
                     the  latest  run  of a recurring job or the only run of a
                     one-time job.

                     This value is typically null if the value for  the  isDe-
                     finedInJob property is FALSE or UNKNOWN.

                 lastJobRunTime -> (timestamp)
                     The  date  and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format,
                     when the job (lastJobId) started. If the job is a  recur-
                     ring  job,  this value indicates when the most recent run
                     started.

                     This value is typically null if the value for  the  isDe-
                     finedInJob property is FALSE or UNKNOWN.

              lastUpdated -> (timestamp)
                 The  date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when
                 Amazon Macie most recently retrieved both bucket  and  object
                 metadata from Amazon S3 for the bucket.

              objectCount -> (long)
                 The total number of objects in the bucket.

              objectCountByEncryptionType -> (structure)
                 The  total  number of objects that are in the bucket, grouped
                 by server-side encryption type. This includes a grouping that
                 reports  the total number of objects that aren't encrypted or
                 use client-side encryption.

                 customerManaged -> (long)
                     The total number of objects that  are  encrypted  with  a
                     customer-provided  key. The objects use customer-provided
                     server-side encryption (SSE-C).

                 kmsManaged -> (long)
                     The total number of objects that are  encrypted  with  an
                     KMS  key,  either an Amazon Web Services managed key or a
                     customer managed key.  The  objects  use  KMS  encryption
                     (SSE-KMS).

                 s3Managed -> (long)
                     The  total  number  of objects that are encrypted with an
                     Amazon S3 managed key. The objects use Amazon S3  managed
                     encryption (SSE-S3).

                 unencrypted -> (long)
                     The  total number of objects that aren't encrypted or use
                     client-side encryption.

                 unknown -> (long)
                     The total number of objects  that  Amazon  Macie  doesn't
                     have current encryption metadata for. Macie can't provide
                     current data about the encryption settings for these  ob-
                     jects.

              publicAccess -> (structure)
                 Specifies  whether  the  bucket is publicly accessible due to
                 the combination of permissions settings  that  apply  to  the
                 bucket, and provides information about those settings.

                 effectivePermission -> (string)
                     Specifies  whether  the bucket is publicly accessible due
                     to the combination of permissions settings that apply  to
                     the bucket. Possible values are:

                     o NOT_PUBLIC - The bucket isn't publicly accessible.

                     o PUBLIC - The bucket is publicly accessible.

                     o UNKNOWN  -  Amazon  Macie  can't  determine whether the
                       bucket is publicly accessible.

                 permissionConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The account-level and bucket-level  permissions  settings
                     for the bucket.

                     accountLevelPermissions -> (structure)
                        The  account-level  permissions settings that apply to
                        the bucket.

                        blockPublicAccess -> (structure)
                            The block public access settings  for  the  Amazon
                            Web Services account that owns the bucket.

                   access settings for the bucket.

              sizeInBytes -> (long)
                 The total storage size, in bytes, of the bucket.

                 If  versioning is enabled for the bucket, Amazon Macie calcu-
                 lates this value based on the size of the latest  version  of
                 each  object  in  the  bucket. This value doesn't reflect the
                 storage size of all versions of each object in the bucket.

                 compressed (.gz, .gzip, .zip) files in the bucket.

                 If  versioning is enabled for the bucket, Amazon Macie calcu-
                 lates this value based on the size of the latest  version  of
                 each  applicable object in the bucket. This value doesn't re-
                 flect the storage size of all versions of each applicable ob-
                 ject in the bucket.

              tags -> (list)

                     with  an  S3 bucket or object. Each tag consists of a re-
                     quired tag key and an associated tag value.

                     key -> (string)
                        One part of a key-value pair that comprises a  tag.  A

                 Macie can't analyze in the bucket. These objects don't use  a
                 supported  storage  class or don't have a file name extension
                 for a supported file or storage format.

                 fileType -> (long)
                     The total storage size (in bytes) or  number  of  objects
