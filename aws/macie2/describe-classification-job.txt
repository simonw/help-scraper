OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the classification job.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       allowListIds -> (list)
          An array of unique identifiers, one for each allow list that the job
          uses when it analyzes data.

          (string)

       clientToken -> (string)
          The token that was provided to ensure the idempotency of the request
          to create the job.

       createdAt -> (timestamp)
          The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when the job
          was created.

       customDataIdentifierIds -> (list)
          An  array of unique identifiers, one for each custom data identifier
          that the job uses when it analyzes data. This value is null  if  the
          job uses only managed data identifiers to analyze data.

          (string)

       description -> (string)
          The custom description of the job.

       initialRun -> (boolean)
          For a recurring job, specifies whether you configured the job to an-
          alyze all existing, eligible objects immediately after the  job  was
          created  (true). If you configured the job to analyze only those ob-
          jects that were created or changed after the job was created and be-
          fore  the job's first scheduled run, this value is false. This value
          is also false for a one-time job.

       jobArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job.

       jobId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the job.

       jobStatus -> (string)
          The current status of the job. Possible values are:

          o CANCELLED - You cancelled the job or, if it's a one-time job,  you
            paused the job and didn't resume it within 30 days.

          o COMPLETE  -  For  a one-time job, Amazon Macie finished processing
            the data specified for the job. This value doesn't apply to recur-
            ring jobs.

          o IDLE - For a recurring job, the previous scheduled run is complete
            and the next scheduled run is pending. This value doesn't apply to
            one-time jobs.

          o PAUSED  -  Macie started running the job but additional processing
            would exceed the monthly sensitive data discovery quota  for  your
            account  or one or more member accounts that the job analyzes data
            for.

          o RUNNING - For a one-time job, the job is in progress. For a recur-
            ring job, a scheduled run is in progress.

          o USER_PAUSED  -  You paused the job. If you paused the job while it
            had a status of RUNNING and you don't resume it within 30 days  of
            pausing  it,  the job or job run will expire and be cancelled, de-
            pending on the job's type. To check the expiration date, refer  to
            the UserPausedDetails.jobExpiresAt property.

       jobType -> (string)
          The schedule for running the job. Possible values are:

          o ONE_TIME - The job runs only once.

          o SCHEDULED - The job runs on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. The
            scheduleFrequency property indicates the  recurrence  pattern  for
            the job.

       lastRunErrorStatus -> (structure)
          Specifies  whether  any  account-  or bucket-level access errors oc-
          curred when the job ran. For a recurring job, this  value  indicates
          the error status of the job's most recent run.

          code -> (string)
              Specifies whether any account- or bucket-level access errors oc-
              curred when the job ran. For a recurring job, this  value  indi-
              cates  the  error  status of the job's most recent run. Possible
              values are:

              o ERROR - One or  more  errors  occurred.  Amazon  Macie  didn't
                process all the data specified for the job.

              o NONE - No errors occurred. Macie processed all the data speci-
                fied for the job.

       lastRunTime -> (timestamp)
          The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when the job
          started.  If  the  job is a recurring job, this value indicates when
          the most recent run started or, if the job hasn't run yet, when  the
          job was created.

       managedDataIdentifierIds -> (list)
          An array of unique identifiers, one for each managed data identifier
          that the job is explicitly configured to include  (use)  or  exclude
          (not  use)  when it analyzes data. Inclusion or exclusion depends on
          the managed data identifier selection type  specified  for  the  job
          (managedDataIdentifierSelector).  This  value  is  null if the job's
          managed data identifier selection type is ALL or the job  uses  only
          custom data identifiers (customDataIdentifierIds) to analyze data.

          (string)

       managedDataIdentifierSelector -> (string)
          The  selection  type  that determines which managed data identifiers
          the job uses to analyze data. Possible values are:

          o ALL - Use all the managed data identifiers that Amazon Macie  pro-
            vides.

          o EXCLUDE - Use all the managed data identifiers that Macie provides
            except the managed data  identifiers  specified  by  the  managed-
            DataIdentifierIds property.

          o INCLUDE  -  Use only the managed data identifiers specified by the
            managedDataIdentifierIds property.

          o NONE - Don't use any managed data identifiers.

          If this value is null, the job uses all managed data identifiers. If
          this  value  is  null,  ALL, or EXCLUDE for a recurring job, the job
          also uses new managed data identifiers as they are released.

       name -> (string)
          The custom name of the job.

       s3JobDefinition -> (structure)
          The S3 buckets that contain the objects to analyze, and the scope of
          that analysis.

          bucketDefinitions -> (list)
              An  array  of  objects, one for each Amazon Web Services account
              that owns specific S3 buckets to analyze. Each object  specifies
              the account ID for an account and one or more buckets to analyze
              for that account. A job's definition can contain a bucketDefini-
              tions array or a bucketCriteria object, not both.

              (structure)
                 Specifies an Amazon Web Services account that owns S3 buckets
                 for a classification job to analyze, and one or more specific
                 buckets to analyze for that account.

                 accountId -> (string)
                     The unique identifier for the Amazon Web Services account
                     that owns the buckets.

                 buckets -> (list)
                     An array that lists the names of the buckets.

                     (string)

          scoping -> (structure)
              The property- and tag-based conditions that determine  which  S3
              objects  to  include or exclude from the analysis. Each time the
              job runs, the job uses these criteria to determine which objects
              to analyze.

              excludes -> (structure)
                 The  property-  and tag-based conditions that determine which
                 objects to exclude from the analysis.

                 and -> (list)
                     An  array  of  conditions,  one  for  each  property-  or
                     tag-based  condition that determines which objects to in-
                     clude or exclude from the job. If you specify  more  than
                     one  condition,  Amazon  Macie uses AND logic to join the
                     conditions.

                     (structure)
                        Specifies a property- or tag-based condition that  de-
                        fines  criteria  for including or excluding S3 objects
                        from a classification job. A JobScopeTerm  object  can
                        contain   only   one  simpleScopeTerm  object  or  one
                        tagScopeTerm object.

                        simpleScopeTerm -> (structure)
                            A property-based condition that  defines  a  prop-
                            erty, operator, and one or more values for includ-
                            ing or excluding objects from the job.

                            comparator -> (string)
                               The operator to use  in  the  condition.  Valid
                               values for each supported property (key) are:

                               o OBJECT_EXTENSION  -  EQ  (equals)  or NE (not
                                 equals)

                               o OBJECT_KEY - STARTS_WITH

                               o OBJECT_LAST_MODIFIED_DATE - Any operator  ex-
                                 cept CONTAINS

                               o OBJECT_SIZE - Any operator except CONTAINS

                            key -> (string)
                               The object property to use in the condition.

                            values -> (list)
                               An  array  that  lists the values to use in the
                               condition. If the value for the key property is
                               OBJECT_EXTENSION  or OBJECT_KEY, this array can
                               specify multiple values and Amazon  Macie  uses
                               OR  logic  to  join the values. Otherwise, this
                               array can specify only one value.

                               Valid values for each supported property  (key)
                               are:

                               o OBJECT_EXTENSION  -  A string that represents
                                 the file name extension of an object. For ex-
                                 ample: docx or pdf

                               o OBJECT_KEY - A string that represents the key
                                 prefix (folder name or path)  of  an  object.
                                 For  example: logs or awslogs/eventlogs. This
                                 value applies a condition  to  objects  whose
                                 keys (names) begin with the specified value.

                               o OBJECT_LAST_MODIFIED_DATE - The date and time
                                 (in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format) when an
                                 object was created or last changed, whichever
                                 is latest. For example: 2020-09-28T14:31:13Z

                               o OBJECT_SIZE - An integer that represents  the
                                 storage size (in bytes) of an object.

                               Macie  doesn't  support use of wildcard charac-
                               ters in these values. Also, string  values  are
                               case sensitive.

                               (string)

                        tagScopeTerm -> (structure)
                            A  tag-based  condition  that defines the operator
                            and tag keys or tag key and value  pairs  for  in-
                            cluding or excluding objects from the job.

                            comparator -> (string)
                               The  operator  to  use  in the condition. Valid
                               values are EQ (equals) or NE (not equals).

                            key -> (string)
                               The object property to use  in  the  condition.
                               The only valid value is TAG.

                            tagValues -> (list)
                               The  tag keys or tag key and value pairs to use
                               in the condition. To specify only tag keys in a
                               condition,  specify  the keys in this array and
                               set the value for each associated tag value  to
                               an empty string.

                               (structure)
                                   Specifies  a  tag  key or tag key and value
                                   pair to use in a tag-based  condition  that
                                   determines whether an S3 object is included
                                   or excluded from a classification job.  Tag
                                   keys  and  values are case sensitive. Also,
                                   Amazon Macie doesn't support use of partial
                                   values  or wildcard characters in tag-based
                                   conditions.

                                   key -> (string)
                                      The value for the tag key to use in  the
                                      condition.

                                   value -> (string)
                                      The tag value, associated with the spec-
                                      ified tag key (key), to use in the  con-
                                      dition.  To specify only a tag key for a
                                      condition, specify the tag key  for  the
                                      key  property  and  set this value to an
                                      empty string.

                            target -> (string)

              includes -> (structure)
                 The property- and tag-based conditions that  determine  which
                 objects to include in the analysis.

                 and -> (list)
                     An  array  of  conditions,  one  for  each  property-  or
                     tag-based condition that determines which objects to  in-
                     clude  or  exclude from the job. If you specify more than
                     one condition, Amazon Macie uses AND logic  to  join  the
                     conditions.

                     (structure)
                        Specifies  a property- or tag-based condition that de-
                        fines criteria for including or excluding  S3  objects
                        from  a  classification job. A JobScopeTerm object can
                        contain  only  one  simpleScopeTerm  object   or   one
                        tagScopeTerm object.

                        simpleScopeTerm -> (structure)
                            A  property-based  condition  that defines a prop-
                            erty, operator, and one or more values for includ-
                            ing or excluding objects from the job.

                            comparator -> (string)
                               The  operator  to  use  in the condition. Valid
                               values for each supported property (key) are:

                               o OBJECT_EXTENSION - EQ  (equals)  or  NE  (not
                                 equals)

                               o OBJECT_KEY - STARTS_WITH

                               o OBJECT_LAST_MODIFIED_DATE  - Any operator ex-
                                 cept CONTAINS

                               o OBJECT_SIZE - Any operator except CONTAINS

                            key -> (string)
                               The object property to use in the condition.

                            values -> (list)
                               An array that lists the values to  use  in  the
                               condition. If the value for the key property is
                               OBJECT_EXTENSION or OBJECT_KEY, this array  can
                               specify  multiple  values and Amazon Macie uses
                               OR logic to join the  values.  Otherwise,  this
                               array can specify only one value.

                               Valid  values for each supported property (key)
                               are:

                               o OBJECT_EXTENSION - A string  that  represents
                                 the file name extension of an object. For ex-
                                 ample: docx or pdf

                               o OBJECT_KEY - A string that represents the key
                                 prefix  (folder  name  or path) of an object.
                                 For example: logs or awslogs/eventlogs.  This
                                 value  applies  a  condition to objects whose
                                 keys (names) begin with the specified value.

                               o OBJECT_LAST_MODIFIED_DATE - The date and time
                                 (in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format) when an
                                 object was created or last changed, whichever
                                 is latest. For example: 2020-09-28T14:31:13Z

                               o OBJECT_SIZE  - An integer that represents the
                                 storage size (in bytes) of an object.

                               Macie doesn't support use of  wildcard  charac-
                               ters  in  these values. Also, string values are
                               case sensitive.

                               (string)

                        tagScopeTerm -> (structure)
                            A tag-based condition that  defines  the  operator
                            and  tag  keys  or tag key and value pairs for in-
                            cluding or excluding objects from the job.

                            comparator -> (string)
                               The operator to use  in  the  condition.  Valid
                               values are EQ (equals) or NE (not equals).

                            key -> (string)
                               The  object  property  to use in the condition.
                               The only valid value is TAG.

                            tagValues -> (list)
                               The tag keys or tag key and value pairs to  use
                               in the condition. To specify only tag keys in a
                               condition, specify the keys in this  array  and
                               set  the value for each associated tag value to
                               an empty string.

                               (structure)
                                   Specifies a tag key or tag  key  and  value
                                   pair  to  use in a tag-based condition that
                                   determines whether an S3 object is included
                                   or  excluded from a classification job. Tag
                                   keys and values are case  sensitive.  Also,
                                   Amazon Macie doesn't support use of partial
                                   values or wildcard characters in  tag-based
                                   conditions.

                                   key -> (string)
                                      The  value for the tag key to use in the
                                      condition.

                                      ified  tag key (key), to use in the con-
                                      dition. To specify only a tag key for  a
                                      condition,  specify  the tag key for the
                                      key property and set this  value  to  an
                                      empty string.

                            target -> (string)
                               The type of object to apply the condition to.

          bucketCriteria -> (structure)
              The  property-  and tag-based conditions that determine which S3
              buckets to include or exclude from the analysis. Each  time  the
              job runs, the job uses these criteria to determine which buckets
              contain objects to analyze. A job's  definition  can  contain  a
              bucketCriteria object or a bucketDefinitions array, not both.

              excludes -> (structure)
                 The  property-  and tag-based conditions that determine which
                 buckets to exclude from the job.

                 and -> (list)
                     An array of conditions, one for each condition  that  de-
                     termines  which  buckets  to  include or exclude from the
                     job. If you specify more than one condition, Amazon Macie
                     uses AND logic to join the conditions.

                     (structure)
                        Specifies  a property- or tag-based condition that de-
                        fines criteria for including or excluding  S3  buckets
                        from a classification job.

                            A  property-based  condition  that defines a prop-
                            erty, operator, and one or more values for includ-
                            ing or excluding buckets from the job.

                            comparator -> (string)

                               An array that lists one or more values  to  use
                               in  the condition. If you specify multiple val-
                               ues, Amazon Macie uses OR  logic  to  join  the
                               values.  Valid  values for each supported prop-
                               erty (key) are:

                               Values  are case sensitive. Also, Macie doesn't
                               support use of partial values or wildcard char-
                               acters in these values.

                                   Specifies  a tag key, a tag value, or a tag
                                   key and value (as  a  pair)  to  use  in  a
                                   tag-based condition that determines whether
                                   an S3 bucket is included or excluded from a
                                   classification job. Tag keys and values are
                                   case sensitive. Also, Amazon Macie  doesn't
                                   support  use  of partial values or wildcard
                                   characters in tag-based conditions.

                                   key -> (string)
                                      The value for the tag key to use in  the
                                      condition.

                                   value -> (string)
                                      The tag value to use in the condition.

       samplingPercentage -> (integer)
          The  sampling depth, as a percentage, that determines the percentage
          of eligible objects that the job analyzes.

       scheduleFrequency -> (structure)
          The recurrence pattern for running the job. This value  is  null  if
          the job is configured to run only once.

          dailySchedule -> (structure)
              Specifies a daily recurrence pattern for running the job.

          monthlySchedule -> (structure)
              Specifies a monthly recurrence pattern for running the job.

              dayOfMonth -> (integer)
                 The  numeric day of the month when Amazon Macie runs the job.
                 This value can be an integer from 1 through 31.

                 If this value exceeds the number of days in a certain  month,
                 Macie doesn't run the job that month. Macie runs the job only
                 during months that have the specified day.  For  example,  if
                 this  value is 31 and a month has only 30 days, Macie doesn't
                 run the job that month. To run the job every month, specify a
                 value that's less than 29.

       statistics -> (structure)
          The  number  of times that the job has run and processing statistics
          for the job's current run.

          approximateNumberOfObjectsToProcess -> (double)
              The approximate number of  objects  that  the  job  has  yet  to
              process during its current run.

          numberOfRuns -> (double)
              The number of times that the job has run.

       tags -> (map)
          A map of key-value pairs that specifies which tags (keys and values)
          are associated with the classification job.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       userPausedDetails -> (structure)
          If the current status of the job is USER_PAUSED, specifies when  the
          job  was  paused and when the job or job run will expire and be can-
          celled if it isn't resumed. This value is present only if the  value
          for jobStatus is USER_PAUSED.

          jobExpiresAt -> (timestamp)
              The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when the
              job or job run will expire and be cancelled if you don't  resume
              it first.

          jobImminentExpirationHealthEventArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Health event that Amazon
              Macie sent to notify you of the job or job run's pending expira-
              tion  and  cancellation.  This  value  is null if a job has been
              paused for less than 23 days.

          jobPausedAt -> (timestamp)
              The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when you
              paused the job.
