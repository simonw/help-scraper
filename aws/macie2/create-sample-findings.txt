       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-sample-findings
          [--finding-types <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --finding-types (list)
          An  array  of  finding types, one for each type of sample finding to
          create. To create a sample of every type of finding that Amazon  Ma-
          cie supports, don't include this array in your request.

          (string)
              The  type  of finding. For details about each type, see Types of
              Amazon Macie findings in the Amazon Macie  User  Guide  .  Valid
              values are:

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            SensitiveData:S3Object/Multiple
            SensitiveData:S3Object/Financial
            SensitiveData:S3Object/Personal
            SensitiveData:S3Object/Credentials
            SensitiveData:S3Object/CustomIdentifier
            Policy:IAMUser/S3BucketPublic
            Policy:IAMUser/S3BucketSharedExternally
            Policy:IAMUser/S3BucketReplicatedExternally
            Policy:IAMUser/S3BucketEncryptionDisabled
            Policy:IAMUser/S3BlockPublicAccessDisabled

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
