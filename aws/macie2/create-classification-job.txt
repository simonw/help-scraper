OPTIONS
       --allow-list-ids (list)
          An  array of unique identifiers, one for each allow list for the job
          to use when it analyzes data.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --client-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive token that you provide to ensure the  idem-
          potency of the request.

       --custom-data-identifier-ids (list)
          An  array of unique identifiers, one for each custom data identifier
          for the job to use when it analyzes data. To use only  managed  data
          identifiers,  don't  specify a value for this property and specify a
          value other than NONE for  the  managedDataIdentifierSelector  prop-
          erty.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --description (string)
          A custom description of the job. The description can contain as many
          as 200 characters.

       --initial-run | --no-initial-run (boolean)
          For a recurring job, specifies whether to analyze all existing, eli-
          gible  objects  immediately after the job is created (true). To ana-
          lyze only those objects that are created or changed after you create
          the  job and before the job's first scheduled run, set this value to
          false.

          If you configure the job to run only once, don't specify a value for
          this property.

       --job-type (string)
          The schedule for running the job. Valid values are:

          o ONE_TIME - Run the job only once. If you specify this value, don't
            specify a value for the scheduleFrequency property.

          o SCHEDULED - Run the job on a daily, weekly, or monthly  basis.  If
            you  specify  this  value,  use  the scheduleFrequency property to
            specify the recurrence pattern for the job.

          Possible values:

          o ONE_TIME

          o SCHEDULED

       --managed-data-identifier-ids (list)
          An array of unique identifiers, one for each managed data identifier
          for  the  job to include (use) or exclude (not use) when it analyzes
          data. Inclusion or exclusion depends on the managed data  identifier
          selection type that you specify for the job (managedDataIdentifierS-
          elector).

          To retrieve a list of valid values for this property, use the  List-
          ManagedDataIdentifiers operation.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --managed-data-identifier-selector (string)
          The  selection  type  to  apply  when determining which managed data
          identifiers the job uses to analyze data. Valid values are:

          o ALL - Use all managed data identifiers. If you specify this value,
            don't  specify  any  values for the managedDataIdentifierIds prop-
            erty.

          o EXCLUDE - Use all managed data identifiers except the ones  speci-
            fied by the managedDataIdentifierIds property.

          o INCLUDE  -  Use only the managed data identifiers specified by the
            managedDataIdentifierIds property.

          o NONE - Don't use any managed data identifiers. If you specify this
            value,  specify at least one value for the customDataIdentifierIds
            property and don't specify any values for  the  managedDataIdenti-
            fierIds property.

          o RECOMMENDED  (default)  -  Use the recommended set of managed data
            identifiers. If you specify this value, don't specify  any  values
            for the managedDataIdentifierIds property.

          If  you  don't  specify  a value for this property, the job uses the
          recommended set of managed data identifiers.

          If the job is a recurring job and you specify ALL or  EXCLUDE,  each
          job run automatically uses new managed data identifiers that are re-
          leased. If you don't specify a value for this property or you  spec-
          ify RECOMMENDED for a recurring job, each job run automatically uses
          all the managed data identifiers that are  in  the  recommended  set
          when the run starts.

          To  learn  about  individual  managed  data identifiers or determine
          which ones are in the recommended set, see Using managed data  iden-
          tifiers  or Recommended managed data identifiers in the Amazon Macie
          User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o ALL

          o EXCLUDE

          o INCLUDE

          o NONE

          o RECOMMENDED

       --name (string)
          A custom name for the job. The name can contain as many as 500 char-
          acters.

       --s3-job-definition (structure)
          The S3 buckets that contain the objects to analyze, and the scope of
          that analysis.

          bucketCriteria -> (structure)
              The property- and tag-based conditions that determine  which  S3
              buckets  to  include or exclude from the analysis. Each time the
              job runs, the job uses these criteria to determine which buckets
              contain  objects  to  analyze.  A job's definition can contain a
              bucketCriteria object or a bucketDefinitions array, not both.

              excludes -> (structure)
                 The property- and tag-based conditions that  determine  which
                 buckets to exclude from the job.

                 and -> (list)
                     An  array  of conditions, one for each condition that de-
                     termines which buckets to include  or  exclude  from  the
                     job. If you specify more than one condition, Amazon Macie
                     uses AND logic to join the conditions.

                     (structure)
                        Specifies a property- or tag-based condition that  de-
                        fines  criteria  for including or excluding S3 buckets
                        from a classification job.

                        simpleCriterion -> (structure)
                            A property-based condition that  defines  a  prop-
                            erty, operator, and one or more values for includ-
                            ing or excluding buckets from the job.

                            comparator -> (string)
                               The operator to use  in  the  condition.  Valid
                               values are EQ (equals) and NE (not equals).

                            key -> (string)
                               The property to use in the condition.

                            values -> (list)
                               An  array  that lists one or more values to use
                               in the condition. If you specify multiple  val-
                               ues,  Amazon  Macie  uses  OR logic to join the
                               values. Valid values for each  supported  prop-
                               erty (key) are:

                               o ACCOUNT_ID  -  A  string  that represents the
                                 unique identifier for the Amazon Web Services
                                 account that owns the bucket.

                               o S3_BUCKET_EFFECTIVE_PERMISSION   -  A  string
                                 that represents an enumerated value that  Ma-
                                 cie          defines          for         the
                                 BucketPublicAccess.effectivePermission  prop-
                                 erty of a bucket.

                               o S3_BUCKET_NAME - A string that represents the
                                 name of a bucket.

                               o S3_BUCKET_SHARED_ACCESS - A string that  rep-
                                 resents  an  enumerated  value that Macie de-

                                 property of a bucket.

                               Values  are case sensitive. Also, Macie doesn't
                               support use of partial values or wildcard char-
                               acters in these values.

                                      condition.

                                   value -> (string)
                                      The tag value to use in the condition.

          bucketDefinitions -> (list)
              An array of objects, one for each Amazon  Web  Services  account
              that  owns specific S3 buckets to analyze. Each object specifies
              the account ID for an account and one or more buckets to analyze
              for that account. A job's definition can contain a bucketDefini-
              tions array or a bucketCriteria object, not both.

              (structure)
                 Specifies an Amazon Web Services account that owns S3 buckets
                 for a classification job to analyze, and one or more specific
                 buckets to analyze for that account.

                 accountId -> (string)
                     The unique identifier for the Amazon Web Services account
                     that owns the buckets.

                 buckets -> (list)
                     An array that lists the names of the buckets.

                     (string)

          scoping -> (structure)
              The  property-  and tag-based conditions that determine which S3
              objects to include or exclude from the analysis. Each  time  the
              job runs, the job uses these criteria to determine which objects
              to analyze.

              excludes -> (structure)
                 The property- and tag-based conditions that  determine  which
                 objects to exclude from the analysis.

                 and -> (list)
                     An  array  of  conditions,  one  for  each  property-  or
                     tag-based condition that determines which objects to  in-
                     clude  or  exclude from the job. If you specify more than
                     one condition, Amazon Macie uses AND logic  to  join  the
                     conditions.

                     (structure)
                        Specifies  a property- or tag-based condition that de-
                        fines criteria for including or excluding  S3  objects
                        from  a  classification job. A JobScopeTerm object can
                        contain  only  one  simpleScopeTerm  object   or   one
                        tagScopeTerm object.

                        simpleScopeTerm -> (structure)
                            A  property-based  condition  that defines a prop-
                            erty, operator, and one or more values for includ-
                            ing or excluding objects from the job.

                            comparator -> (string)
                               The  operator  to  use  in the condition. Valid
                               values for each supported property (key) are:

                               o OBJECT_EXTENSION - EQ  (equals)  or  NE  (not
                                 equals)

                               o OBJECT_KEY - STARTS_WITH

                               o OBJECT_LAST_MODIFIED_DATE  -  EQ (equals), GT
                                 (greater than), GTE (greater than or equals),
                                 LT (less than), LTE (less than or equals), or
                                 NE (not equals)

                               o OBJECT_SIZE - EQ (equals), GT (greater than),
                                 GTE (greater than or equals), LT (less than),
                                 LTE (less than or equals), or NE (not equals)

                            key -> (string)
                               The object property to use in the condition.

                            values -> (list)
                               An array that lists the values to  use  in  the
                               condition. If the value for the key property is
                               OBJECT_EXTENSION or OBJECT_KEY, this array  can
                               specify  multiple  values and Amazon Macie uses
                               OR logic to join the  values.  Otherwise,  this
                               array can specify only one value.

                               Valid  values for each supported property (key)
                               are:

                               o OBJECT_EXTENSION - A string  that  represents
                                 the file name extension of an object. For ex-
                                 ample: docx or pdf

                               o OBJECT_KEY - A string that represents the key
                                 prefix  (folder  name  or path) of an object.
                                 For example: logs or awslogs/eventlogs.  This
                                 value  applies  a  condition to objects whose
                                 keys (names) begin with the specified value.

                               o OBJECT_LAST_MODIFIED_DATE - The date and time
                                 (in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format) when an
                                 object was created or last changed, whichever
                                 is latest. For example: 2023-09-24T14:31:13Z

                               o OBJECT_SIZE  - An integer that represents the
                                 storage size (in bytes) of an object.

                               Macie doesn't support use of  wildcard  charac-
                               ters  in  these values. Also, string values are
                               case sensitive.

                               (string)

                        tagScopeTerm -> (structure)
                            A tag-based condition that  defines  the  operator
                            and  tag  keys  or tag key and value pairs for in-
                            cluding or excluding objects from the job.

                               The  object  property  to use in the condition.
                               The only valid value is TAG.

                            tagValues -> (list)
                               The tag keys or tag key and value pairs to  use
                               in the condition. To specify only tag keys in a
                               condition, specify the keys in this  array  and
                               set  the value for each associated tag value to
                               an empty string.

                               (structure)

                                   determines whether an S3 object is included
                                   or  excluded from a classification job. Tag
                                   keys and values are case  sensitive.  Also,
                                   Amazon Macie doesn't support use of partial
                                   values or wildcard characters in  tag-based
                                   conditions.

                                   key -> (string)
                                      The  value for the tag key to use in the
                                      condition.

                                      ified  tag key (key), to use in the con-
                                      dition. To specify only a tag key for  a
                                      condition,  specify  the tag key for the
                                      key property and set this  value  to  an
                                      empty string.

                            target -> (string)
                               The type of object to apply the condition to.

              includes -> (structure)
                 The  property-  and tag-based conditions that determine which
                 objects to include in the analysis.

                 and -> (list)
                     An  array  of  conditions,  one  for  each  property-  or
                     tag-based  condition that determines which objects to in-
                     clude or exclude from the job. If you specify  more  than
                     one  condition,  Amazon  Macie uses AND logic to join the
                     conditions.

                     (structure)
                        Specifies a property- or tag-based condition that  de-
                        fines  criteria  for including or excluding S3 objects
                        from a classification job. A JobScopeTerm  object  can
                        contain   only   one  simpleScopeTerm  object  or  one
                        tagScopeTerm object.

                        simpleScopeTerm -> (structure)
                            A property-based condition that  defines  a  prop-
                            erty, operator, and one or more values for includ-
                            ing or excluding objects from the job.

                               condition. If the value for the key property is
                               OBJECT_EXTENSION  or OBJECT_KEY, this array can
                               specify multiple values and Amazon  Macie  uses
                               OR  logic  to  join the values. Otherwise, this
                               array can specify only one value.

                               Valid values for each supported property  (key)
                               are:

                                   values  or wildcard characters in tag-based
                                   conditions.

                                   key -> (string)
                                      The value for the tag key to use in  the
                                      condition.

                                   value -> (string)
                                      The tag value, associated with the spec-
                                      ified tag key (key), to use in the  con-
                                      dition.  To specify only a tag key for a
                                      condition, specify the tag key  for  the
                                      key  property  and  set this value to an
                                      empty string.

                            target -> (string)
                               The type of object to apply the condition to.

       --sampling-percentage (integer)
          The sampling depth, as a percentage, for the job to apply when  pro-
          cessing  objects.  This  value determines the percentage of eligible
          objects that the job analyzes. If this value is less than 100,  Ama-
          zon Macie selects the objects to analyze at random, up to the speci-
          fied percentage, and analyzes all the data in those objects.

       --schedule-frequency (structure)
          The recurrence pattern for running the job.  To  run  the  job  only
          once,  don't specify a value for this property and set the value for
          the jobType property to ONE_TIME.

          dailySchedule -> (structure)
              Specifies a daily recurrence pattern for running the job.

          monthlySchedule -> (structure)
              Specifies a monthly recurrence pattern for running the job.

              dayOfMonth -> (integer)
                 The numeric day of the month when Amazon Macie runs the  job.
                 This value can be an integer from 1 through 31.

                 If  this value exceeds the number of days in a certain month,
                 Macie doesn't run the job that month. Macie runs the job only
                 during  months  that  have the specified day. For example, if
                 this value is 31 and a month has only 30 days, Macie  doesn't
                 run the job that month. To run the job every month, specify a
                 value that's less than 29.

          weeklySchedule -> (structure)
              Specifies a weekly recurrence pattern for running the job.

              dayOfWeek -> (string)
                 The day of the week when Amazon Macie runs the job.

       --tags (map)
          A map of key-value pairs that specifies the tags to  associate  with
          the job.

          A  job can have a maximum of 50 tags. Each tag consists of a tag key
          and an associated tag value. The maximum length of a tag key is  128
          characters. The maximum length of a tag value is 256 characters.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
