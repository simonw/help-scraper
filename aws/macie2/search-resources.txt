SEARCH-RESOURCES()                                          SEARCH-RESOURCES()



NAME
       search-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves (queries) statistical data and other information about Amazon
       Web Services resources that Amazon Macie monitors and analyzes.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       search-resources is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: matchingResources

OPTIONS
       --bucket-criteria (structure)
          The  filter conditions that determine which S3 buckets to include or
          exclude from the query results.

          excludes -> (structure)
              The property- and  tag-based  conditions  that  determine  which
              buckets to exclude from the results.

              and -> (list)
                 An array of objects, one for each property- or tag-based con-
                 dition that includes or excludes resources from the query re-
                 sults.  If  you specify more than one condition, Amazon Macie
                 uses AND logic to join the conditions.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies a property- or tag-based filter  condition  for
                     including or excluding Amazon Web Services resources from
                     the query results.

                     simpleCriterion -> (structure)
                        A property-based condition that  defines  a  property,
                        operator,  and one or more values for including or ex-
                        cluding resources from the results.

                        comparator -> (string)
                            The operator to use in the condition. Valid values
                            are EQ (equals) and NE (not equals).

                        key -> (string)
                            The property to use in the condition.

                        values -> (list)
                            An  array  that lists one or more values to use in
                            the condition. If  you  specify  multiple  values,
                            Amazon  Macie  uses  OR  logic to join the values.
                            Valid values for  each  supported  property  (key)
                            are:

                            o ACCOUNT_ID - A string that represents the unique
                              identifier for the Amazon Web  Services  account
                              that owns the resource.

                            o S3_BUCKET_EFFECTIVE_PERMISSION  -  A string that
                              represents an enumerated value  that  Macie  de-
                              fines                   for                  the
                              BucketPublicAccess.effectivePermission  property
                              of an S3 bucket.

                            o S3_BUCKET_NAME  -  A  string that represents the
                              name of an S3 bucket.

                            o S3_BUCKET_SHARED_ACCESS - A string  that  repre-
                              sents an enumerated value that Macie defines for
                              the BucketMetadata.sharedAccess property  of  an
                              S3 bucket.

                            Values  are  case  sensitive.  Also, Macie doesn't
                            support use of partial values or wildcard  charac-
                            ters in values.

                               and value (as a pair) to  use  in  a  tag-based
                               filter condition for a query. Tag keys and val-
                               ues are  case  sensitive.  Also,  Amazon  Macie
                               doesn't  support use of partial values or wild-
                               card characters in tag-based filter conditions.

                 dition that includes or excludes resources from the query re-
                 sults. If you specify more than one condition,  Amazon  Macie
                 uses AND logic to join the conditions.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies  a  property- or tag-based filter condition for
                     including or excluding Amazon Web Services resources from

                               ues  are  case  sensitive.  Also,  Amazon Macie
                               doesn't support use of partial values or  wild-

          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

OUTPUT
       matchingResources -> (list)
          An  array  of objects, one for each resource that matches the filter
          criteria specified in the request.

          (structure)
              Provides statistical data and other information about an  Amazon
              Web  Services  resource  that Amazon Macie monitors and analyzes
              for your account.

              matchingBucket -> (structure)
                 The details of an S3 bucket that Amazon  Macie  monitors  and
                 analyzes.

                 accountId -> (string)
                     The unique identifier for the Amazon Web Services account
                     that owns the bucket.

                 bucketName -> (string)
                     The name of the bucket.

                 classifiableObjectCount -> (long)
                     The total number of objects that Amazon Macie can analyze
                     in  the  bucket.  These  objects  use a supported storage
                     class and have a file name extension for a supported file
                     or storage format.

                 classifiableSizeInBytes -> (long)
                     The  total  storage  size,  in bytes, of the objects that
                     Amazon Macie can analyze in the bucket. These objects use
                     a  supported storage class and have a file name extension
                     for a supported file or storage format.

                     If versioning is enabled for the bucket, Macie calculates
                     this  value  based  on  the size of the latest version of
                     each applicable object in the bucket. This value  doesn't
                     reflect the storage size of all versions of each applica-
                     ble object in the bucket.

                 errorCode -> (string)
                     The error code for an error that prevented  Amazon  Macie
                     from  retrieving  and  processing  information  about the
                     bucket and the bucket's objects. If  this  value  is  AC-
                     CESS_DENIED,  Macie  doesn't  have permission to retrieve
                     the information. For example, the bucket has  a  restric-
                     tive  bucket  policy and Amazon S3 denied the request. If
                     this value is  null,  Macie  was  able  to  retrieve  and
                     process the information.

                 errorMessage -> (string)
                     A  brief  description  of the error (errorCode) that pre-
                     vented Amazon Macie from retrieving and processing infor-
                     mation  about  the  bucket and the bucket's objects. This
                     value is null if Macie was able to retrieve  and  process
                     the information.

                 jobDetails -> (structure)
                     Specifies  whether  any one-time or recurring classifica-
                     tion jobs  are  configured  to  analyze  objects  in  the
                     bucket,  and, if so, the details of the job that ran most
                     recently.

                     isDefinedInJob -> (string)
                        Specifies whether any one-time or recurring  jobs  are
                        configured  to  analyze  data  in the bucket. Possible
                        values are:

                        o TRUE - The bucket  is  explicitly  included  in  the
                          bucket definition (S3BucketDefinitionForJob) for one
                          or more jobs and at least one of those  jobs  has  a
                          status  other  than CANCELLED. Or the bucket matched
                          the bucket criteria (S3BucketCriteriaForJob) for  at
                          least one job that previously ran.

                        o FALSE  - The bucket isn't explicitly included in the
                          bucket definition (S3BucketDefinitionForJob) for any
                          jobs,  all  the  jobs  that  explicitly  include the
                          bucket in their bucket definitions have a status  of
                          CANCELLED,  or  the  bucket  didn't match the bucket
                          criteria (S3BucketCriteriaForJob) for any jobs  that
                          previously ran.

                        o UNKNOWN  -  An  exception occurred when Amazon Macie
                          attempted to retrieve job data for the bucket.

                     isMonitoredByJob -> (string)
                        Specifies whether any recurring jobs are configured to
                        analyze data in the bucket. Possible values are:

                        o TRUE  -  The  bucket  is  explicitly included in the
                          bucket definition (S3BucketDefinitionForJob) for one
                          or  more  recurring  jobs  or the bucket matches the
                          bucket criteria (S3BucketCriteriaForJob) for one  or
                          more  recurring jobs. At least one of those jobs has
                          a status other than CANCELLED.

                        o FALSE - The bucket isn't explicitly included in  the
                          bucket definition (S3BucketDefinitionForJob) for any
                          recurring jobs, the bucket doesn't match the  bucket
                          criteria  (S3BucketCriteriaForJob) for any recurring
                          jobs, or all the recurring jobs that are  configured
                          to  analyze data in the bucket have a status of CAN-
                          CELLED.

                        o UNKNOWN - An exception occurred  when  Amazon  Macie
                          attempted to retrieve job data for the bucket.

                     lastJobId -> (string)
                        The  unique  identifier  for the job that ran most re-
                        cently and  is  configured  to  analyze  data  in  the
                        bucket,  either  the  latest run of a recurring job or
                        the only run of a one-time job.

                        This value is typically null if the value for the  is-
                        DefinedInJob property is FALSE or UNKNOWN.

                     lastJobRunTime -> (timestamp)
                        The  date  and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 for-
                        mat, when the job (lastJobId) started. If the job is a
                        recurring  job, this value indicates when the most re-
                        cent run started.

                        This value is typically null if the value for the  is-
                        DefinedInJob property is FALSE or UNKNOWN.

                 lastAutomatedDiscoveryTime -> (timestamp)
                     The  date  and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format,
                     when Amazon Macie most  recently  analyzed  data  in  the
                     bucket  while performing automated sensitive data discov-
                     ery for your account. This value  is  null  if  automated
                     sensitive  data  discovery is currently disabled for your
                     account.

                 objectCount -> (long)
                     The total number of objects in the bucket.

                 objectCountByEncryptionType -> (structure)
                     The total number of objects in  the  bucket,  grouped  by
                     server-side  encryption  type.  This  includes a grouping
                     that reports the total number of objects that aren't  en-
                     crypted or use client-side encryption.

                     customerManaged -> (long)
                        The  total  number  of objects that are encrypted with
                        customer-provided keys. The  objects  use  server-side
                        encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C).

                     kmsManaged -> (long)
                        The  total  number  of objects that are encrypted with
                        KMS keys, either Amazon Web Services managed  keys  or
                        customer  managed  keys.  The  objects  use dual-layer
                        server-side encryption or server-side encryption  with
                        KMS keys (DSSE-KMS or SSE-KMS).

                     s3Managed -> (long)
                        The  total  number  of objects that are encrypted with
                        Amazon S3 managed keys. The  objects  use  server-side
                        encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).

                     unencrypted -> (long)
                        The  total  number of objects that use client-side en-
                        cryption or aren't encrypted.

                     unknown -> (long)
                        The total number of objects that Amazon Macie  doesn't
                        have current encryption metadata for. Macie can't pro-
                        vide current data about the  encryption  settings  for
                        these objects.

                 sensitivityScore -> (integer)
                     The  current  sensitivity  score  for the bucket, ranging
                     from -1 (classification error) to 100  (sensitive).  This
                     value  is  null  if automated sensitive data discovery is
                     currently disabled for your account.

                 sizeInBytes -> (long)
                     The total storage size, in bytes, of the bucket.

                     If versioning is enabled for  the  bucket,  Amazon  Macie
                     calculates  this  value  based  on the size of the latest
                     version of each object in the bucket. This value  doesn't
                     reflect  the  storage size of all versions of each object
                     in the bucket.

                 sizeInBytesCompressed -> (long)
                     The total storage size, in bytes, of the objects that are
                     compressed (.gz, .gzip, .zip) files in the bucket.

                     If  versioning  is  enabled  for the bucket, Amazon Macie
                     calculates this value based on the  size  of  the  latest
                     version  of  each  applicable  object in the bucket. This
                     value doesn't reflect the storage size of all versions of
                     each applicable object in the bucket.

                 unclassifiableObjectCount -> (structure)
                     The  total number of objects that Amazon Macie can't ana-
                     lyze in the bucket. These objects don't use  a  supported
                     storage  class  or don't have a file name extension for a
                     supported file or storage format.

                     fileType -> (long)
                        The total storage size (in bytes) or number of objects
                        that  Amazon  Macie  can't analyze because the objects
                        don't have a file name extension for a supported  file
                        or storage format.

                     storageClass -> (long)
                        The total storage size (in bytes) or number of objects
                        that Amazon Macie can't analyze  because  the  objects
                        use an unsupported storage class.

                     total -> (long)
                        The total storage size (in bytes) or number of objects
                        that Amazon Macie can't analyze  because  the  objects
                        use  an unsupported storage class or don't have a file
                        name extension for a supported file or storage format.

                 unclassifiableObjectSizeInBytes -> (structure)
                     The total storage size, in bytes,  of  the  objects  that
                     Amazon  Macie  can't analyze in the bucket. These objects
                     don't use a supported storage class or don't have a  file
                     name extension for a supported file or storage format.

                     fileType -> (long)
                        The total storage size (in bytes) or number of objects
                        that Amazon Macie can't analyze  because  the  objects
                        don't  have a file name extension for a supported file
                        or storage format.

                     storageClass -> (long)
                        The total storage size (in bytes) or number of objects

                        name extension for a supported file or storage format.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  string  to  use in a subsequent request to get the next page of
          results in a paginated response. This value is null if there are  no
