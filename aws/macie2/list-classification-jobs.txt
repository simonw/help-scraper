LIST-CLASSIFICATION-JOBS()                          LIST-CLASSIFICATION-JOBS()



NAME
       list-classification-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  subset  of  information  about one or more classification
       jobs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-classification-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: items

OPTIONS
       --filter-criteria (structure)
          The criteria to use to filter the results.

          excludes -> (list)
              An  array  of  objects,  one  for each condition that determines
              which jobs to exclude from the results.

              (structure)
                 Specifies a condition that filters the results of  a  request
                 for  information  about  classification  jobs. Each condition
                 consists of a property, an operator, and one or more values.

                 comparator -> (string)
                     The operator to use to filter the results.

                 key -> (string)

          includes -> (list)
              An  array  of  objects,  one  for each condition that determines
              which jobs to include in the results.

              (structure)
                 Specifies a condition that filters the results of  a  request
                 for  information  about  classification  jobs. Each condition
                 consists of a property, an operator, and one or more values.

                 comparator -> (string)
                     The operator to use to filter the results.

                 key -> (string)
                     The property to use to filter the results.

                 values -> (list)
                     An array that lists one or more values to use  to  filter
                     the results.

                     (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "excludes": [
              {
                "comparator": "EQ"|"GT"|"GTE"|"LT"|"LTE"|"NE"|"CONTAINS"|"STARTS_WITH",
                "key": "jobType"|"jobStatus"|"createdAt"|"name",
                "values": ["string", ...]
              }
              ...
            ],
            "includes": [
              {
                "comparator": "EQ"|"GT"|"GTE"|"LT"|"LTE"|"NE"|"CONTAINS"|"STARTS_WITH",
                "key": "jobType"|"jobStatus"|"createdAt"|"name",
                "values": ["string", ...]
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --sort-criteria (structure)
          The criteria to use to sort the results.

          attributeName -> (string)
              The property to sort the results by.

          orderBy -> (string)
              The  sort  order to apply to the results, based on the value for
              the property specified by the attributeName property. Valid val-
              ues  are:  ASC,  sort the results in ascending order; and, DESC,
              sort the results in descending order.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attributeName=string,orderBy=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attributeName": "createdAt"|"jobStatus"|"name"|"jobType",
            "orderBy": "ASC"|"DESC"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       items -> (list)
          An array of objects, one for each job that meets the filter criteria
          specified in the request.

          (structure)
              Provides  information  about a classification job, including the
              current status of the job.

              bucketDefinitions -> (list)
                 An array of objects, one for each Amazon Web Services account
                 that  owns  specific  S3 buckets for the job to analyze. Each
                 object specifies the account ID for an  account  and  one  or
                 more  buckets to analyze for that account. A job's definition
                 can contain a bucketDefinitions array or a bucketCriteria ob-
                 ject, not both.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies  an  Amazon  Web  Services account that owns S3
                     buckets for a classification job to analyze, and  one  or
                     more specific buckets to analyze for that account.

                     accountId -> (string)
                        The  unique identifier for the Amazon Web Services ac-
                        count that owns the buckets.

                     buckets -> (list)
                        An array that lists the names of the buckets.

                        (string)

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format,  when
                 the job was created.

              jobId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the job.

              jobStatus -> (string)
                 The current status of the job. Possible values are:

                 o CANCELLED  -  You  cancelled the job or, if it's a one-time
                   job, you paused the job and  didn't  resume  it  within  30
                   days.

                 o COMPLETE  -  For a one-time job, Amazon Macie finished pro-
                   cessing the data specified for the job. This value  doesn't
                   apply to recurring jobs.

                 o IDLE  -  For a recurring job, the previous scheduled run is
                   complete and the next scheduled run is pending. This  value
                   doesn't apply to one-time jobs.

                 o PAUSED  - Macie started running the job but additional pro-
                   cessing would exceed the monthly sensitive  data  discovery
                   quota  for your account or one or more member accounts that
                   the job analyzes data for.

                 o RUNNING - For a one-time job, the job is in progress. For a
                   recurring job, a scheduled run is in progress.

                 o USER_PAUSED  -  You  paused  the job. If you paused the job
                   while it had a status of RUNNING and you  don't  resume  it
                   within  30  days of pausing it, the job or job run will ex-
                   pire and be cancelled, depending  on  the  job's  type.  To
                   check  the  expiration  date,  refer  to  the UserPausedDe-
                   tails.jobExpiresAt property.

              jobType -> (string)
                 The schedule for running the job. Possible values are:

                 o ONE_TIME - The job runs only once.

                 o SCHEDULED - The job runs on a daily, weekly, or monthly ba-
                   sis.

              lastRunErrorStatus -> (structure)
                 Specifies  whether any account- or bucket-level access errors
                 occurred when the job ran. For a recurring  job,  this  value
                 indicates the error status of the job's most recent run.

                 code -> (string)
                     Specifies whether any account- or bucket-level access er-
                     rors occurred when the job ran. For a recurring job, this
                     value indicates the error status of the job's most recent
                     run. Possible values are:

                     o ERROR - One  or  more  errors  occurred.  Amazon  Macie
                       didn't process all the data specified for the job.

                     o NONE - No errors occurred. Macie processed all the data
                       specified for the job.

              name -> (string)
                 The custom name of the job.

              userPausedDetails -> (structure)
                 If the current status of the job  is  USER_PAUSED,  specifies
                 when  the job was paused and when the job or job run will ex-
                 pire and be cancelled if it  isn't  resumed.  This  value  is
                 present only if the value for jobStatus is USER_PAUSED.

                 jobExpiresAt -> (timestamp)
                     The  date  and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format,
                     when the job or job run will expire and be  cancelled  if
                     you don't resume it first.

                 jobImminentExpirationHealthEventArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Health event that
                     Amazon Macie sent to notify you of the job or  job  run's
                     pending  expiration  and cancellation. This value is null
                     if a job has been paused for less than 23 days.

                 jobPausedAt -> (timestamp)
                     The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO  8601  format,
                     when you paused the job.

              bucketCriteria -> (structure)
                 The  property-  and tag-based conditions that determine which
                 S3 buckets are included or excluded from the job's  analysis.
                 Each time the job runs, the job uses these criteria to deter-
                 mine which buckets to analyze. A job's definition can contain
                 a  bucketCriteria  object  or  a bucketDefinitions array, not
                 both.

                 excludes -> (structure)
                     The property- and  tag-based  conditions  that  determine
                     which buckets to exclude from the job.

                     and -> (list)
                        An  array  of  conditions, one for each condition that
                        determines which buckets to include  or  exclude  from
                        the  job. If you specify more than one condition, Ama-
                        zon Macie uses AND logic to join the conditions.

                        (structure)
                            Specifies a property- or tag-based condition  that
                            defines  criteria  for  including  or excluding S3
                            buckets from a classification job.

                            simpleCriterion -> (structure)
                               A property-based condition that defines a prop-
                               erty,  operator, and one or more values for in-
                               cluding or excluding buckets from the job.

                               comparator -> (string)
                                   The operator to use in the condition. Valid
                                   values are EQ (equals) and NE (not equals).

                               key -> (string)
                                   The property to use in the condition.

                               values -> (list)
                                   An  array  that lists one or more values to
                                   use in the condition. If you specify multi-
                                   ple  values,  Amazon Macie uses OR logic to
                                   join the values. Valid values for each sup-
                                   ported property (key) are:

                                   o ACCOUNT_ID - A string that represents the
                                     unique identifier for the Amazon Web Ser-
                                     vices account that owns the bucket.

                                   o S3_BUCKET_EFFECTIVE_PERMISSION - A string
                                     that represents an enumerated value  that
                                     Macie        defines        for       the
                                     BucketPublicAccess.effectivePermission
                                     property of a bucket.

                                   o S3_BUCKET_NAME - A string that represents
                                     the name of a bucket.

                                   o S3_BUCKET_SHARED_ACCESS - A  string  that
                                     represents an enumerated value that Macie
                                     defines              for              the
                                     BucketMetadata.sharedAccess property of a
                                     bucket.

                                   Values  are  case  sensitive.  Also,  Macie
                                   doesn't  support  use  of partial values or
                                   wildcard characters in these values.

                                   (string)

                            tagCriterion -> (structure)
                               A tag-based condition that defines an  operator
                               and  tag keys, tag values, or tag key and value
                               pairs for including or excluding  buckets  from
                               the job.

                               comparator -> (string)
                                   The operator to use in the condition. Valid
                                   values are EQ (equals) and NE (not equals).

                               tagValues -> (list)
                                   The tag keys, tag values, or  tag  key  and
                                   value pairs to use in the condition.

                                      a  tag-based  condition  that determines
                                      whether an S3 bucket is included or  ex-
                                      cluded  from  a  classification job. Tag
                                      keys  and  values  are  case  sensitive.
                                      Also,  Amazon  Macie doesn't support use
                                      of partial values or wildcard characters
                                      in tag-based conditions.

                 includes -> (structure)
                     The  property-  and  tag-based  conditions that determine
                     which buckets to include in the job.

                     and -> (list)
                        An array of conditions, one for  each  condition  that
                        determines  which  buckets  to include or exclude from
                        the job. If you specify more than one condition,  Ama-
                        zon Macie uses AND logic to join the conditions.

                        (structure)
                            Specifies  a property- or tag-based condition that

                               cluding or excluding buckets from the job.

                               comparator -> (string)
                                   The operator to use in the condition. Valid
                                   values are EQ (equals) and NE (not equals).

                               key -> (string)
                                   The property to use in the condition.

                                   use in the condition. If you specify multi-
                                   ple values, Amazon Macie uses OR  logic  to
                                   join the values. Valid values for each sup-
                                   ported property (key) are:

                                     property of a bucket.

                                   o S3_BUCKET_NAME - A string that represents
                                     the name of a bucket.

                                   o S3_BUCKET_SHARED_ACCESS  -  A string that
                                     represents an enumerated value that Macie
                                     defines              for              the
                                     BucketMetadata.sharedAccess property of a
                                     bucket.

                                   Values  are  case  sensitive.  Also,  Macie
                                   doesn't support use of  partial  values  or
                                   wildcard characters in these values.
