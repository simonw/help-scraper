EXIT-STANDBY()                                                  EXIT-STANDBY()



NAME
       exit-standby -

DESCRIPTION
       Moves the specified instances out of the standby state.

       After  you  put  the instances back in service, the desired capacity is
       incremented.

       For more information, see Temporarily removing instances from your Auto
       Scaling group in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            exit-standby
          [--instance-ids <value>]
          --auto-scaling-group-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-ids (list)
          The IDs of the instances. You can specify up to 20 instances.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To move instances out of standby mode

       This example moves the specified instance out of standby mode.

          aws autoscaling exit-standby \
              --instance-ids i-061c63c5eb45f0416 \
              --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg

       Output:

          {
              "Activities": [
                  {
