DESCRIBE-INSTANCE-REFRESHES()                    DESCRIBE-INSTANCE-REFRESHES()



NAME
       describe-instance-refreshes -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  information  about  the instance refreshes for the specified Auto
       Scaling group.

       This operation is part of the instance refresh feature  in  Amazon  EC2
       Auto  Scaling,  which  helps  you update instances in your Auto Scaling
       group after you make configuration changes.

       To help you determine the status of an instance refresh, this operation
       returns  information about the instance refreshes you previously initi-
       ated, including their status, end time, the percentage of the  instance
       refresh  that is complete, and the number of instances remaining to up-
       date before the instance refresh is complete.

       The following are the possible statuses:

       o Pending - The request was created, but the operation has not started.

       o InProgress - The operation is in progress.

       o Successful - The operation completed successfully.

       o Failed - The operation failed to complete. You can troubleshoot using
         the status reason and the scaling activities.

       o Cancelling  -  An  ongoing operation is being cancelled. Cancellation
         does not roll back any replacements that have already been completed,
         but it prevents new replacements from being started.

       o Cancelled - The operation is cancelled.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-instance-refreshes
          --auto-scaling-group-name <value>
          [--instance-refresh-ids <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-records <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --instance-refresh-ids (list)
          One or more instance refresh IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --next-token (string)
          The  token  for  the next set of items to return. (You received this
          token from a previous call.)

       --max-records (integer)
          The maximum number of items to return with this  call.  The  default
          value is 50 and the maximum value is 100 .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       InstanceRefreshes -> (list)
          The instance refreshes for the specified group.

          (structure)
              Describes an instance refresh for an Auto Scaling group.

              InstanceRefreshId -> (string)
                 The instance refresh ID.

              AutoScalingGroupName -> (string)
                 The name of the Auto Scaling group.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status for the instance refresh operation:

                 o Pending  -  The  request was created, but the operation has
                   not started.

                 o InProgress - The operation is in progress.

                 o Successful - The operation completed successfully.

                 o Failed - The operation failed to complete.  You  can  trou-
                   bleshoot  using  the  status reason and the scaling activi-
                   ties.

                 o Cancelling - An ongoing operation is being cancelled.  Can-
                   cellation does not roll back any replacements that have al-
                   ready been completed, but it prevents new replacements from
                   being started.

                 o Cancelled - The operation is cancelled.

              StatusReason -> (string)
                 Provides  more  details  about  the current status of the in-
                 stance refresh.

              StartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time at which the instance refresh began.

              EndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time at which the instance refresh ended.

              PercentageComplete -> (integer)
                 The percentage of the instance refresh that is complete.  For
                 each instance replacement, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling tracks the
                 instance's health status  and  warm-up  time.  When  the  in-
                 stance's  health  status changes to healthy and the specified
                 warm-up time passes, the instance is considered  updated  and
                 is added to the percentage complete.

              InstancesToUpdate -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  instances remaining to update before the in-
                 stance refresh is complete.

              ProgressDetails -> (structure)
                 Additional progress details for an Auto  Scaling  group  that
                 has a warm pool.

                 LivePoolProgress -> (structure)
                     Indicates  the  progress  of  an  instance refresh on in-
                     stances that are in the Auto Scaling group.

                     PercentageComplete -> (integer)
                        The percentage of instances in the Auto Scaling  group
                        that  have  been  replaced. For each instance replace-
                        ment, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling  tracks  the  instance's
                        health  status  and  warm-up time. When the instance's
                        health status changes to  healthy  and  the  specified
                        warm-up  time  passes,  the instance is considered up-
                        dated and is added to the percentage complete.

                     InstancesToUpdate -> (integer)
                        The number of instances remaining to update.

                 WarmPoolProgress -> (structure)
                     Indicates the progress of  an  instance  refresh  on  in-
                     stances that are in the warm pool.

                     PercentageComplete -> (integer)
                        The percentage of instances in the warm pool that have
                        been replaced. For each instance  replacement,  Amazon
                        EC2  Auto  Scaling tracks the instance's health status
                        and warm-up time. When the  instance's  health  status
                        changes  to  healthy  and  the  specified warm-up time
                        passes, the instance  is  considered  updated  and  is
                        added to the percentage complete.

                     InstancesToUpdate -> (integer)
                        The number of instances remaining to update.

              Preferences -> (structure)
                 Describes the preferences for an instance refresh.

                 MinHealthyPercentage -> (integer)
                     The  amount  of  capacity  in the Auto Scaling group that
                     must pass your group's health checks to allow the  opera-
                     tion  to continue. The value is expressed as a percentage
                     of  the  desired  capacity  of  the  Auto  Scaling  group
                     (rounded up to the nearest integer). The default is 90 .

                     Setting  the  minimum  healthy  percentage to 100 percent
                     limits the rate of replacement to one instance at a time.
                     In  contrast,  setting  it to 0 percent has the effect of
                     replacing all instances at the same time.

                 InstanceWarmup -> (integer)
                        Not needed if the default instance warmup  is  defined
                        for the group.

                     The duration of the instance warmup, in seconds.

                     NOTE:
                        The  default  is  to use the value for the default in-
                        stance warmup defined for the group.  If  default  in-
                        stance  warmup is null, then InstanceWarmup falls back
                        to the value of the health check grace period.

                 CheckpointPercentages -> (list)
                     Threshold values for each checkpoint in ascending  order.
                     Each  number  must be unique. To replace all instances in
                     the Auto Scaling group, the last number in the array must
                     be 100 .

                     For usage examples, see Adding checkpoints to an instance
                     refresh in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

                     (integer)

                 CheckpointDelay -> (integer)
                     The amount of time, in seconds, to wait  after  a  check-
                     point  before  continuing. This property is optional, but
                     if you specify a value for it, you must  also  specify  a
                     value  for CheckpointPercentages . If you specify a value
                     for CheckpointPercentages and not for  CheckpointDelay  ,
                     the CheckpointDelay defaults to 3600 (1 hour).

                 SkipMatching -> (boolean)
                     A  boolean  value that indicates whether skip matching is
                     enabled. If true, then Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling skips  re-
                     placing  instances  that match the desired configuration.
                     If no desired configuration is specified, then  it  skips
                     replacing instances that have the same configuration that
                     is already set on the group. The default is false .

              DesiredConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Describes the specific update you want to deploy.

                 LaunchTemplate -> (structure)
                     Describes the launch template  and  the  version  of  the
                     launch  template  that  Amazon  EC2  Auto Scaling uses to
                     launch Amazon EC2 instances. For more  information  about
                     launch  templates, see Launch templates in the Amazon EC2
                     Auto Scaling User Guide .

                     LaunchTemplateId -> (string)
                        The ID of the launch template. To get the template ID,
                        use  the Amazon EC2 DescribeLaunchTemplates API opera-
                        tion. New launch templates can be  created  using  the
                        Amazon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                        Conditional:  You  must  specify  either  a LaunchTem-
                        plateId or a LaunchTemplateName .

                     LaunchTemplateName -> (string)
                        The name of the launch template. To get  the  template
                        name,  use  the Amazon EC2 DescribeLaunchTemplates API
                        operation. New launch templates can be  created  using
                        the Amazon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                        Conditional:  You  must  specify  either  a LaunchTem-
                        plateId or a LaunchTemplateName .

                     Version -> (string)
                        The version number, $Latest , or $Default . To get the
                        version     number,     use     the     Amazon     EC2
                        DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions  API   operation.   New
                        launch template versions can be created using the Ama-
                        zon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplateVersion API. If the  value
                        is  $Latest , Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling selects the lat-
                        est version of the launch template when launching  in-
                        stances.  If  the  value is $Default , Amazon EC2 Auto
                        Scaling selects the default version of the launch tem-
                        plate  when  launching instances. The default value is
                        $Default .

                 MixedInstancesPolicy -> (structure)
                     Describes a mixed instances  policy.  A  mixed  instances
                     policy  contains  the instance types that Amazon EC2 Auto
                     Scaling can launch and other information that Amazon  EC2
                     Auto  Scaling  can use to launch instances and help opti-
                     mize your costs. For more information, see  Auto  Scaling
                     groups  with multiple instance types and purchase options
                     in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

                     LaunchTemplate -> (structure)
                        Specifies the launch template to use and the  instance
                        types  (overrides)  that  are  used  to launch EC2 in-
                        stances to fulfill On-Demand and Spot capacities.  Re-
                        quired when creating a mixed instances policy.

                        LaunchTemplateSpecification -> (structure)
                            The launch template to use.

                            LaunchTemplateId -> (string)
                               The  ID of the launch template. To get the tem-
                               plate    ID,     use     the     Amazon     EC2
                               DescribeLaunchTemplates   API   operation.  New
                               launch templates can be created using the  Ama-
                               zon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                               Conditional:   You   must   specify   either  a
                               LaunchTemplateId or a LaunchTemplateName .

                            LaunchTemplateName -> (string)
                               The name of the launch  template.  To  get  the
                               template    name,    use    the    Amazon   EC2
                               DescribeLaunchTemplates  API   operation.   New
                               launch  templates can be created using the Ama-
                               zon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                               Conditional:  You   must   specify   either   a
                               LaunchTemplateId or a LaunchTemplateName .

                            Version -> (string)
                               The  version number, $Latest , or $Default . To
                               get the version  number,  use  the  Amazon  EC2
                               DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions  API  operation.
                               New launch template versions can be created us-
                               ing  the Amazon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplateVersion
                               API. If the value is $Latest , Amazon EC2  Auto
                               Scaling  selects  the  latest  version  of  the

                               the value is $Default , Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
                               selects the default version of the launch  tem-
                               plate  when  launching  instances.  The default
                               value is $Default .

                        Overrides -> (list)
                            Any properties that you specify override the  same
                            properties  in  the  launch  template. If not pro-
                            vided, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses  the  instance
                            type  or  instance  type requirements specified in
                            the launch template when it launches an instance.

                            The overrides can include either one or  more  in-
                            stance  types  or  a set of instance requirements,
                            but not both.

                               InstanceType -> (string)
                                   The instance type, such as m3.xlarge .  You
                                   must use an instance type that is supported
                                   in your requested Region  and  Availability
                                   Zones.  For  more information, see Instance

                               WeightedCapacity -> (string)
                                   The  number  of  capacity units provided by
                                   the instance type specified in InstanceType
                                   in  terms of virtual CPUs, memory, storage,
                                   throughput, or other  relative  performance
                                   characteristic.  When  a  Spot or On-Demand
                                   Instance is launched,  the  capacity  units
                                   count  toward  the desired capacity. Amazon
                                   EC2 Auto Scaling launches  instances  until
                                   the  desired capacity is totally fulfilled,
                                   even if this results in an overage. For ex-
                                   ample,  if there are two units remaining to
                                   fulfill capacity, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scal-
                                   ing  can  only  launch  an  instance with a
                                   WeightedCapacity of  five  units,  the  in-
                                   stance  is launched, and the desired capac-

                                      Instances. This is the maximum youll pay
                                      for a Spot Instance, expressed as a per-
                                      centage  higher  than the cheapest M, C,
                                      or R instance type with  your  specified
                                      attributes. When Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
                                      selects instance  types  with  your  at-
                                      tributes, we will exclude instance types

                                      old.  The  parameter accepts an integer,
                                      which Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling interprets
                                      as  a percentage. To turn off price pro-
                                      tection, specify a high value,  such  as
                                      999999 .

                                      If  you  set DesiredCapacityType to vcpu
                                      or memory-mib  ,  the  price  protection
                                      threshold  is  applied  based on the per
                                      vCPU or per memory price instead of  the
                                      per instance price.

                                      your  specified  attributes. When Amazon
                                      EC2 Auto Scaling selects instance  types
                                      with  your  attributes,  we will exclude
                                      instance types  whose  price  is  higher
                                      than  your  threshold. The parameter ac-
                                      cepts an integer, which Amazon EC2  Auto
                                      Scaling  interprets  as a percentage. To
                                      turn off  price  protection,  specify  a
                                      high value, such as 999999 .

                                      If  you  set DesiredCapacityType to vcpu
                                      or memory-mib  ,  the  price  protection
                                      threshold  is  applied  based on the per
                                      vCPU or per memory price instead of  the
                                      per instance price.

                                          The memory minimum in MiB.

                                      Max -> (integer)
                                          The memory maximum in MiB.

                     InstancesDistribution -> (structure)
                        Specifies the instances distribution.

                        OnDemandAllocationStrategy -> (string)
                            The  order of the launch template overrides to use
                            in fulfilling On-Demand capacity.

                            If you specify  lowest-price  ,  Amazon  EC2  Auto
                            Scaling uses price to determine the order, launch-
                            ing the lowest price first.

                            If you specify prioritized , Amazon EC2 Auto Scal-
                            ing  uses  the  priority that you assigned to each
                            launch template override,  launching  the  highest
                            priority  first.  If  all  your On-Demand capacity
                            cannot be fulfilled using  your  highest  priority
                            instance,  then  Amazon  EC2 Auto Scaling launches
                            the remaining capacity using the  second  priority
                            instance type, and so on.

                            Default: lowest-price for Auto Scaling groups that
                            specify  InstanceRequirements in the overrides and
                            prioritized for Auto Scaling groups that don't.

                        OnDemandBaseCapacity -> (integer)
                            The minimum amount of the Auto Scaling group's ca-
                            pacity that must be  fulfilled  by  On-Demand  In-
                            stances.  This  base  portion is launched first as
                            your group scales.

                            If you specify weights for the instance  types  in
                            the  overrides,  the  base capacity is measured in
                            the same  unit  of  measurement  as  the  instance
                            types. If you specify  InstanceRequirements in the
                            overrides, the base capacity is  measured  in  the
                            same  unit  of measurement as your group's desired
                            capacity.

                            Default: 0

                        OnDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity -> (integer)
                            Controls the percentages  of  On-Demand  Instances
                            and  Spot  Instances  for your additional capacity
                            beyond OnDemandBaseCapacity . Expressed as a  num-
                            ber  (for  example, 20 specifies 20% On-Demand In-
                            stances, 80% Spot Instances). If set to 100,  only
                            On-Demand Instances are used.

                            Default: 100

                        SpotAllocationStrategy -> (string)
                            Indicates  how  to  allocate instances across Spot
                            Instance pools.

                            If the allocation strategy is lowest-price  ,  the
                            Auto  Scaling  group  launches instances using the
                            Spot pools with the lowest price, and evenly allo-
                            cates  your  instances  across  the number of Spot
                            pools that you specify.

                            If the allocation strategy  is  capacity-optimized
                            (recommended), the Auto Scaling group launches in-
                            stances using Spot pools that are optimally chosen
                            based  on  the  available  Spot capacity. Alterna-
                            tively, you can use capacity-optimized-prioritized
                            and set the order of instance types in the list of
                            launch template overrides from highest  to  lowest
                            priority  (from first to last in the list). Amazon
                            EC2 Auto Scaling honors the instance type  priori-
                            ties  on a best-effort basis but optimizes for ca-
                            pacity first.

                            Default: lowest-price

                        SpotInstancePools -> (integer)
                            The number of Spot Instance pools across which  to
                            allocate  your  Spot Instances. The Spot pools are
                            determined from the different  instance  types  in
                            the overrides. Valid only when the Spot allocation
                            strategy is lowest-price . Value must  be  in  the
                            range of 120.

                            Default: 2

                        SpotMaxPrice -> (string)
                            The maximum price per unit hour that you are will-
                            ing to pay for a Spot Instance. If  you  keep  the
                            value  at  its  default  (unspecified), Amazon EC2
                            Auto Scaling uses the On-Demand price as the maxi-
                            mum  Spot price. To remove a value that you previ-
                            ously set, include the  property  but  specify  an
                            empty string ("") for the value.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  string  that indicates that the response contains more items than
          can be returned in a single response. To receive  additional  items,
          specify this string for the NextToken value when requesting the next
          set of items. This value is null when there are no more items to re-
          turn.
