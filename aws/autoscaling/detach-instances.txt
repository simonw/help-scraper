DETACH-INSTANCES()                                          DETACH-INSTANCES()



NAME
       detach-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes one or more instances from the specified Auto Scaling group.

       After  the  instances  are detached, you can manage them independent of
       the Auto Scaling group.

       If you do not specify the option to  decrement  the  desired  capacity,
       Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches instances to replace the ones that are
       detached.

       If there is a Classic Load Balancer attached to the Auto Scaling group,
       the  instances  are  deregistered  from the load balancer. If there are
       target groups attached to the Auto Scaling  group,  the  instances  are
       deregistered from the target groups.

       For  more  information, see Detach EC2 instances from your Auto Scaling
       group in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            detach-instances
          [--instance-ids <value>]
          --auto-scaling-group-name <value>
          --should-decrement-desired-capacity | --no-should-decrement-desired-capacity
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-ids (list)
          The IDs of the instances. You can specify up to 20 instances.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --should-decrement-desired-capacity | --no-should-decrement-desired-ca-
       pacity (boolean)
          Indicates  whether the Auto Scaling group decrements the desired ca-
          pacity value by the number of instances detached.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To detach an instance from an Auto Scaling group

       This  example  detaches  the specified instance from the specified Auto
       Scaling group.

          aws autoscaling detach-instances \
              --instance-ids i-030017cfa84b20135 \
              --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
              --should-decrement-desired-capacity

       Output:

          {
              "Activities": [
                  {
                      "ActivityId": "5091cb52-547a-47ce-a236-c9ccbc2cb2c9",
                      "AutoScalingGroupName": "my-asg",
                      "Description": "Detaching EC2 instance: i-030017cfa84b20135",

                      "StartTime": "2020-04-12T15:02:16.179Z",
                      "StatusCode": "InProgress",
