UPDATE-AUTO-SCALING-GROUP()                        UPDATE-AUTO-SCALING-GROUP()



NAME
       update-auto-scaling-group -

DESCRIPTION
          We  strongly  recommend that all Auto Scaling groups use launch tem-
          plates to ensure full functionality for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling  and
          Amazon EC2.

       Updates the configuration for the specified Auto Scaling group.

       To  update an Auto Scaling group, specify the name of the group and the
       parameter that you want to change. Any parameters that you don't  spec-
       ify  are  not changed by this update request. The new settings take ef-
       fect on any scaling activities after this call returns.

       If you associate a new launch configuration or template  with  an  Auto
       Scaling  group,  all  new instances will get the updated configuration.
       Existing instances continue to run with  the  configuration  that  they
       were  originally  launched  with.  When you update a group to specify a
       mixed instances policy instead of a launch configuration  or  template,
       existing  instances may be replaced to match the new purchasing options
       that you specified in the policy. For example, if the  group  currently
       has 100% On-Demand capacity and the policy specifies 50% Spot capacity,
       this means that half of your instances will be gradually terminated and
       relaunched as Spot Instances. When replacing instances, Amazon EC2 Auto
       Scaling launches new instances before terminating the old ones, so that
       updating your group does not compromise the performance or availability
       of your application.

       Note the following about changing DesiredCapacity , MaxSize ,  or  Min-
       Size :

       o If  a  scale-in  activity occurs as a result of a new DesiredCapacity
         value that is lower than the current size  of  the  group,  the  Auto
         Scaling  group  uses  its  termination  policy to determine which in-
         stances to terminate.

       o If you specify a new value for MinSize without specifying a value for
         DesiredCapacity , and the new MinSize is larger than the current size
         of the group, this sets the group's DesiredCapacity to the  new  Min-
         Size value.

       o If you specify a new value for MaxSize without specifying a value for
         DesiredCapacity , and the new MaxSize is  smaller  than  the  current
         size  of  the group, this sets the group's DesiredCapacity to the new
         MaxSize value.

       To see which parameters have been set, call  the   DescribeAutoScaling-
       Groups  API.  To  view  the scaling policies for an Auto Scaling group,
       call the  DescribePolicies API. If the group has scaling policies,  you
       can update them by calling the  PutScalingPolicy API.

OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --launch-configuration-name (string)
          The  name of the launch configuration. If you specify LaunchConfigu-
          rationName in your update request, you can't specify  LaunchTemplate
          or MixedInstancesPolicy .

       --launch-template (structure)
          The  launch  template  and version to use to specify the updates. If
          you specify LaunchTemplate in your update request, you can't specify
          LaunchConfigurationName or MixedInstancesPolicy .

          LaunchTemplateId -> (string)
              The  ID  of the launch template. To get the template ID, use the
              Amazon EC2 DescribeLaunchTemplates  API  operation.  New  launch
              templates    can    be    created    using    the   Amazon   EC2
              CreateLaunchTemplate API.

              Conditional: You must specify either  a  LaunchTemplateId  or  a
              LaunchTemplateName .

          LaunchTemplateName -> (string)
              The  name  of the launch template. To get the template name, use
              the Amazon EC2 DescribeLaunchTemplates API operation. New launch
              templates    can    be    created    using    the   Amazon   EC2
              CreateLaunchTemplate API.

              Conditional: You must specify either  a  LaunchTemplateId  or  a
              LaunchTemplateName .

          Version -> (string)
              The  version  number, $Latest , or $Default . To get the version
              number, use the Amazon  EC2  DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions  API
              operation. New launch template versions can be created using the
              Amazon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplateVersion  API.  If  the  value  is
              $Latest  , Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling selects the latest version of
              the launch template when launching instances. If  the  value  is
              $Default  ,  Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling selects the default version
              of the launch template when  launching  instances.  The  default
              value is $Default .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          LaunchTemplateId=string,LaunchTemplateName=string,Version=string

          LaunchTemplate -> (structure)
              Specifies  the  launch  template  to  use and the instance types
              (overrides) that are used to launch  EC2  instances  to  fulfill
              On-Demand  and  Spot  capacities. Required when creating a mixed
              instances policy.

              LaunchTemplateSpecification -> (structure)
                 The launch template to use.

                 LaunchTemplateId -> (string)
                     The ID of the launch template. To get  the  template  ID,
                     use the Amazon EC2 DescribeLaunchTemplates API operation.
                     New launch templates can be created using the Amazon  EC2
                     CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                     Conditional:  You  must specify either a LaunchTemplateId
                     or a LaunchTemplateName .

                 LaunchTemplateName -> (string)
                     The name of the launch  template.  To  get  the  template
                     name,  use the Amazon EC2 DescribeLaunchTemplates API op-
                     eration. New launch templates can be  created  using  the
                     Amazon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                     Conditional:  You  must specify either a LaunchTemplateId
                     or a LaunchTemplateName .

                 Version -> (string)
                     The version number, $Latest , or $Default .  To  get  the
                     version      number,      use      the     Amazon     EC2
                     DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions API operation. New  launch
                     template  versions  can  be  created using the Amazon EC2
                     CreateLaunchTemplateVersion API. If the value is  $Latest
                     ,  Amazon  EC2 Auto Scaling selects the latest version of
                     the launch template  when  launching  instances.  If  the
                     value  is  $Default , Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling selects the
                     default version of the launch template when launching in-
                     stances. The default value is $Default .

              Overrides -> (list)
                 Any  properties that you specify override the same properties
                 in the launch template. If  not  provided,  Amazon  EC2  Auto
                 Scaling  uses the instance type or instance type requirements
                 specified in the launch template  when  it  launches  an  in-
                 stance.

                 The  overrides  can include either one or more instance types
                 or a set of instance requirements, but not both.

                 (structure)
                     Describes an override for a launch template. For more in-
                     formation,  see  Configuring  overrides in the Amazon EC2
                     Auto Scaling User Guide .

                     InstanceType -> (string)
                        The instance type, such as m3.xlarge . You must use an
                        instance  type that is supported in your requested Re-
                        gion and Availability Zones. For more information, see
                        Instance  types  in  the  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
                        User Guide .

                     WeightedCapacity -> (string)
                        The number of capacity units provided by the  instance
                        type  specified  in  InstanceType  in terms of virtual
                        CPUs, memory, storage, throughput, or  other  relative
                        performance  characteristic.  When a Spot or On-Demand
                        Instance is launched, the capacity units count  toward
                        the desired capacity. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches
                        instances until the desired capacity is  totally  ful-
                        filled,  even if this results in an overage. For exam-
                        ple, if there are two units remaining to  fulfill  ca-
                        pacity, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can only launch an
                        instance with a WeightedCapacity of  five  units,  the
                        instance  is launched, and the desired capacity is ex-
                        ceeded by  three  units.  For  more  information,  see
                        Configuring  instance  weighting  for  Amazon EC2 Auto
                        Scaling in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling  User  Guide  .
                        Value must be in the range of 1999.

                     LaunchTemplateSpecification -> (structure)
                        Provides  a launch template for the specified instance
                        type or instance requirements. For example,  some  in-
                        stance  types  might  require a launch template with a
                        different AMI. If not provided, Amazon EC2 Auto  Scal-
                        ing  uses  the launch template that's defined for your
                        mixed instances  policy.  For  more  information,  see
                        Specifying a different launch template for an instance
                        type in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

                        LaunchTemplateId -> (string)
                            The ID of the launch template. To get the template
                            ID, use the Amazon EC2 DescribeLaunchTemplates API
                            operation. New launch templates can be created us-
                            ing the Amazon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                            Conditional:  You must specify either a LaunchTem-
                            plateId or a LaunchTemplateName .

                        LaunchTemplateName -> (string)
                            The name of the launch template. To get  the  tem-
                            plate     name,     use     the     Amazon     EC2
                            DescribeLaunchTemplates API operation. New  launch
                            templates  can  be  created  using  the Amazon EC2
                            CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                            Conditional: You must specify either a  LaunchTem-
                            plateId or a LaunchTemplateName .

                        Version -> (string)
                            The version number, $Latest , or $Default . To get
                            the   version   number,   use   the   Amazon   EC2
                            DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions  API operation. New
                            launch template versions can be created using  the
                            Amazon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplateVersion API. If the
                            value is $Latest , Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling selects
                            the  latest  version  of  the launch template when
                            launching instances. If the value  is  $Default  ,
                            Amazon  EC2  Auto Scaling selects the default ver-
                            sion of the launch  template  when  launching  in-
                            stances. The default value is $Default .

                     InstanceRequirements -> (structure)
                        The  instance  requirements. When you specify instance
                        requirements, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling  finds  instance
                        types  that  satisfy  your requirements, and then uses
                        your  On-Demand  and  Spot  allocation  strategies  to
                        launch  instances  from  these  instance types, in the
                        same way as when you specify a list  of  specific  in-
                        stance types.

                        VCpuCount -> (structure)
                            The minimum and maximum number of vCPUs for an in-
                            stance type.

                            Min -> (integer)
                               The minimum number of vCPUs.

                            Max -> (integer)
                               The maximum number of vCPUs.

                        MemoryMiB -> (structure)
                            The minimum and maximum instance memory  size  for
                            an instance type, in MiB.

                            Min -> (integer)
                               The memory minimum in MiB.

                            Max -> (integer)
                               The memory maximum in MiB.

                        CpuManufacturers -> (list)
                            Lists which specific CPU manufacturers to include.

                            o For  instance types with Intel CPUs, specify in-
                              tel .

                            o For instance types with AMD CPUs, specify amd .

                            o For instance  types  with  Amazon  Web  Services
                              CPUs, specify amazon-web-services .

                            NOTE:
                               Don't  confuse  the  CPU  hardware manufacturer
                               with the CPU hardware  architecture.  Instances
                               will  be  launched with a compatible CPU archi-
                               tecture based on the Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
                               that you specify in your launch template.

                            Default: Any manufacturer

                            (string)

                        MemoryGiBPerVCpu -> (structure)

                            for an instance type, in GiB.

                            Default: No minimum or maximum

                            Min -> (double)
                               The memory minimum in GiB.

                            Max -> (double)
                               The memory maximum in GiB.

                        ExcludedInstanceTypes -> (list)
                            Lists which instance types to exclude. You can use
                            strings  with  one or more wild cards, represented
                            by an asterisk (* ). The following  are  examples:
                            c5* , m5a.* , r* , *3* .

                            For  example, if you specify c5* , you are exclud-
                            ing the entire C5 instance family, which  includes
                            all  C5a  and  C5n  instance types. If you specify
                            m5a.* , you are excluding  all  the  M5a  instance
                            types, but not the M5n instance types.

                            Default: No excluded instance types

                            (string)

                        InstanceGenerations -> (list)
                            Indicates  whether  current or previous generation
                            instance types are included.

                            o For current generation instance  types,  specify
                              current  .  The  current generation includes EC2
                              instance types currently  recommended  for  use.
                              This  typically includes the latest two to three
                              generations in each instance  family.  For  more

                            The price protection threshold for Spot Instances.
                            This is the maximum youll pay for a Spot Instance,
                            expressed as a percentage higher than the cheapest
                            M, C, or R instance type with your  specified  at-
                            tributes. When Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling selects in-
                            stance types with your attributes, we will exclude
                            instance  types  whose  price  is higher than your
                            threshold. The parameter accepts an integer, which
                            Amazon  EC2  Auto Scaling interprets as a percent-
                            age. To turn off price protection, specify a  high
                            value, such as 999999 .

                            If  you  set  DesiredCapacityType  to vcpu or mem-
                            ory-mib , the price protection  threshold  is  ap-
                            plied  based  on  the per vCPU or per memory price
                            instead of the per instance price.

                            stances.  This  is  the  maximum  youll pay for an
                            On-Demand  Instance,  expressed  as  a  percentage
                            higher  than the cheapest M, C, or R instance type
                            with your specified attributes.  When  Amazon  EC2
                            Auto  Scaling selects instance types with your at-
                            tributes, we will  exclude  instance  types  whose
                            price is higher than your threshold. The parameter
                            accepts an integer, which Amazon EC2 Auto  Scaling
                            interprets as a percentage. To turn off price pro-
                            tection, specify a high value, such as 999999 .

                            If you set DesiredCapacityType  to  vcpu  or  mem-
                            ory-mib  ,  the  price protection threshold is ap-
                            plied based on the per vCPU or  per  memory  price
                            instead of the per instance price.

              OnDemandAllocationStrategy -> (string)
                 The order of the launch template overrides to use in fulfill-
                 ing On-Demand capacity.

                 If  you  specify  lowest-price , Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses
                 price to determine the  order,  launching  the  lowest  price
                 first.

                 If you specify prioritized , Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses the
                 priority that you assigned to each launch template  override,
                 launching  the  highest priority first. If all your On-Demand
                 capacity cannot be fulfilled using your highest priority  in-
                 stance,  then  Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches the remaining
                 capacity using the second priority instance type, and so on.

                 Default: lowest-price for Auto Scaling  groups  that  specify
                 InstanceRequirements  in  the  overrides  and prioritized for
                 Auto Scaling groups that don't.

              OnDemandBaseCapacity -> (integer)
                 The minimum amount of the Auto Scaling group's capacity  that
                 must  be  fulfilled by On-Demand Instances. This base portion
                 is launched first as your group scales.

                 If you specify weights for the instance types  in  the  over-
                 rides, the base capacity is measured in the same unit of mea-
                 surement  as  the  instance  types.  If  you   specify    In-
                 stanceRequirements  in  the  overrides,  the base capacity is
                 measured in the same unit of measurement as your group's  de-
                 sired capacity.

                 Default: 0

              OnDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity -> (integer)
                 Controls  the percentages of On-Demand Instances and Spot In-
                 stances for your additional capacity  beyond  OnDemandBaseCa-
                 pacity . Expressed as a number (for example, 20 specifies 20%
                 On-Demand Instances, 80% Spot Instances). If set to 100, only
                 On-Demand Instances are used.

                 Default: 100

              SpotAllocationStrategy -> (string)
                 Indicates  how  to  allocate  instances  across Spot Instance
                 pools.

                 If the allocation strategy is lowest-price , the Auto Scaling
                 group launches instances using the Spot pools with the lowest
                 price, and evenly allocates your instances across the  number
                 of Spot pools that you specify.

                 If  the  allocation  strategy  is  capacity-optimized (recom-
                 mended), the Auto Scaling group launches instances using Spot
                 pools  that  are optimally chosen based on the available Spot
                 capacity. Alternatively, you can use  capacity-optimized-pri-
                 oritized  and  set the order of instance types in the list of
                 launch template overrides from  highest  to  lowest  priority
                 (from  first  to  last  in the list). Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
                 honors the instance type priorities on  a  best-effort  basis
                 but optimizes for capacity first.

                 Default: lowest-price

              SpotInstancePools -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  Spot Instance pools across which to allocate
                 your Spot Instances. The Spot pools are determined  from  the
                 different  instance  types  in the overrides. Valid only when
                 the Spot allocation strategy is lowest-price . Value must  be
                 in the range of 120.

                 Default: 2

              SpotMaxPrice -> (string)
                 The  maximum  price per unit hour that you are willing to pay
                 for a Spot Instance. If you keep the  value  at  its  default
                 (unspecified),  Amazon  EC2  Auto  Scaling uses the On-Demand
                 price as the maximum Spot price. To remove a value  that  you
                 previously  set,  include  the  property but specify an empty
                 string ("") for the value.

       --min-size (integer)
          The minimum size of the Auto Scaling group.

       --max-size (integer)
          The maximum size of the Auto Scaling group.

          NOTE:
              With a mixed instances policy that uses instance weighting, Ama-
              zon  EC2  Auto Scaling may need to go above MaxSize to meet your
              capacity requirements. In this event, Amazon  EC2  Auto  Scaling
              will  never  go above MaxSize by more than your largest instance
              weight (weights that define how many units  each  instance  con-
              tributes to the desired capacity of the group).

       --desired-capacity (integer)
          The  desired  capacity  is  the initial capacity of the Auto Scaling
          group after this operation completes and the capacity it attempts to
          maintain.  This  number must be greater than or equal to the minimum
          size of the group and less than or equal to the maximum size of  the
          group.

       --default-cooldown (integer)
              Only needed if you use simple scaling policies.

          The  amount of time, in seconds, between one scaling activity ending
          and another one starting due to simple scaling  policies.  For  more
          information,  see  Scaling  cooldowns for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling in
          the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

       --availability-zones (list)
          One or more Availability Zones for the group.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --health-check-type (string)
          The service to use for the health checks. The valid values  are  EC2
          and  ELB  . If you configure an Auto Scaling group to use ELB health
          checks, it considers the instance unhealthy if it fails  either  the
          EC2 status checks or the load balancer health checks.

       --health-check-grace-period (integer)
          The  amount  of time, in seconds, that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits
          before checking the health status of an EC2 instance that  has  come
          into  service  and marking it unhealthy due to a failed Elastic Load
          Balancing or custom health check. This is useful if  your  instances
          do not immediately pass these health checks after they enter the In-
          Service state. For more information, see Health check  grace  period
          in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

       --placement-group (string)
          The  name  of  an existing placement group into which to launch your
          instances. For more information, see Placement groups in the  Amazon
          EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances .

          NOTE:
              A  cluster  placement  group  is a logical grouping of instances
              within a single Availability Zone. You cannot  specify  multiple
              Availability Zones and a cluster placement group.

       --vpc-zone-identifier (string)
          A  comma-separated  list  of  subnet IDs for a virtual private cloud
          (VPC). If you specify VPCZoneIdentifier with AvailabilityZones , the
          subnets  that  you  specify  for this parameter must reside in those
          Availability Zones.

       --termination-policies (list)
          A policy or a list of policies that are used to select the instances
          to  terminate.  The policies are executed in the order that you list
          them. For more information, see Controlling which Auto  Scaling  in-
          stances  terminate  during  scale  in in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
          User Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --new-instances-protected-from-scale-in    |    --no-new-instances-pro-
       tected-from-scale-in (boolean)
          Indicates whether newly launched instances are protected from termi-
          nation by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling when scaling in. For more informa-
          tion  about  preventing  instances from terminating on scale in, see
          Using instance scale-in protection in the Amazon  EC2  Auto  Scaling
          User Guide .

       --service-linked-role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the service-linked role that the
          Auto Scaling group uses to call other Amazon Web  Services  on  your
          behalf. For more information, see Service-linked roles in the Amazon
          EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

       --max-instance-lifetime (integer)
          The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that an instance can  be  in
          service. The default is null. If specified, the value must be either
          0 or a number equal to or greater than 86,400 seconds  (1  day).  To
          clear a previously set value, specify a new value of 0. For more in-
          formation, see Replacing Auto Scaling instances based on maximum in-
          stance lifetime in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

       --capacity-rebalance | --no-capacity-rebalance (boolean)
          Enables  or disables Capacity Rebalancing. For more information, see
          Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling Capacity Rebalancing in the Amazon EC2  Auto
          Scaling User Guide .

       --context (string)
          Reserved.

       --desired-capacity-type (string)
          The  unit  of measurement for the value specified for desired capac-
          ity. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling supports DesiredCapacityType for attri-
          bute-based  instance  type selection only. For more information, see
          Creating an Auto Scaling group using attribute-based  instance  type
          selection in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

          By  default,  Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling specifies units , which trans-
          lates into number of instances.

          Valid values: units | vcpu | memory-mib

       --default-instance-warmup (integer)
          The amount of time, in seconds, until a newly launched instance  can
          contribute  to the Amazon CloudWatch metrics. This delay lets an in-
          stance finish initializing before Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling aggregates
          instance  metrics,  resulting  in more reliable usage data. Set this
          value equal to the amount of time that it takes  for  resource  con-
          sumption  to  become  stable after an instance reaches the InService
          state. For more information, see Set the default instance warmup for
          an Auto Scaling group in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

          WARNING:
              To manage your warm-up settings at the group level, we recommend
              that you set the default instance warmup, even if its  value  is
              set  to 0 seconds . This also optimizes the performance of scal-
              ing policies that scale continuously, such  as  target  tracking
              and step scaling policies.

              If  you  need to remove a value that you previously set, include
              the property but specify -1 for the value. However, we  strongly
              recommend  keeping the default instance warmup enabled by speci-
              fying a minimum value of 0 .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
