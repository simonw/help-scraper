PUT-SCHEDULED-UPDATE-GROUP-ACTION()        PUT-SCHEDULED-UPDATE-GROUP-ACTION()



NAME
       put-scheduled-update-group-action -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  or  updates  a  scheduled  scaling  action for an Auto Scaling
       group.

       For more information, see Scheduled scaling  in  the  Amazon  EC2  Auto
       Scaling User Guide .

       You  can view the scheduled actions for an Auto Scaling group using the
       DescribeScheduledActions API call. If you are no longer using a  sched-
       uled  action,  you  can delete it by calling the  DeleteScheduledAction
       API.

       If you try to schedule your action in the past, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
       returns an error message.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-scheduled-update-group-action
          --auto-scaling-group-name <value>
          --scheduled-action-name <value>
          [--time <value>]
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--recurrence <value>]
          [--min-size <value>]
          [--max-size <value>]
          [--desired-capacity <value>]
          [--time-zone <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --scheduled-action-name (string)
          The name of this scaling action.

       --time (timestamp)
          This property is no longer used.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The  date and time for this action to start, in YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ
          format   in   UTC/GMT   only   and   in   quotes    (for    example,
          "2021-06-01T00:00:00Z" ).

          If  you  specify  Recurrence and StartTime , Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
          performs the action at this time, and then performs the action based
          on the specified recurrence.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The date and time for the recurring schedule to end, in UTC. For ex-
          ample, "2021-06-01T00:00:00Z" .

       --recurrence (string)
          The recurring schedule for this action. This format consists of five
          fields  separated  by  white  spaces: [Minute] [Hour] [Day_of_Month]
          [Month_of_Year] [Day_of_Week]. The value must be in quotes (for  ex-
          ample,  "30 0 1 1,6,12 *" ). For more information about this format,
          see Crontab .

          When StartTime and EndTime are specified with Recurrence , they form
          the boundaries of when the recurring action starts and stops.

          Cron expressions use Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) by default.

       --min-size (integer)
          The minimum size of the Auto Scaling group.

       --max-size (integer)
          The maximum size of the Auto Scaling group.

       --desired-capacity (integer)
          The  desired  capacity  is  the initial capacity of the Auto Scaling
          group after the scheduled action runs and the capacity  it  attempts
          to maintain. It can scale beyond this capacity if you add more scal-
          ing conditions.

          NOTE:
              You must specify at least one of the following properties:  Max-
              Size , MinSize , or DesiredCapacity .

       --time-zone (string)
          Specifies the time zone for a cron expression. If a time zone is not
          provided, UTC is used by default.

          Valid values are the canonical names of the IANA time zones, derived
          from  the  IANA  Time  Zone  Database  (such  as  Etc/GMT+9  or  Pa-
          cific/Tahiti      ).      For      more       information,       see
          https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To add a scheduled action to an Auto Scaling group

       This  example adds the specified scheduled action to the specified Auto
       Scaling group.

          aws autoscaling put-scheduled-update-group-action \
              --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
              --scheduled-action-name my-scheduled-action \
              --start-time "2021-05-12T08:00:00Z" \
              --min-size 2 \
              --max-size 6 \
              --desired-capacity 4

       This command produces no output. If a scheduled action  with  the  same
       name  already  exists,  it will be overwritten by the new scheduled ac-
       tion.

       For more examples, see Scheduled scaling in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
       User Guide.

       Example 2: To specify a recurring schedule

       This  example creates a scheduled action to scale on a recurring sched-
       ule that is scheduled to execute at 00:30 hours on the first  of  Janu-
       ary, June, and December every year.

          aws autoscaling put-scheduled-update-group-action \
              --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
              --scheduled-action-name my-recurring-action \
              --recurrence "30 0 1 1,6,12 *" \
              --min-size 2 \
              --max-size 6 \
              --desired-capacity 4

       This  command  produces  no output. If a scheduled action with the same
       name already exists, it will be overwritten by the  new  scheduled  ac-
       tion.

       For more examples, see Scheduled scaling in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
       User Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
