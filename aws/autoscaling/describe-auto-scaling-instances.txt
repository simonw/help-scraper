NAME
       describe-auto-scaling-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  information  about  the Auto Scaling instances in the account and
       Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-auto-scaling-instances is a paginated operation. Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: AutoScalingInstances

SYNOPSIS
            describe-auto-scaling-instances
          [--instance-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-ids (list)
          The IDs of the instances. If you omit this parameter, all Auto Scal-
          ing instances are described. If you specify an ID that does not  ex-
          ist, it is ignored with no error.

          Array Members: Maximum number of 50 items.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To describe one or more instances

       This example describes the specified instance.

          aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-instances \
              --instance-ids i-06905f55584de02da

       Output:

          {
              "AutoScalingInstances": [
                  {
                      "InstanceId": "i-06905f55584de02da",
                      "InstanceType": "t2.micro",
                      "AutoScalingGroupName": "my-asg",
                      "AvailabilityZone": "us-west-2b",
                      "LifecycleState": "InService",
                      "HealthStatus": "HEALTHY",
                      "ProtectedFromScaleIn": false,
                      "LaunchTemplate": {
                          "LaunchTemplateId": "lt-1234567890abcde12",
                          "LaunchTemplateName": "my-launch-template",
                          "Version": "1"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

       Example 2: To describe one or more instances

       This example uses the --max-items option to specify how many  instances
       to return with this call.

          aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-instances --max-items 1

       If  the output includes a NextToken field, there are more instances. To
       get the additional instances, use the value  of  this  field  with  the
       --starting-token option in a subsequent call as follows.

          aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-instances --starting-token Z3M3LMPEXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "AutoScalingInstances": [
                  {
                      "InstanceId": "i-06905f55584de02da",
                      "InstanceType": "t2.micro",
                      "AutoScalingGroupName": "my-asg",
                      "AvailabilityZone": "us-west-2b",
                      "LifecycleState": "InService",
                      "HealthStatus": "HEALTHY",
                      "ProtectedFromScaleIn": false,
                      "LaunchTemplate": {
                          "LaunchTemplateId": "lt-1234567890abcde12",
                          "LaunchTemplateName": "my-launch-template",
                          "Version": "1"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

              HealthStatus -> (string)
                 The last reported health status of this  instance.  "Healthy"
                 means  that the instance is healthy and should remain in ser-
                 vice. "Unhealthy" means that the instance  is  unhealthy  and
                 Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling should terminate and replace it.

              LaunchConfigurationName -> (string)
                 The  launch  configuration  used to launch the instance. This
                 value is not available if you attached the  instance  to  the
                 Auto Scaling group.

              LaunchTemplate -> (structure)
                 The launch template for the instance.

                 LaunchTemplateId -> (string)
                     The  ID  of  the launch template. To get the template ID,
                     use the Amazon EC2 DescribeLaunchTemplates API operation.
                     New  launch templates can be created using the Amazon EC2
                     CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                     Conditional: You must specify either  a  LaunchTemplateId
                     or a LaunchTemplateName .

                 LaunchTemplateName -> (string)
                     The  name  of  the  launch  template. To get the template
                     name, use the Amazon EC2 DescribeLaunchTemplates API  op-
                     eration.  New  launch  templates can be created using the
                     Amazon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                     Conditional: You must specify either  a  LaunchTemplateId
                     or a LaunchTemplateName .

                 Version -> (string)
                     The  version  number,  $Latest , or $Default . To get the
                     version     number,     use      the      Amazon      EC2
                     DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions  API operation. New launch
                     template versions can be created  using  the  Amazon  EC2
                     CreateLaunchTemplateVersion  API. If the value is $Latest
                     , Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling selects the latest  version  of
                     the  launch  template  when  launching  instances. If the
                     value is $Default , Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling  selects  the
                     default version of the launch template when launching in-
                     stances. The default value is $Default .

              ProtectedFromScaleIn -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the instance is protected from  termination
                 by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling when scaling in.

              WeightedCapacity -> (string)
                 The  number  of  capacity  units  contributed by the instance
                 based on its instance type.

                 Valid Range: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 999.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A string that indicates that the response contains more  items  than
          can  be  returned in a single response. To receive additional items,
          specify this string for the NextToken value when requesting the next
          set of items. This value is null when there are no more items to re-
          turn.
