DESCRIBE-TAGS()                                                DESCRIBE-TAGS()



NAME
       describe-tags -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified tags.

       You  can  use  filters to limit the results. For example, you can query
       for the tags for a specific Auto Scaling group. You can specify  multi-
       ple values for a filter. A tag must match at least one of the specified
       values for it to be included in the results.

       You can also specify multiple filters. The result includes  information
       for  a particular tag only if it matches all the filters. If there's no
       match, no special message is returned.

       For more information, see Tag Auto Scaling groups and instances in  the
       Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

       describe-tags  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Tags

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          One or more filters to scope the tags to return. The maximum  number
          of  filters  per  filter  type (for example, auto-scaling-group ) is
          1000.

          (structure)
              Describes a filter that is used to return a more  specific  list
              of results from a describe operation.

              If  you  specify multiple filters, the filters are automatically
              logically joined with an AND , and the request returns only  the
              results that match all of the specified filters.

              For  more information, see Tag Auto Scaling groups and instances
              in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 The valid values for  Name  depend  on  which  API  operation
                 you're  using  with  the filter (DescribeAutoScalingGroups or
                 DescribeTags ).
                     DescribeAutoScalingGroups

                 Valid values for Name include the following:

                 o tag-key - Accepts tag keys. The results only include infor-
                   mation  about the Auto Scaling groups associated with these
                   tag keys.

                 o tag-value - Accepts tag values. The  results  only  include
                   information  about  the Auto Scaling groups associated with
                   these tag values.

                 o tag:<key> - Accepts the key/value combination of  the  tag.
                   Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the
                   filter value. The results only  include  information  about
                   the  Auto  Scaling  groups  associated  with  the specified
                   key/value combination.
                     DescribeTags

                 Valid values for Name include the following:

                 o auto-scaling-group - Accepts  the  names  of  Auto  Scaling
                   groups. The results only include information about the tags
                   associated with these Auto Scaling groups.

                 o key - Accepts tag keys. The results only  include  informa-
                   tion about the tags associated with these tag keys.

                 o value - Accepts tag values. The results only include infor-
                   mation about the tags associated with these tag values.

                 o propagate-at-launch - Accepts a Boolean value, which speci-
                   fies whether tags propagate to instances at launch. The re-
                   sults only include information about  the  tags  associated
                   with the specified Boolean value.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 If  you  specify multiple values for a filter, the values are
                 automatically logically joined with an OR , and  the  request
                 returns  all  results that match any of the specified values.
                 For example, specify "tag:environment" for  the  filter  name
                 and  "production,development"  for  the filter values to find
                 Auto Scaling groups with the tag "environment=production"  or
                 "environment=development".

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe all tags

       This example describes all your tags.

          aws autoscaling describe-tags

       Output:

          {
              "Tags": [
                  {
                      "ResourceType": "auto-scaling-group",
                      "ResourceId": "my-asg",
                      "PropagateAtLaunch": true,
                      "Value": "Research",
                      "Key": "Dept"
                  },
                  {
                      "ResourceType": "auto-scaling-group",
                      "ResourceId": "my-asg",
                      "PropagateAtLaunch": true,
                      "Value": "WebServer",
                      "Key": "Role"
                  }
              ]
          }

       the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.

       Example 2: To describe tags for a specified group

       To describe tags for a specific Auto Scaling group, use  the  --filters
       option.

          aws autoscaling describe-tags --filters Name=auto-scaling-group,Values=my-asg

       For  more information, see Tagging Auto Scaling groups and instances in
       the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.

       Example 3: To describe the specified number of tags

       To return a specific number of tags, use the --max-items option.

          aws autoscaling describe-tags \
              --max-items 1

       If the output includes a NextToken field, there are more tags.  To  get
       the  additional  tags,  use  the  value of this field with the --start-
       ing-token option in a subsequent call as follows.

          aws autoscaling describe-tags \
              --filters Name=auto-scaling-group,Values=my-asg \
              --starting-token Z3M3LMPEXAMPLE

       For more information, see Tagging Auto Scaling groups and instances  in
       the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.

              Describes a tag for an Auto Scaling group.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 The name of the group.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The  type of resource. The only supported value is auto-scal-
                 ing-group .

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag key.

              PropagateAtLaunch -> (boolean)
                 Determines whether the tag is added to new instances as  they
                 are launched in the group.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  string  that indicates that the response contains more items than
          can be returned in a single response. To receive  additional  items,
          specify this string for the NextToken value when requesting the next
          set of items. This value is null when there are no more items to re-
          turn.
