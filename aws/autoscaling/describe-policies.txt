DESCRIBE-POLICIES()                                        DESCRIBE-POLICIES()



NAME
       describe-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about the scaling policies in the account and Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-policies  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: ScalingPolicies

SYNOPSIS
            describe-policies
          [--auto-scaling-group-name <value>]
          [--policy-names <value>]
          [--policy-types <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --policy-names (list)
          The names of one or more policies. If you omit this  parameter,  all
          policies are described. If a group name is provided, the results are
          limited to that group. If you specify an unknown policy name, it  is
          ignored with no error.

          Array Members: Maximum number of 50 items.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --policy-types (list)
          One or more policy types. The valid values are SimpleScaling , Step-
          Scaling , TargetTrackingScaling , and PredictiveScaling .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       ing User Guide.

       Example 2: To describe the scaling policies of a specified name

       To return specific scaling policies, use the --policy-names option.

          aws autoscaling describe-policies \
              --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
              --policy-names cpu40-target-tracking-scaling-policy

       See example 1 for sample output.

       For  more information, see Dynamic scaling in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scal-
       ing User Guide.

       Example 3: To describe a number of scaling policies

       To return a specific number of policies, use the --max-items option.

          aws autoscaling describe-policies \
              --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
              --max-items 1

       See example 1 for sample output.

       If the output includes a NextToken field, use the value of  this  field
       with  the --starting-token option in a subsequent call to get the addi-
       tional policies.

          aws autoscaling describe-policies --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg --starting-token Z3M3LMPEXAMPLE

                 and Step and simple scaling policies in the Amazon  EC2  Auto
                 Scaling User Guide .

              AdjustmentType -> (string)
                 Specifies  how the scaling adjustment is interpreted (for ex-
                 ample, an absolute number or a percentage). The valid  values
                 are ChangeInCapacity , ExactCapacity , and PercentChangeInCa-
                 pacity .

              MinAdjustmentStep -> (integer)
                 Available for backward compatibility. Use MinAdjustmentMagni-
                 tude instead.

              MinAdjustmentMagnitude -> (integer)
                 The  minimum  value  to  scale by when the adjustment type is
                 PercentChangeInCapacity .

              ScalingAdjustment -> (integer)
                 The amount by which to scale, based on the specified  adjust-
                 ment  type.  A  positive  value  adds to the current capacity
                 while a negative number removes from the current capacity.

              Cooldown -> (integer)
                 The duration of the policy's cooldown period, in seconds.

              StepAdjustments -> (list)
                 A set of adjustments that enable you to scale  based  on  the
                 size of the alarm breach.

                 (structure)
                     Describes  information  used  to create a step adjustment
                     for a step scaling policy.

                     For the following examples,  suppose  that  you  have  an
                     alarm with a breach threshold of 50:

                     o To  trigger  the  adjustment when the metric is greater
                       than or equal to 50 and less than 60, specify  a  lower
                       bound of 0 and an upper bound of 10.

                     o To  trigger  the  adjustment when the metric is greater
                       than 40 and less than or equal to 50, specify  a  lower
                       bound of -10 and an upper bound of 0.

                     There  are  a few rules for the step adjustments for your
                     step policy:

                     o The ranges of your step adjustments  can't  overlap  or
                       have a gap.

                     o At  most,  one  step  adjustment  can have a null lower
                       bound. If one step  adjustment  has  a  negative  lower
                       bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null
                       lower bound.

                     o At most, one step adjustment  can  have  a  null  upper
                       bound.  If  one  step  adjustment  has a positive upper
                       bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null
                       upper bound.

                     o The  upper  and  lower  bound can't be null in the same
                       step adjustment.

                     For more information, see Step adjustments in the  Amazon
                     EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

                     MetricIntervalLowerBound -> (double)
                        The  lower  bound for the difference between the alarm
                        threshold and the CloudWatch  metric.  If  the  metric
                        value  is  above the breach threshold, the lower bound
                        is inclusive (the metric must be greater than or equal
                        to  the threshold plus the lower bound). Otherwise, it
                        is exclusive (the metric  must  be  greater  than  the
                        threshold  plus  the  lower bound). A null value indi-
                        cates negative infinity.

                     MetricIntervalUpperBound -> (double)
                        The upper bound for the difference between  the  alarm
                        threshold  and  the  CloudWatch  metric. If the metric
                        value is above the breach threshold, the  upper  bound
                        is exclusive (the metric must be less than the thresh-
                        old plus the upper bound). Otherwise, it is  inclusive
                        (the  metric must be less than or equal to the thresh-
                        old plus the upper bound). A null value indicates pos-
                        itive infinity.

                        The upper bound must be greater than the lower bound.

                     ScalingAdjustment -> (integer)
                        The  amount  by which to scale, based on the specified
                        adjustment type. A positive value adds to the  current
                        capacity while a negative number removes from the cur-
                        rent capacity.

              MetricAggregationType -> (string)
                 The aggregation type for the CloudWatch  metrics.  The  valid
                 values are Minimum , Maximum , and Average .

              EstimatedInstanceWarmup -> (integer)
                 The  estimated  time,  in seconds, until a newly launched in-
                 stance can contribute to the CloudWatch metrics.

              Alarms -> (list)
                 The CloudWatch alarms related to the policy.

                 (structure)
                     Describes an alarm.

                     AlarmName -> (string)
                        The name of the alarm.

                     AlarmARN -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the alarm.

              TargetTrackingConfiguration -> (structure)
                 A target tracking scaling policy.

                 PredefinedMetricSpecification -> (structure)
                     A predefined metric. You must specify either a predefined
                     metric or a customized metric.

                     PredefinedMetricType -> (string)
                        The  metric type. The following predefined metrics are
                        available:

                        o ASGAverageCPUUtilization - Average  CPU  utilization
                          of the Auto Scaling group.

                        o ASGAverageNetworkIn  -  Average  number of bytes re-
                          ceived on all network interfaces by the Auto Scaling
                          group.

                        o ASGAverageNetworkOut  - Average number of bytes sent
                          out on all network interfaces by  the  Auto  Scaling
                          group.

                        o ALBRequestCountPerTarget  - Average Application Load
                          Balancer request count  per  target  for  your  Auto
                          Scaling group.

                     ResourceLabel -> (string)
                        A  label  that uniquely identifies a specific Applica-
                        tion Load Balancer target group from which  to  deter-
                        mine  the  average  request  count served by your Auto
                        Scaling group. You can't specify a resource label  un-
                        less  the target group is attached to the Auto Scaling
                        group.

                        You create the resource label by appending  the  final
                        portion of the load balancer ARN and the final portion
                        of the target group ARN into a single value, separated
                        by a forward slash (/). The format of the resource la-
                        bel is:
                            app/my-alb/778d41231b141a0f/target-
                            group/my-alb-target-group/943f017f100becff .

                        Where:

                        o app/<load-balancer-name>/<load-balancer-id>  is  the
                          final portion of the load balancer ARN

                        o targetgroup/<target-group-name>/<target-group-id> is
                          the final portion of the target group ARN.

                        To  find the ARN for an Application Load Balancer, use
                        the DescribeLoadBalancers API operation. To  find  the
                        ARN for the target group, use the DescribeTargetGroups
                        API operation.

                 CustomizedMetricSpecification -> (structure)
                     A customized metric. You must specify either a predefined
                     metric or a customized metric.

                     MetricName -> (string)
                        The  name of the metric. To get the exact metric name,
                        namespace, and dimensions, inspect the  Metric  object
                        that is returned by a call to ListMetrics .

                     Namespace -> (string)
                        The namespace of the metric.

                     Dimensions -> (list)
                        The dimensions of the metric.

                        Conditional:  If you published your metric with dimen-
                        sions, you must specify the same  dimensions  in  your
                        scaling policy.

                        (structure)
                            Describes the dimension of a metric.

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the dimension.

                            Value -> (string)
                               The value of the dimension.

                     Statistic -> (string)
                        The statistic of the metric.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        The  unit  of  the  metric. For a complete list of the
                        units that CloudWatch supports,  see  the  MetricDatum
                        data type in the Amazon CloudWatch API Reference .

                 TargetValue -> (double)
                     The target value for the metric.

                     NOTE:
                        Some  metrics  are  based on a count instead of a per-
                        centage, such as the request count for an  Application
                        Load  Balancer  or  the  number  of messages in an SQS
                        queue. If the scaling policy specifies  one  of  these
                        metrics, specify the target utilization as the optimal
                        average request or message count per  instance  during
                        any one-minute interval.

                 DisableScaleIn -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether scaling in by the target tracking scal-
                     ing policy is disabled. If scaling in  is  disabled,  the
                     target  tracking  scaling policy doesn't remove instances
                     from the Auto Scaling group. Otherwise, the target track-
                     ing  scaling  policy  can  remove instances from the Auto
                     Scaling group. The default is false .

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the policy is enabled (true )  or  disabled
                 (false ).

              PredictiveScalingConfiguration -> (structure)
                 A predictive scaling policy.

                 MetricSpecifications -> (list)
                     This  structure  includes the metrics and target utiliza-
                     tion to use for predictive scaling.

                     This is an array, but we currently only support a  single
                     metric  specification.  That is, you can specify a target
                     value and a single metric pair, or a target value and one
                     scaling metric and one load metric.

                     (structure)
                        This  structure  specifies the metrics and target uti-
                        lization settings for a predictive scaling policy.

                        You must specify either a metric pair, or a load  met-
                        ric  and  a  scaling metric individually. Specifying a
                        metric pair instead of individual metrics  provides  a
                        simpler way to configure metrics for a scaling policy.
                        You choose the metric pair, and the  policy  automati-
                        cally  knows the correct sum and average statistics to
                        use for the load metric and the scaling metric.

                        Example

                        o You create a predictive scaling policy  and  specify
                          ALBRequestCount as the value for the metric pair and
                          1000.0 as the target value. For this type of metric,
                          you must provide the metric dimension for the corre-
                          sponding target group, so you  also  provide  a  re-
                          source  label for the Application Load Balancer tar-
                          get group that is  attached  to  your  Auto  Scaling
                          group.

                        o The number of requests the target group receives per
                          minute provides the load  metric,  and  the  request
                          count  averaged  between  the  members of the target
                          group provides the scaling  metric.  In  CloudWatch,
                          this refers to the RequestCount and RequestCountPer-
                          Target metrics, respectively.

                        o For optimal use of predictive scaling, you adhere to
                          the  best practice of using a dynamic scaling policy
                          to automatically scale between the minimum  capacity
                          and   maximum  capacity  in  response  to  real-time
                          changes in resource utilization.

                        o Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling consumes data points for the
                          load  metric  over  the  last 14 days and creates an
                          hourly load forecast for predictive scaling. (A min-
                          imum of 24 hours of data is required.)

                        o After  creating  the  load forecast, Amazon EC2 Auto
                          Scaling determines when to reduce  or  increase  the
                          capacity  of your Auto Scaling group in each hour of
                          the forecast period so that the  average  number  of
                          requests  received  by  each instance is as close to
                          1000 requests per minute as possible at all times.

                        dictive  scaling, see Advanced predictive scaling pol-
                        icy configurations using custom metrics in the  Amazon
                        EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

                        TargetValue -> (double)
                            Specifies the target utilization.

                            NOTE:
                               Some  metrics are based on a count instead of a
                               percentage, such as the request  count  for  an
                               Application Load Balancer or the number of mes-
                               sages in an SQS queue. If  the  scaling  policy
                               specifies  one  of  these  metrics, specify the
                               target utilization as the optimal  average  re-
                               quest  or message count per instance during any
                               one-minute interval.

                        PredefinedMetricPairSpecification -> (structure)
                            The  predefined  metric  pair  specification  from
                            which  Amazon  EC2 Auto Scaling determines the ap-
                            propriate scaling metric and load metric to use.

                            PredefinedMetricType -> (string)
                               Indicates which metrics to use. There  are  two
                               different  types  of  metrics  for  each metric
                               type: one is a load metric and one is a scaling
                               metric.  For example, if the metric type is AS-
                               GCPUUtilization , the Auto Scaling group's  to-
                               tal  CPU metric is used as the load metric, and
                               the average CPU metric is used for the  scaling
                               metric.

                            ResourceLabel -> (string)
                               A label that uniquely identifies a specific Ap-
                               plication Load Balancer target group from which
                               to  determine  the  total  and  average request
                               count served by your Auto  Scaling  group.  You
                               can't  specify a resource label unless the tar-
                               get group  is  attached  to  the  Auto  Scaling
                               group.

                               You  create the resource label by appending the
                               final portion of the load balancer ARN and  the
                               final  portion  of  the target group ARN into a
                               single value, separated by a forward slash (/).
                               The format of the resource label is:
                                   app/my-alb/778d41231b141a0f/target-
                                   group/my-alb-target-group/943f017f100becff
                                   .

                               Where:

                               o app/<load-balancer-name>/<load-balancer-id>
                                 is the final portion of the load balancer ARN

                               o targetgroup/<target-group-name>/<tar-
                                 get-group-id>  is  the  final  portion of the
                                 target group ARN.

                               To find the ARN for an  Application  Load  Bal-
                               ancer, use the DescribeLoadBalancers API opera-
                               tion. To find the ARN for the target group, use
                               the DescribeTargetGroups API operation.

                        PredefinedScalingMetricSpecification -> (structure)
                            The predefined scaling metric specification.

                            PredefinedMetricType -> (string)
                               The metric type.

                            ResourceLabel -> (string)
                               A label that uniquely identifies a specific Ap-
                               plication Load Balancer target group from which
                               to  determine  the average request count served
                               by your Auto Scaling group. You can't specify a
                               resource  label  unless the target group is at-
                               tached to the Auto Scaling group.

                               You create the resource label by appending  the
                               final  portion of the load balancer ARN and the
                               final portion of the target group  ARN  into  a
                               single value, separated by a forward slash (/).
                               The format of the resource label is:
                                   app/my-alb/778d41231b141a0f/target-

                               You  create the resource label by appending the
                               final portion of the load balancer ARN and  the
                               final  portion  of  the target group ARN into a
                               single value, separated by a forward slash (/).
                               The format of the resource label is:
                                   app/my-alb/778d41231b141a0f/target-
                                   group/my-alb-target-group/943f017f100becff
                                   .

                               Where:

                               o app/<load-balancer-name>/<load-balancer-id>
                                 is the final portion of the load balancer ARN

                               o targetgroup/<target-group-name>/<tar-
                                 get-group-id>  is  the  final  portion of the
                                 target group ARN.

                               To find the ARN for an  Application  Load  Bal-
                               ancer, use the DescribeLoadBalancers API opera-
                               tion. To find the ARN for the target group, use
                               the DescribeTargetGroups API operation.

                                      or expression. This is especially useful
                                      if this is a math  expression,  so  that
                                      you know what the value represents.

                                   ReturnData -> (boolean)
                                      Indicates  whether  to  return the time-

                                      ric.

                                      If you use any math expressions, specify
                                      true for this value for only  the  final
                                      math expression that the metric specifi-
                                      cation is based  on.  You  must  specify
                                      false  for  ReturnData for all the other
                                      metrics and expressions used in the met-
                                      ric specification.

                                      If  you  are only retrieving metrics and
                                      not performing any math expressions,  do
                                      not  specify  anything  for ReturnData .
                                      This sets it to its default (true ).

                                          The  most  commonly used metrics for
                                          predictive scaling are  Average  and
                                          Sum .

                                   Label -> (string)
                                      A  human-readable  label for this metric
                                      or expression. This is especially useful
                                      if  this  is  a math expression, so that
                                      you know what the value represents.

                                   ReturnData -> (boolean)
                                      Indicates whether to  return  the  time-
                                      stamps  and raw data values of this met-
                                      ric.

                                      If you use any math expressions, specify
                                      true  for  this value for only the final
                                      math expression that the metric specifi-
                                      cation  is  based  on.  You must specify
                                      false for ReturnData for all  the  other
                                      metrics and expressions used in the met-
                                      ric specification.

                                      If you are only retrieving  metrics  and
                                      not  performing any math expressions, do
                                      not specify anything  for  ReturnData  .
                                      This sets it to its default (true ).

                        CustomizedCapacityMetricSpecification -> (structure)
                            The customized capacity metric specification.

                            MetricDataQueries -> (list)
                               One  or more metric data queries to provide the
                               data points for a capacity metric. Use multiple
                               metric  data queries only if you are performing
                               a math expression on returned data.

                               (structure)
                                   The metric data  to  return.  Also  defines
                                   whether this call is returning data for one
                                   metric only, or whether it is performing  a
                                   math  expression  on the values of returned
                                   metric statistics to create a new time  se-
                                   ries.  A  time  series  is a series of data
                                   points, each of which is associated with  a
                                   timestamp.

                                             Conditional:  If  you   published
                                             your  metric with dimensions, you
                                             must specify the same  dimensions
                                             in your scaling policy.

                                             (structure)
                                                 Describes  the dimension of a
                                                 metric.

                                                 Name -> (string)
                                                    The name of the dimension.

                                                 Value -> (string)
                                                    The value  of  the  dimen-
                                                    sion.

                                      Stat -> (string)
                                          The  statistic to return. It can in-
                                          clude any  CloudWatch  statistic  or
                                          extended  statistic.  For  a list of
                                          valid  values,  see  the  table   in

                                          The most commonly used  metrics  for
                                          predictive  scaling  are Average and
                                          Sum .

                                      Unit -> (string)
                                          The unit to  use  for  the  returned
                                          data  points. For a complete list of
                                          the units that CloudWatch  supports,
                                          see the MetricDatum data type in the
                                          Amazon CloudWatch API Reference .

                                   Label -> (string)
                                      A human-readable label for  this  metric
                                      or expression. This is especially useful
                                      if this is a math  expression,  so  that
                                      you know what the value represents.

                                   ReturnData -> (boolean)
                                      Indicates  whether  to  return the time-
                                      stamps and raw data values of this  met-
                                      ric.

                                      If you use any math expressions, specify
                                      true for this value for only  the  final
                                      math expression that the metric specifi-
                                      cation is based  on.  You  must  specify
                                      false  for  ReturnData for all the other
                                      metrics and expressions used in the met-
                                      ric specification.

                                      If  you  are only retrieving metrics and
                                      not performing any math expressions,  do
                                      not  specify  anything  for ReturnData .
                                      This sets it to its default (true ).

                 Mode -> (string)
                     The predictive scaling mode. Defaults to ForecastOnly  if
                     not specified.

                 SchedulingBufferTime -> (integer)
                     The  amount  of  time,  in seconds, by which the instance
                     launch time can be advanced. For  example,  the  forecast
                     says  to  add  capacity  at  10:00  AM, and you choose to
                     pre-launch instances by 5 minutes. In that case, the  in-
                     stances  will be launched at 9:55 AM. The intention is to
                     give resources time to be provisioned. It can take a  few
                     minutes  to  launch an EC2 instance. The actual amount of
                     time required depends on several  factors,  such  as  the
                     size  of  the  instance  and  whether  there  are startup
                     scripts to complete.

                     The value must be less than the forecast  interval  dura-
                     tion  of  3600 seconds (60 minutes). Defaults to 300 sec-
                     onds if not specified.

                 MaxCapacityBreachBehavior -> (string)
                     Defines the behavior that should be applied if the  fore-
                     cast  capacity approaches or exceeds the maximum capacity
                     of the Auto Scaling group. Defaults  to  HonorMaxCapacity
                     if not specified.

                     The following are possible values:

                     o HonorMaxCapacity - Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling cannot scale
                       out capacity higher than the maximum capacity. The max-
                       imum capacity is enforced as a hard limit.

                     o IncreaseMaxCapacity - Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can scale
                       out capacity higher than the maximum capacity when  the
                       forecast  capacity  is  close to or exceeds the maximum
                       capacity. The upper limit is determined  by  the  fore-
                       casted capacity and the value for MaxCapacityBuffer .

                 MaxCapacityBuffer -> (integer)
                     The  size of the capacity buffer to use when the forecast
                     capacity is close to or exceeds the maximum capacity. The
                     value  is specified as a percentage relative to the fore-
                     cast capacity. For example, if the  buffer  is  10,  this
                     means  a 10 percent buffer, such that if the forecast ca-
                     pacity is 50, and the maximum capacity is  40,  then  the
                     effective maximum capacity is 55.

                     If  set  to 0, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling may scale capacity
                     higher than the maximum capacity to equal but not  exceed
                     forecast capacity.

                     Required if the MaxCapacityBreachBehavior property is set
                     to IncreaseMaxCapacity , and cannot be used otherwise.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A string that indicates that the response contains more  items  than
          can  be  returned in a single response. To receive additional items,
          specify this string for the NextToken value when requesting the next
          set of items. This value is null when there are no more items to re-
          turn.
