START-INSTANCE-REFRESH()                              START-INSTANCE-REFRESH()



NAME
       start-instance-refresh -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts an instance refresh.

       This  operation  is  part of the instance refresh feature in Amazon EC2
       Auto Scaling, which helps you update instances  in  your  Auto  Scaling
       group. This feature is helpful, for example, when you have a new AMI or
       a new user data script. You just need to create a new  launch  template
       that  specifies the new AMI or user data script. Then start an instance
       refresh to immediately begin the process of updating instances  in  the
       group.

       If successful, the request's response contains a unique ID that you can
       use to track the progress of the instance refresh. To query its status,
       call  the   DescribeInstanceRefreshes API. To describe the instance re-
       freshes that have already run, call the  DescribeInstanceRefreshes API.
       To  cancel  an instance refresh that is in progress, use the  CancelIn-
       stanceRefresh API.

       An instance refresh might fail for several reasons, such as EC2  launch
       failures,  misconfigured health checks, or not ignoring or allowing the
       termination of instances that are in Standby state  or  protected  from
       scale in. You can monitor for failed EC2 launches using the scaling ac-
       tivities. To find the scaling activities, call the   DescribeScalingAc-
       tivities API.

       If  you  enable  auto  rollback, your Auto Scaling group will be rolled
       back automatically when the instance refresh fails. You can enable this
       feature before starting an instance refresh by specifying the AutoRoll-
       back property in the instance refresh preferences. Otherwise,  to  roll
       back  an  instance  refresh  before  it  finishes, use the  RollbackIn-
       stanceRefresh API.

OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --strategy (string)
          The strategy to use for the instance refresh. The only  valid  value
          is Rolling .

          Possible values:

          o Rolling

       --desired-configuration (structure)
          The  desired  configuration.  For example, the desired configuration
          can specify a new launch template or a new version  of  the  current
          launch template.

          Once  the instance refresh succeeds, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling updates
          the settings of the Auto Scaling group to reflect  the  new  desired
          configuration.

          NOTE:
              When  you  specify a new launch template or a new version of the
              current launch template for your desired configuration, consider
              enabling  the  SkipMatching property in preferences. If it's en-
              abled, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling skips  replacing  instances  that
              already  use  the  specified launch template and instance types.
              This can help you reduce the number of replacements that are re-
              quired to apply updates.

          LaunchTemplate -> (structure)
              Describes the launch template and the version of the launch tem-
              plate that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses to launch Amazon EC2 in-
              stances. For more information about launch templates, see Launch
              templates in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

              LaunchTemplateId -> (string)
                 The ID of the launch template. To get the  template  ID,  use
                 the  Amazon  EC2  DescribeLaunchTemplates  API operation. New
                 launch  templates  can  be  created  using  the  Amazon   EC2
                 CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                 Conditional:  You must specify either a LaunchTemplateId or a
                 LaunchTemplateName .

              LaunchTemplateName -> (string)
                 The name of the launch template. To get  the  template  name,
                 use the Amazon EC2 DescribeLaunchTemplates API operation. New
                 launch  templates  can  be  created  using  the  Amazon   EC2
                 CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                 Conditional:  You must specify either a LaunchTemplateId or a
                 LaunchTemplateName .

              Version -> (string)
                 The version number, $Latest , or $Default . To get  the  ver-
                 sion       number,       use       the       Amazon       EC2
                 DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions API operation. New launch tem-
                 plate   versions   can   be  created  using  the  Amazon  EC2
                 CreateLaunchTemplateVersion API. If the value  is  $Latest  ,
                 Amazon  EC2  Auto  Scaling  selects the latest version of the
                 launch template when launching instances.  If  the  value  is
                 $Default  ,  Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling selects the default ver-
                 sion of the launch template when launching instances. The de-
                 fault value is $Default .

          MixedInstancesPolicy -> (structure)
              Use  this structure to launch multiple instance types and On-De-
              mand Instances and Spot Instances within a single  Auto  Scaling
              group.

              A  mixed  instances  policy contains information that Amazon EC2
              Auto Scaling can use to launch instances and help optimize  your
              costs. For more information, see Auto Scaling groups with multi-
              ple instance types and purchase options in the Amazon  EC2  Auto
              Scaling User Guide .

              LaunchTemplate -> (structure)
                 One  or  more  launch templates and the instance types (over-
                 rides) that are used  to  launch  EC2  instances  to  fulfill
                 On-Demand and Spot capacities.

                 LaunchTemplateSpecification -> (structure)
                     The launch template.

                     LaunchTemplateId -> (string)
                        The ID of the launch template. To get the template ID,
                        use the Amazon EC2 DescribeLaunchTemplates API  opera-
                        tion.  New  launch  templates can be created using the
                        Amazon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                        Conditional: You  must  specify  either  a  LaunchTem-
                        plateId or a LaunchTemplateName .

                     LaunchTemplateName -> (string)
                        The  name  of the launch template. To get the template
                        name, use the Amazon EC2  DescribeLaunchTemplates  API
                        operation.  New  launch templates can be created using
                        the Amazon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                        Conditional: You  must  specify  either  a  LaunchTem-
                        plateId or a LaunchTemplateName .

                     Version -> (string)
                        The version number, $Latest , or $Default . To get the
                        version     number,     use     the     Amazon     EC2
                        DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions   API   operation.  New
                        launch template versions can be created using the Ama-
                        zon  EC2 CreateLaunchTemplateVersion API. If the value
                        is $Latest , Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling selects the  lat-
                        est  version of the launch template when launching in-
                        stances. If the value is $Default ,  Amazon  EC2  Auto
                        Scaling selects the default version of the launch tem-
                        plate when launching instances. The default  value  is
                        $Default .

                 Overrides -> (list)
                     Any properties that you specify override the same proper-
                     ties in the launch template.

                     (structure)
                        Use this structure to let Amazon EC2 Auto  Scaling  do
                        the  following when the Auto Scaling group has a mixed
                        instances policy:

                        o Override the instance type that is specified in  the
                          launch template.

                        o Use multiple instance types.

                        Specify  the  instance  types that you want, or define
                        your instance requirements instead and let Amazon  EC2
                        Auto  Scaling  provision  the available instance types
                        that meet your requirements. This can  provide  Amazon
                        EC2  Auto  Scaling with a larger selection of instance
                        types to choose from when fulfilling Spot  and  On-De-
                        mand capacities. You can view which instance types are
                        matched before you apply the instance requirements  to
                        your Auto Scaling group.

                        After you define your instance requirements, you don't
                        have to keep updating these settings to  get  new  EC2
                        instance  types automatically. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
                        uses the instance requirements  of  the  Auto  Scaling
                        group to determine whether a new EC2 instance type can
                        be used.

                        InstanceType -> (string)
                            The instance type, such as m3.xlarge  .  You  must
                            specify an instance type that is supported in your
                            requested Region and Availability Zones. For  more
                            information,  see  Instance  types  in  the Amazon
                            Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

                            You can specify up to 40 instance types  per  Auto
                            Scaling group.

                        WeightedCapacity -> (string)
                            If  you  provide  a list of instance types to use,
                            you can specify the number of capacity units  pro-
                            vided  by  each  instance type in terms of virtual
                            CPUs, memory, storage, throughput, or other  rela-
                            tive  performance  characteristic.  When a Spot or
                            On-Demand Instance is launched, the capacity units
                            count toward the desired capacity. Amazon EC2 Auto
                            Scaling launches instances until the  desired  ca-
                            pacity  is totally fulfilled, even if this results
                            in an overage. For example, if there are two units
                            remaining to fulfill capacity, and Amazon EC2 Auto
                            Scaling can only launch an instance with a Weight-
                            edCapacity   of   five   units,  the  instance  is
                            launched, and the desired capacity is exceeded  by
                            three units. For more information, see Configuring
                            instance weighting for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling  in
                            the  Amazon  EC2  Auto  Scaling User Guide . Value
                            must be in the range of 1999.

                            If you specify a value  for  WeightedCapacity  for
                            one  instance  type,  you must specify a value for
                            WeightedCapacity for all of them.

                            WARNING:
                               Every Auto Scaling group has three size parame-
                               ters  (DesiredCapacity  , MaxSize , and MinSize
                               ). Usually, you set these sizes based on a spe-
                               cific number of instances. However, if you con-
                               figure a mixed instances  policy  that  defines
                               weights  for the instance types, you must spec-
                               ify these sizes with the same  units  that  you
                               use for weighting instances.

                        LaunchTemplateSpecification -> (structure)
                            Provides  a  launch template for the specified in-
                            stance type or set of instance  requirements.  For
                            example,  some  instance  types  might  require  a
                            launch template with a different AMI. If not  pro-
                            vided,  Amazon  EC2  Auto  Scaling uses the launch
                            template that's specified  in  the  LaunchTemplate
                            definition. For more information, see Specifying a
                            different launch template for an instance type  in
                            the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

                            You can specify up to 20 launch templates per Auto
                            Scaling group. The launch templates  specified  in
                            the overrides and in the LaunchTemplate definition
                            count towards this limit.

                            LaunchTemplateId -> (string)
                               The ID of the launch template. To get the  tem-
                               plate     ID,     use     the     Amazon    EC2
                               DescribeLaunchTemplates  API   operation.   New
                               launch  templates can be created using the Ama-
                               zon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                               Conditional:  You   must   specify   either   a
                               LaunchTemplateId or a LaunchTemplateName .

                            LaunchTemplateName -> (string)
                               The  name  of  the  launch template. To get the
                               template   name,    use    the    Amazon    EC2
                               DescribeLaunchTemplates   API   operation.  New
                               launch templates can be created using the  Ama-
                               zon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                               Conditional:   You   must   specify   either  a
                               LaunchTemplateId or a LaunchTemplateName .

                            Version -> (string)
                               The version number, $Latest , or $Default .  To
                               get  the  version  number,  use  the Amazon EC2
                               DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions  API  operation.
                               New launch template versions can be created us-
                               ing the Amazon EC2  CreateLaunchTemplateVersion
                               API.  If the value is $Latest , Amazon EC2 Auto
                               Scaling  selects  the  latest  version  of  the
                               launch  template  when  launching instances. If
                               the value is $Default , Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
                               selects  the default version of the launch tem-
                               plate when  launching  instances.  The  default
                               value is $Default .

                        InstanceRequirements -> (structure)
                            The instance requirements. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
                            uses your specified requirements to  identify  in-
                            stance  types.  Then,  it  uses your On-Demand and
                            Spot allocation  strategies  to  launch  instances
                            from these instance types.

                            You  can  specify  up to four separate sets of in-
                            stance requirements per Auto Scaling  group.  This
                            is  useful for provisioning instances from differ-
                            ent Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) in the same  Auto
                            Scaling  group.  To  do  this, create the AMIs and
                            create a new launch template for each  AMI.  Then,
                            create  a  compatible set of instance requirements
                            for each launch template.

                            NOTE:
                               If you specify InstanceRequirements , you can't
                               specify InstanceType .

                            VCpuCount -> (structure)
                               The  minimum and maximum number of vCPUs for an
                               instance type.

                               Min -> (integer)
                                   The minimum number of vCPUs.

                                   The maximum number of vCPUs.

                            MemoryMiB -> (structure)
                               The minimum and maximum  instance  memory  size
                               for an instance type, in MiB.

                               Min -> (integer)
                                   The memory minimum in MiB.

                               Max -> (integer)
                                   The memory maximum in MiB.

                            CpuManufacturers -> (list)
                               Lists  which  specific CPU manufacturers to in-

                               o For instance types with Intel  CPUs,  specify
                                 intel .

                               o For instance types with AMD CPUs, specify amd

                               o For instance types with Amazon  Web  Services
                                 CPUs, specify amazon-web-services .

                               NOTE:
                                   Don't confuse the CPU hardware manufacturer
                                   with the  CPU  hardware  architecture.  In-
                                   stances  will be launched with a compatible
                                   CPU architecture based on  the  Amazon  Ma-
                                   chine  Image (AMI) that you specify in your
                                   launch template.

                               Default: Any manufacturer

                            MemoryGiBPerVCpu -> (structure)
                               The minimum and maximum amount  of  memory  per
                               vCPU for an instance type, in GiB.

                               Default: No minimum or maximum limits

                               Min -> (double)
                                   The memory minimum in GiB.

                               Max -> (double)
                                   The memory maximum in GiB.

                            ExcludedInstanceTypes -> (list)
                               The  instance  types  to  exclude.  You can use
                               strings with one or  more  wild  cards,  repre-
                               sented  by  an asterisk (* ), to exclude an in-
                               stance family, type, size, or  generation.  The
                               following  are  examples:  m5.8xlarge , c5*.* ,
                               m5a.* , r* , *3* .

                               For example, if you specify c5* , you  are  ex-
                               cluding  the  entire  C5 instance family, which
                               includes all C5a and C5n instance types. If you
                               specify  m5a.*  ,  Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will
                               exclude all the M5a instance types, but not the
                               M5n instance types.

                               NOTE:
                                   If  you specify ExcludedInstanceTypes , you
                                   can't specify AllowedInstanceTypes .

                               Default: No excluded instance types

                            InstanceGenerations -> (list)
                               Indicates whether current or  previous  genera-
                               tion instance types are included.

                               o For  current generation instance types, spec-
                                 ify current . The current generation includes
                                 EC2  instance types currently recommended for
                                 use. This typically includes the  latest  two
                                 to three generations in each instance family.
                                 For more information, see Instance  types  in

                               with your specified attributes. If  no  current
                               generation  C,  M,  or  R instance type matches
                               your attributes, then the identified  price  is
                               from  either  the lowest priced current genera-

                               whose price exceeds your specified threshold.

                               The  parameter accepts an integer, which Amazon
                               EC2 Auto Scaling interprets as a percentage.

                               If you set DesiredCapacityType to vcpu or  mem-
                               ory-mib  ,  the  price  protection threshold is
                               based on the per-vCPU or per-memory  price  in-
                               stead of the per instance price.

                               NOTE:

                               Min -> (double)
                                   The minimum amount of network bandwidth, in
                                   gigabits per second (Gbps).

                               Max -> (double)

                               The  instance types to apply your specified at-
                               tributes against. All other instance types  are
                               ignored,  even if they match your specified at-
                               tributes.

                               You can use  strings  with  one  or  more  wild
                               cards,  represented by an asterisk (* ), to al-
                               low an instance type, size, or generation.  The
                               following  are  examples:  m5.8xlarge , c5*.* ,
                               m5a.* , r* , *3* .

                               For example, if you specify c5*  ,  Amazon  EC2
                               Auto  Scaling will allow the entire C5 instance
                               family, which includes all C5a and C5n instance
                               types.  If  you specify m5a.* , Amazon EC2 Auto
                               Scaling will allow all the M5a instance  types,
                               but not the M5n instance types.

                               NOTE:
                                   If  you  specify AllowedInstanceTypes , you
                                   can't specify ExcludedInstanceTypes .

                               Default: All instance types

                               (string)

              InstancesDistribution -> (structure)
                 The instances distribution.

                 OnDemandAllocationStrategy -> (string)
                     The allocation strategy to apply to  your  On-Demand  In-
                     stances  when  they are launched. Possible instance types
                     are determined by the launch template overrides that  you
                     specify.

                     The following lists the valid values:
                        lowest-price

                     Uses  price  to  determine  which  instance types are the
                     highest priority, launching the  lowest  priced  instance
                     types  within an Availability Zone first. This is the de-
                     fault value for Auto Scaling  groups  that  specify   In-
                     stanceRequirements .
                        prioritized

                     You  set  the order of instance types for the launch tem-
                     plate overrides from highest  to  lowest  priority  (from
                     first  to  last  in  the  list).  Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
                     launches your highest priority instance types  first.  If
                     all  your  On-Demand  capacity  cannot be fulfilled using
                     your highest priority instance type, then Amazon EC2 Auto
                     Scaling  launches the remaining capacity using the second
                     priority instance type, and so on. This  is  the  default
                     value  for  Auto  Scaling  groups that don't specify  In-
                     stanceRequirements and cannot be used for groups that do.

                 OnDemandBaseCapacity -> (integer)
                     The minimum amount of the Auto Scaling  group's  capacity
                     that  must be fulfilled by On-Demand Instances. This base
                     portion is launched first as your group scales.

                     This number has the  same  unit  of  measurement  as  the
                     group's  desired capacity. If you change the default unit
                     of  measurement  (number  of  instances)  by   specifying
                     weighted  capacity  values  in your launch template over-
                     rides list, or by changing the default  desired  capacity
                     type  setting  of the group, you must specify this number
                     using the same unit of measurement.

                     Default: 0

                 OnDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity -> (integer)
                     Controls the percentages of On-Demand Instances and  Spot
                     Instances  for  your additional capacity beyond OnDemand-
                     BaseCapacity . Expressed as a  number  (for  example,  20
                     specifies  20%  On-Demand Instances, 80% Spot Instances).
                     If set to 100, only On-Demand Instances are used.

                     Default: 100

                 SpotAllocationStrategy -> (string)
                     The allocation strategy to apply to your  Spot  Instances
                     when  they  are launched. Possible instance types are de-
                     termined by the launch template overrides that you  spec-
                     ify.

                     The following lists the valid values:
                        capacity-optimized

                     Requests  Spot  Instances  using pools that are optimally
                     chosen based on the available Spot capacity. This  strat-
                     egy  has the lowest risk of interruption. To give certain
                     instance types a higher chance of  launching  first,  use
                     capacity-optimized-prioritized .
                        capacity-optimized-prioritized

                     You  set  the order of instance types for the launch tem-
                     plate overrides from highest  to  lowest  priority  (from
                     first  to last in the list). Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling hon-
                     ors the instance type priorities on a best  effort  basis
                     but optimizes for capacity first. Note that if the On-De-
                     mand allocation strategy is set to prioritized , the same
                     priority  is  applied when fulfilling On-Demand capacity.
                     This is not a valid value for Auto  Scaling  groups  that
                     specify  InstanceRequirements .
                        lowest-price

                     Requests  Spot  Instances  using  the lowest priced pools
                     within an Availability Zone, across the  number  of  Spot
                     pools  that  you  specify for the SpotInstancePools prop-
                     erty. To ensure that your desired capacity  is  met,  you
                     might  receive Spot Instances from several pools. This is
                     the default value, but it might lead to high interruption
                     rates because this strategy only considers instance price
                     and not available capacity.
                        price-capacity-optimized (recommended)

                     The price  and  capacity  optimized  allocation  strategy
                     looks  at  both price and capacity to select the Spot In-
                     stance pools that are the least likely to be  interrupted
                     and have the lowest possible price.

                 SpotInstancePools -> (integer)
                     The  number  of Spot Instance pools across which to allo-
                     cate your Spot Instances. The Spot pools  are  determined
                     from the different instance types in the overrides. Valid
                     only when the SpotAllocationStrategy  is  lowest-price  .
                     Value must be in the range of 120.

                     Default: 2

                 SpotMaxPrice -> (string)
                     The  maximum  price per unit hour that you are willing to
                     pay for a Spot Instance. If your maximum price  is  lower
                     than  the  Spot price for the instance types that you se-
                     lected, your Spot Instances are not launched. We  do  not
                     recommend  specifying a maximum price because it can lead
                     to increased interruptions. When Spot  Instances  launch,
                     you pay the current Spot price. To remove a maximum price
                     that you previously set, include the property but specify
                     an empty string ("") for the value.

                     WARNING:
                        If you specify a maximum price, your instances will be
                        interrupted more frequently than if you do not specify
                        one.

       --preferences (structure)
          Sets  your  preferences for the instance refresh so that it performs
          as expected when you start it. Includes the  instance  warmup  time,
          the  minimum and maximum healthy percentages, and the behaviors that
          you want Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to use if  instances  that  are  in
          Standby  state  or  protected  from scale in are found. You can also
          choose to enable additional features, such as the following:

          o Auto rollback

          o Checkpoints

          o CloudWatch alarms

          o Skip matching

          MinHealthyPercentage -> (integer)
              Specifies the minimum percentage of the group to  keep  in  ser-
              vice,  healthy, and ready to use to support your workload to al-
              low the operation to continue. The value is expressed as a  per-
              centage of the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group. Value
              range is 0 to 100.

              If you do not specify this property, the default is 90  percent,
              or the percentage set in the instance maintenance policy for the
              Auto Scaling group, if defined.

          InstanceWarmup -> (integer)
              A time period, in seconds,  during  which  an  instance  refresh
              waits  before  moving  on to replacing the next instance after a
              new instance enters the InService state.

              This property is not required for normal usage. Instead, use the
              DefaultInstanceWarmup  property  of  the Auto Scaling group. The
              InstanceWarmup and  DefaultInstanceWarmup  properties  work  the
              same  way.  Only  specify this property if you must override the
              DefaultInstanceWarmup property.

              If you do not specify this property, the instance warmup by  de-
              fault is the value of the DefaultInstanceWarmup property, if de-
              fined (which is recommended in all cases), or  the  HealthCheck-
              GracePeriod property otherwise.

          CheckpointPercentages -> (list)
              (Optional) Threshold values for each checkpoint in ascending or-
              der. Each number must be unique. To replace all instances in the
              Auto Scaling group, the last number in the array must be 100 .

              For  usage  examples,  see Adding checkpoints to an instance re-
              fresh in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

              (integer)

          CheckpointDelay -> (integer)
              (Optional) The amount of time,  in  seconds,  to  wait  after  a
              checkpoint  before continuing. This property is optional, but if
              you specify a value for it, you must also specify  a  value  for
              CheckpointPercentages  .  If you specify a value for Checkpoint-
              Percentages and not for CheckpointDelay  ,  the  CheckpointDelay
              defaults to 3600 (1 hour).

          SkipMatching -> (boolean)
              (Optional)  Indicates  whether  skip matching is enabled. If en-
              abled (true ), then Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling skips replacing  in-
              stances that match the desired configuration. If no desired con-
              figuration is specified, then it skips replacing instances  that
              have  the  same launch template and instance types that the Auto
              Scaling group was using before the start  of  the  instance  re-
              fresh. The default is false .

              For  more  information,  see  Use  an instance refresh with skip
              matching in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

          AutoRollback -> (boolean)
              (Optional) Indicates whether to roll back the Auto Scaling group
              to its previous configuration if the instance refresh fails or a
              CloudWatch alarm threshold is met. The default is false .

              A rollback is not supported in the following situations:

              o There is no desired configuration specified for  the  instance
                refresh.

              o The Auto Scaling group has a launch template that uses an Ama-
                zon Web Services Systems Manager parameter instead of  an  AMI
                ID for the ImageId property.

              o The  Auto  Scaling group uses the launch template's $Latest or
                $Default version.

              For more information, see Undo changes with a  rollback  in  the
              Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

          ScaleInProtectedInstances -> (string)
              Choose the behavior that you want Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to use
              if instances protected from scale in are found.

              The following lists the valid values:
                 Refresh

              Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling replaces instances  that  are  protected
              from scale in.
                 Ignore

              Amazon  EC2  Auto  Scaling  ignores instances that are protected
              from scale in and continues to replace instances  that  are  not
              protected.
                 Wait (default)

              Amazon  EC2  Auto  Scaling  waits  one  hour  for  you to remove
              scale-in protection. Otherwise, the instance refresh will fail.

          StandbyInstances -> (string)
              Choose the behavior that you want Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to use
              if instances in Standby state are found.

              The following lists the valid values:
                 Terminate

              Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling terminates instances that are in Standby
              .
                 Ignore

              Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ignores instances that  are  in  Standby
              and  continues  to  replace  instances that are in the InService
              state.
                 Wait (default)

              Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits one hour for you to return the in-
              stances to service. Otherwise, the instance refresh will fail.

          AlarmSpecification -> (structure)
              (Optional) The CloudWatch alarm specification. CloudWatch alarms
              can be used to identify any issues and fail the operation if  an
              alarm threshold is met.

              Alarms -> (list)
                 The names of one or more CloudWatch alarms to monitor for the
                 instance refresh. You can specify up to 10 alarms.

                 (string)

          MaxHealthyPercentage -> (integer)
              Specifies the maximum percentage of the group  that  can  be  in
              service  and  healthy, or pending, to support your workload when
              replacing instances. The value is expressed as a  percentage  of
              the  desired  capacity of the Auto Scaling group. Value range is
              100 to 200.

              If you specify MaxHealthyPercentage , you must also specify Min-
              HealthyPercentage  ,  and  the difference between them cannot be
              greater than 100. A larger range increases  the  number  of  in-
              stances that can be replaced at the same time.

              If you do not specify this property, the default is 100 percent,
              or the percentage set in the instance maintenance policy for the
              Auto Scaling group, if defined.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To start an instance refresh using command line parameters

       The following start-instance-refresh example starts an instance refresh
       using command line arguments. The optional preferences parameter speci-
       fies  an  InstanceWarmup of 60 seconds and a MinHealthyPercentage of 50
       percent.

          aws autoscaling start-instance-refresh \
              --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
              --preferences '{"InstanceWarmup": 60, "MinHealthyPercentage": 50}'

       Output:

          {
              "InstanceRefreshId": "08b91cf7-8fa6-48af-b6a6-d227f40f1b9b"
          }

       For more information, see Start an instance refresh in the  Amazon  EC2
       Auto Scaling User Guide.

       Example 2: To start an instance refresh using a JSON file

       The following start-instance-refresh example starts an instance refresh
       using a JSON file. You can specify the Auto Scaling  group  and  define
       your  desired configuration and preferences in a JSON file, as shown in
       the following example.

          aws autoscaling start-instance-refresh \
              --cli-input-json file://config.json

       Contents of config.json:

          {
              "AutoScalingGroupName": "my-asg",
              "DesiredConfiguration": {
                  "LaunchTemplate": {
                      "LaunchTemplateId": "lt-068f72b729example",
                      "Version": "$Default"
                  }
              },
              "Preferences": {
                  "InstanceWarmup": 60,
                  "MinHealthyPercentage": 50,
                  "AutoRollback": true,
                  "ScaleInProtectedInstances": Ignore,
                  "StandbyInstances": Terminate
              }
          }

       Output:

          {
              "InstanceRefreshId": "08b91cf7-8fa6-48af-b6a6-d227f40f1b9b"
          }
