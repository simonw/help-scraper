PUT-WARM-POOL()                                                PUT-WARM-POOL()



NAME
       put-warm-pool -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  or updates a warm pool for the specified Auto Scaling group. A
       warm pool is a pool of pre-initialized EC2 instances that  sits  along-
       side  the  Auto Scaling group. Whenever your application needs to scale
       out, the Auto Scaling group can draw on the warm pool to meet  its  new
       desired  capacity. For more information and example configurations, see
       Warm pools for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling in the Amazon EC2  Auto  Scaling
       User Guide .

       This operation must be called from the Region in which the Auto Scaling
       group was created. This operation cannot be called on an  Auto  Scaling
       group  that has a mixed instances policy or a launch template or launch
       configuration that requests Spot Instances.

       You can view the instances in the warm pool using the  DescribeWarmPool
       API  call. If you are no longer using a warm pool, you can delete it by
       calling the  DeleteWarmPool API.

SYNOPSIS
            put-warm-pool
          --auto-scaling-group-name <value>
          [--max-group-prepared-capacity <value>]
          [--min-size <value>]
          [--pool-state <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --max-group-prepared-capacity (integer)
          Specifies the maximum number of instances that are allowed to be  in
          the warm pool or in any state except Terminated for the Auto Scaling
          group. This is an optional property. Specify it only if you  do  not
          want  the  warm pool size to be determined by the difference between
          the group's maximum capacity and its desired capacity.

          WARNING:
              If a value for MaxGroupPreparedCapacity is not specified, Amazon
              EC2  Auto  Scaling launches and maintains the difference between
              the group's maximum capacity and its desired  capacity.  If  you
              specify  a  value for MaxGroupPreparedCapacity , Amazon EC2 Auto
              Scaling uses the difference between the MaxGroupPreparedCapacity
              and the desired capacity instead.

              The  size  of  the  warm pool is dynamic. Only when MaxGroupPre-
              paredCapacity and MinSize are set to the  same  value  does  the
              warm pool have an absolute size.

          If the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group is higher than the
          MaxGroupPreparedCapacity , the capacity of the warm pool is  0,  un-
          less  you  specify  a value for MinSize . To remove a value that you
          previously set, include the property but specify -1 for the value.

       --min-size (integer)
          Specifies the minimum number of instances to maintain  in  the  warm
          pool. This helps you to ensure that there is always a certain number
          of warmed instances available to handle traffic spikes. Defaults  to
          0 if not specified.

       --pool-state (string)
          Sets the instance state to transition to after the lifecycle actions
          are complete. Default is Stopped .

          Possible values:

          o Stopped

          o Running

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a warm pool

       The following example creates a warm pool for the specified Auto  Scal-
       ing group.

          aws autoscaling put-warm-pool \
              --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
              --min-size 2

       This command produces no output. If a warm pool already exists, it will
       be updated.

       For more information, see Warm pools for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling in the
       Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
