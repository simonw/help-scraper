NAME
       describe-warm-pool -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about a warm pool and its instances.

       For more information, see Warm pools for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling in the
       Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-warm-pool
          --auto-scaling-group-name <value>
          [--max-records <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-group-name (string)
          The name of the Auto Scaling group.

       --max-records (integer)
          The maximum number of instances to return with this call. The  maxi-
          mum value is 50 .

       --next-token (string)
          The  token  for  the  next set of instances to return. (You received
          this token from a previous call.)

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              The  maximum  number  of instances that are allowed to be in the
              warm pool or in any state except Terminated for the Auto Scaling
              group.

          MinSize -> (integer)
              The minimum number of instances to maintain in the warm pool.

          PoolState -> (string)
              The  instance state to transition to after the lifecycle actions
              are complete.

                 returned to the warm pool on scale in.

       Instances -> (list)
          The instances that are currently in the warm pool.

                 The last reported health status of  the  instance.  "Healthy"
                 means  that the instance is healthy and should remain in ser-
                 vice. "Unhealthy" means that the instance  is  unhealthy  and
                 that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling should terminate and replace it.

              LaunchConfigurationName -> (string)
                 The launch configuration associated with the instance.

              LaunchTemplate -> (structure)

                 LaunchTemplateId -> (string)
                     The  ID  of  the launch template. To get the template ID,
                     use the Amazon EC2 DescribeLaunchTemplates API operation.
                     New  launch templates can be created using the Amazon EC2
                     CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                     Conditional: You must specify either  a  LaunchTemplateId
                     or a LaunchTemplateName .

                 LaunchTemplateName -> (string)
                     The  name  of  the  launch  template. To get the template
                     name, use the Amazon EC2 DescribeLaunchTemplates API  op-
                     eration.  New  launch  templates can be created using the
                     Amazon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplate API.

                     Conditional: You must specify either  a  LaunchTemplateId
                     or a LaunchTemplateName .

                 Version -> (string)
                     The  version  number,  $Latest , or $Default . To get the

                     DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions  API operation. New launch
                     template versions can be created  using  the  Amazon  EC2
                     CreateLaunchTemplateVersion  API. If the value is $Latest
                     , Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling selects the latest  version  of
                     the  launch  template  when  launching  instances. If the
                     value is $Default , Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling  selects  the
                     default version of the launch template when launching in-
                     stances. The default value is $Default .

                 Indicates whether the instance is protected from  termination
                 by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling when scaling in.
