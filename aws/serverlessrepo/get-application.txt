GET-APPLICATION()                                            GET-APPLICATION()



NAME
       get-application -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the specified application.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-application
          --application-id <value>
          [--semantic-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the application.

       --semantic-version (string)
          The semantic version of the application to get.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     An array containing the list of values  allowed  for  the
                     parameter.

                     (string)

                 ConstraintDescription -> (string)
                     A  string  that explains a constraint when the constraint
                     is violated. For example, without a  constraint  descrip-
                     tion,   a  parameter  that  has  an  allowed  pattern  of
                     [A-Za-z0-9]+ displays the following  error  message  when
                     the user specifies an invalid value:

                     Malformed  input-Parameter MyParameter must match pattern
                     [A-Za-z0-9]+

                     By adding a constraint description, such as "must contain
                     only  uppercase  and  lowercase letters and numbers," you
                     can display the following customized error message:

                     Malformed input-Parameter MyParameter must  contain  only
                     uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers.

                 DefaultValue -> (string)
                     A  value  of the appropriate type for the template to use
                     if no value is specified when a stack is created. If  you
                     define  constraints for the parameter, you must specify a
                     value that adheres to those constraints.

                 Description -> (string)
                     A string of up to 4,000 characters that describes the pa-
                     rameter.

                 MaxLength -> (integer)
                     An  integer  value  that determines the largest number of
                     characters that you want to allow for String types.

                 MaxValue -> (integer)
                     A numeric value that determines the largest numeric value
                     that you want to allow for Number types.

                 MinLength -> (integer)
                     An  integer  value that determines the smallest number of
                     characters that you want to allow for String types.

                 MinValue -> (integer)
                     A numeric value  that  determines  the  smallest  numeric
                     value that you want to allow for Number types.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of the parameter.

                 NoEcho -> (boolean)
                     Whether to mask the parameter value whenever anyone makes
                     a call that describes the stack. If you set the value  to
                     true, the parameter value is masked with asterisks (*).

                 ReferencedByResources -> (list)
                     A list of AWS SAM resources that use this parameter.

                     (string)

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of the parameter.

                     Valid  values:  String | Number | List<Number> | CommaDe-
                     limitedList

                     String: A literal string.

                     For example, users can specify "MyUserName".

                     Number: An integer or float. AWS CloudFormation validates
                     the  parameter  value  as a number. However, when you use
                     the parameter elsewhere in your template (for example, by
                     using  the  Ref  intrinsic function), the parameter value
                     becomes a string.

                     For example, users might specify "8888".

                     List<Number>: An array of integers  or  floats  that  are
                     separated by commas. AWS CloudFormation validates the pa-
                     rameter value as numbers. However, when you use  the  pa-
                     rameter elsewhere in your template (for example, by using
                     the Ref intrinsic function), the parameter value  becomes
                     a list of strings.

                     For  example,  users  might specify "80,20", and then Ref
                     results in ["80","20"].

                     CommaDelimitedList: An array of literal strings that  are
                     separated  by  commas. The total number of strings should
                     be one more than the total number of commas.  Also,  each
                     member string is space-trimmed.

                     For  example,  users  might  specify "test,dev,prod", and
                     then Ref results in ["test","dev","prod"].

          RequiredCapabilities -> (list)
              A list of values that you must specify  before  you  can  deploy
              certain  applications. Some applications might include resources
              that can affect permissions in your AWS account, for example, by
              creating new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For
              those applications, you must explicitly acknowledge their  capa-
              bilities by specifying this parameter.

              The  only valid values are CAPABILITY_IAM, CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM,
              CAPABILITY_RESOURCE_POLICY, and CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND.

              The following resources require you to specify CAPABILITY_IAM or
              CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM:              AWS::IAM::Group             ,
              AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile    ,    AWS::IAM::Policy     ,     and
              AWS::IAM::Role  . If the application contains IAM resources, you
              can specify either CAPABILITY_IAM  or  CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.  If
              the  application  contains  IAM resources with custom names, you
              must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.

              The following resources require you  to  specify  CAPABILITY_RE-
              SOURCE_POLICY:   AWS::Lambda::Permission   ,  AWS::IAM:Policy  ,
              AWS::ApplicationAutoScaling::ScalingPolicy                     ,
              AWS::S3::BucketPolicy     ,    AWS::SQS::QueuePolicy    ,    and
              AWS::SNS::TopicPolicy .

              Applications that contain one or more  nested  applications  re-
              quire you to specify CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND.

              If  your  application  template  contains  any  of the above re-
              sources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated
              with the application before deploying. If you don't specify this
              parameter for an application  that  requires  capabilities,  the
              call will fail.

              (string)
                 Values  that must be specified in order to deploy some appli-
                 cations.

          ResourcesSupported -> (boolean)
              Whether all of the AWS resources contained in  this  application
              are supported in the region in which it is being retrieved.

          SemanticVersion -> (string)
              The semantic version of the application:
                 https://semver.org/

          SourceCodeArchiveUrl -> (string)
              A  link  to  the  S3 object that contains the ZIP archive of the
              source code for this version of your application.

              Maximum size 50 MB

          SourceCodeUrl -> (string)
              A link to a public repository for the source code of your appli-
              cation, for example the URL of a specific GitHub commit.

          TemplateUrl -> (string)
              A link to the packaged AWS SAM template of your application.
