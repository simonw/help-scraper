UPDATE-RESOURCE()                                            UPDATE-RESOURCE()



NAME
       update-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the specified property values in the resource.

       You  specify  your  resource property updates as a list of patch opera-
       tions contained in a JSON patch document that adheres to the ` RFC 6902
       -       JavaScript       Object       Notation       (JSON)       Patch
       https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902`__ standard.

       For details on how Cloud Control API performs  resource  update  opera-
       tions, see Updating a resource in the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control
       API User Guide .

       After you have initiated a resource update request, you can monitor the
       progress  of your request by calling GetResourceRequestStatus using the
       RequestToken of the ProgressEvent returned by UpdateResource .

       For more information about the properties of a specific resource, refer
       to  the  related  topic  for  the resource in the Resource and property
       types reference in the Amazon Web Services CloudFormation Users Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            update-resource
          --type-name <value>
          [--type-version-id <value>]
          [--role-arn <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          --identifier <value>
          --patch-document <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --type-name (string)
          The name of the resource type.

       --type-version-id (string)
          For private resource types, the type version to use in this resource
          operation.  If you do not specify a resource version, CloudFormation
          uses the default version.

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management
          (IAM) for Cloud Control API to use when performing this resource op-
          eration. The role specified must have the permissions  required  for
          this operation. The necessary permissions for each event handler are
          defined in the `` handlers `` section of the resource  type  defini-
          tion schema .

          If  you  do  not  specify a role, Cloud Control API uses a temporary
          session created using your Amazon Web Services user credentials.

          For more information, see Specifying credentials in the  Amazon  Web
          Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique  identifier  to ensure the idempotency of the resource re-
          quest. As a best practice, specify this token to ensure idempotency,
          so that Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API can accurately distin-
          guish between request retries and new resource requests.  You  might
          retry  a  resource  request  to  ensure that it was successfully re-
          ceived.

          A client token is valid for 36 hours once used. After  that,  a  re-
          source  request  with  the same client token is treated as a new re-
          quest.

          If you do not specify a client token, one is generated for inclusion
          in the request.

          For  more  information, see Ensuring resource operation requests are
          unique in the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

       --identifier (string)
          The identifier for the resource.

          You can specify the primary identifier, or any secondary  identifier
          defined  for  the resource type in its resource schema. You can only
          specify one identifier. Primary identifiers can be  specified  as  a
          string or JSON; secondary identifiers must be specified as JSON.

          For compound primary identifiers (that is, one that consists of mul-
          tiple resource properties strung together), to specify  the  primary
          identifier  as  a string, list the property values in the order they
          are specified in the primary identifier definition, separated by | .

          For more information, see Identifying resources in  the  Amazon  Web
          Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

       --patch-document (string)
          A JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) document listing the patch oper-
          ations that represent the updates to apply to the  current  resource
          properties.  For  details,  see  Composing the patch document in the
          Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update the properties of an existing resource

       The following update-resource example updates the retention  policy  of
       an AWS::Logs::LogGroup resource named ExampleLogGroup to 90 days.

          aws cloudcontrol update-resource \
              --type-name AWS::Logs::LogGroup \
              --identifier ExampleLogGroup \
              --patch-document "[{\"op\":\"replace\",\"path\":\"/RetentionInDays\",\"value\":90}]"

       Output:

          {
              "ProgressEvent": {
                  "EventTime": "2021-08-09T18:17:15.219Z",
                  "TypeName": "AWS::Logs::LogGroup",
                  "OperationStatus": "IN_PROGRESS",
                  "Operation": "UPDATE",
                  "Identifier": "ExampleLogGroup",
                  "RequestToken": "5f40c577-3534-4b20-9599-0b0123456789"
              }
          }
