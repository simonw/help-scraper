NAME
       list-resource-requests -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns existing resource operation requests. This includes requests of
       all status types. For more information, see Listing active resource op-
       eration  requests  in  the  Amazon  Web Services Cloud Control API User
       Guide .

       NOTE:
          Resource operation requests expire after seven days.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-resource-requests
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--resource-request-status-filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to be returned with a single call.  If
          the  number  of available results exceeds this maximum, the response
          includes a NextToken value that you can assign to the NextToken  re-
          quest parameter to get the next set of results.

          The default is 20 .

       --next-token (string)
          If the previous paginated request didn't return all of the remaining
          results, the response object's NextToken parameter value is set to a
          token.  To  retrieve the next set of results, call this action again
          and assign that token to the request object's  NextToken  parameter.
          If  there  are  no remaining results, the previous response object's
          NextToken parameter is set to null .

       --resource-request-status-filter (structure)
          The filter criteria to apply to the requests returned.

          Operations -> (list)
              The operation types to include in the filter.

              (string)

          OperationStatuses -> (list)
              The operation statuses to include in the filter.

              o PENDING : The operation has been requested, but not yet initi-
                ated.

              o IN_PROGRESS : The operation is currently in progress.

              o SUCCESS : The operation has successfully completed.

              o FAILED : The operation has failed.

              o CANCEL_IN_PROGRESS : The operation is currently in the process
                of being canceled.

              o CANCEL_COMPLETE : The operation has been canceled.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Operations=string,string,OperationStatuses=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Operations": ["CREATE"|"DELETE"|"UPDATE", ...],
            "OperationStatuses": ["PENDING"|"IN_PROGRESS"|"SUCCESS"|"FAILED"|"CANCEL_IN_PROGRESS"|"CANCEL_COMPLETE", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the active resource operation requests

       The  following  list-resource-requests  example  lists the resource re-
       quests for CREATE and UPDATE operations that have failed  in  your  AWS
       account.

          aws cloudcontrol list-resource-requests \
              --resource-request-status-filter Operations=CREATE,OperationStatuses=FAILED

       Output:

          {
              "ResourceRequestStatusSummaries": [
                  {
                      "TypeName": "AWS::Kinesis::Stream",
                      "Identifier": "Demo",
                      "RequestToken": "e1a6b86e-46bd-41ac-bfba-633abcdfdbd7",
                      "Operation": "CREATE",
                      "OperationStatus": "FAILED",
                      "EventTime": 1632950268.481,
                      "StatusMessage": "Resource of type 'AWS::Kinesis::Stream' with identifier 'Demo' already exists.",
                      "ErrorCode": "AlreadyExists"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       ResourceRequestStatusSummaries -> (list)
          The requests that match the specified filter criteria.

          (structure)
              Represents the current status of a resource  operation  request.
              For  more  information, see Managing resource operation requests

                 NOTE:
                     In some cases, the resource identifier may  be  available
                     before  the  resource  operation  has reached a status of

                 The unique token representing  this  resource  operation  re-
                 quest.

                 Use  the RequestToken with GetResourceRequestStatus to return
                 the current status of a resource operation request.

                   error code and status message for more information.

                 o CANCEL_IN_PROGRESS  :  The  resource  operation  is  in the
                   process of being canceled.

                 o CANCEL_COMPLETE : The resource operation has been canceled.

              EventTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the resource operation request was initiated.

                 A JSON string containing the resource  model,  consisting  of
                 each resource property and its current value.

                 When to next request the status of  this  resource  operation
                 request.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the request doesn't return all of the remaining results, NextTo-
          ken is set to a token. To retrieve the next  set  of  results,  call
          ListResources  again  and  assign that token to the request object's
          NextToken parameter. If the request returns all  results,  NextToken
          is set to null.
