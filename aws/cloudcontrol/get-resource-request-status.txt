GET-RESOURCE-REQUEST-STATUS()                    GET-RESOURCE-REQUEST-STATUS()



NAME
       get-resource-request-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  current  status of a resource operation request. For more
       information, see Tracking the progress of resource  operation  requests
       in the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-resource-request-status
          --request-token <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --request-token (string)
          A  unique token used to track the progress of the resource operation
          request.

          Request tokens are included in the ProgressEvent type returned by  a
          resource operation request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the status information of a resource request

       The following get-resource-request-status example returns status infor-
       mation about the specified resource request.

          aws cloudcontrol get-resource-request-status \
              --request-token "e1a6b86e-46bd-41ac-bfba-001234567890"

       Output:

          {
              "ProgressEvent": {
                  "TypeName": "AWS::Kinesis::Stream",
                  "Identifier": "Demo",
                  "RequestToken": "e1a6b86e-46bd-41ac-bfba-001234567890",
                  "Operation": "CREATE",
                  "OperationStatus": "FAILED",
                  "EventTime": 1632950268.481,
                  "StatusMessage": "Resource of type 'AWS::Kinesis::Stream' with identifier 'Demo' already exists.",
                  "ErrorCode": "AlreadyExists"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       ProgressEvent -> (structure)
          Represents the current status of the resource operation request.

          TypeName -> (string)
              The name of the resource type used in the operation.

          RequestToken -> (string)
              The unique token representing this resource operation request.

              Use the RequestToken with GetResourceRequestStatus to return the
              current status of a resource operation request.

          Operation -> (string)
              The resource operation type.

          OperationStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the resource operation request.

              o PENDING : The resource operation has not yet started.

              o IN_PROGRESS : The resource operation is currently in progress.

              o SUCCESS : The resource operation has successfully completed.

              o FAILED : The resource operation has failed. Refer to the error
                code and status message for more information.

              o CANCEL_IN_PROGRESS : The resource operation is in the  process
                of being canceled.

              o CANCEL_COMPLETE : The resource operation has been canceled.

          EventTime -> (timestamp)
              When the resource operation request was initiated.

          ResourceModel -> (string)
              A  JSON string containing the resource model, consisting of each
              resource property and its current value.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              Any message explaining the current status.

          ErrorCode -> (string)
              For requests with a status of  FAILED  ,  the  associated  error
              code.

              For  error  code  definitions,  see  Handler  error codes in the

              Development .

          RetryAfter -> (timestamp)
              When  to  next request the status of this resource operation re-
              quest.
