DELETE-RESOURCE()                                            DELETE-RESOURCE()



NAME
       delete-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the specified resource. For details, see Deleting a resource in
       the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

       After you have initiated a resource deletion request, you  can  monitor
       the  progress of your request by calling GetResourceRequestStatus using
       the RequestToken of the ProgressEvent returned by DeleteResource .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-resource
          --type-name <value>
          [--type-version-id <value>]
          [--role-arn <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          --identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --type-name (string)
          The name of the resource type.

       --type-version-id (string)
          For private resource types, the type version to use in this resource
          operation.  If you do not specify a resource version, CloudFormation
          uses the default version.

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management
          (IAM)  role  for  Cloud  Control API to use when performing this re-
          source operation. The role specified must have the  permissions  re-
          quired  for this operation. The necessary permissions for each event
          handler are defined in the `` handlers `` section  of  the  resource
          type definition schema .

          If  you  do  not  specify a role, Cloud Control API uses a temporary
          session created using your Amazon Web Services user credentials.

          For more information, see Specifying credentials in the  Amazon  Web
          Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique  identifier  to ensure the idempotency of the resource re-
          quest. As a best practice, specify this token to ensure idempotency,
          so that Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API can accurately distin-
          guish between request retries and new resource requests.  You  might
          retry  a  resource  request  to  ensure that it was successfully re-
          ceived.

          A client token is valid for 36 hours once used. After  that,  a  re-
          source  request  with  the same client token is treated as a new re-
          quest.

          If you do not specify a client token, one is generated for inclusion
          in the request.

          For  more  information, see Ensuring resource operation requests are
          unique in the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

       --identifier (string)
          The identifier for the resource.

          You can specify the primary identifier, or any secondary  identifier
          defined  for  the resource type in its resource schema. You can only
          specify one identifier. Primary identifiers can be  specified  as  a
          string or JSON; secondary identifiers must be specified as JSON.

          For compound primary identifiers (that is, one that consists of mul-
          tiple resource properties strung together), to specify  the  primary
          identifier  as  a string, list the property values in the order they
          are specified in the primary identifier definition, separated by | .

          For more information, see Identifying resources in  the  Amazon  Web
          Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a resource

       The following delete-resource example  deletes  a  AWS::Kinesis::Stream
       resource with the identifier ResourceExample from your AWS account.

          aws cloudcontrol delete-resource \
              --type-name AWS::Kinesis::Stream \
              --identifier ResourceExample

       Output:

          {
              "ProgressEvent": {
                  "TypeName": "AWS::Kinesis::Stream",
                  "Identifier": "ResourceExample",
                  "RequestToken": "e48f26ff-d0f9-4ab8-a878-120db1edf111",
                  "Operation": "DELETE",
                  "OperationStatus": "IN_PROGRESS",
                  "EventTime": 1632950300.14
              }
          }

       User Guide.

OUTPUT
       ProgressEvent -> (structure)
          Represents the current status of the resource deletion request.

          After you have initiated a resource deletion request, you can  moni-
          tor the progress of your request by calling GetResourceRequestStatus
          using the RequestToken of the ProgressEvent  returned  by  DeleteRe-
          source .

          TypeName -> (string)
              The name of the resource type used in the operation.

          Identifier -> (string)
              The primary identifier for the resource.

              NOTE:
                 In  some  cases, the resource identifier may be available be-
                 fore the resource operation has reached a status of SUCCESS .

          RequestToken -> (string)
              The unique token representing this resource operation request.

              Use the RequestToken with GetResourceRequestStatus to return the
              current status of a resource operation request.

          Operation -> (string)
              The resource operation type.

          OperationStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the resource operation request.

              o PENDING : The resource operation hasn't yet started.

              o IN_PROGRESS : The resource operation is currently in progress.

              o SUCCESS : The resource operation has successfully completed.

              o FAILED : The resource operation has failed. Refer to the error
                code and status message for more information.

              o CANCEL_IN_PROGRESS : The resource operation is in the  process
                of being canceled.

              o CANCEL_COMPLETE : The resource operation has been canceled.

          EventTime -> (timestamp)
              When the resource operation request was initiated.

          ResourceModel -> (string)
              A  JSON string containing the resource model, consisting of each
              resource property and its current value.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              Any message explaining the current status.

          ErrorCode -> (string)
              For requests with a status of  FAILED  ,  the  associated  error
              code.

              For  error  code  definitions,  see  Handler  error codes in the
              CloudFormation Command Line Interface User Guide  for  Extension
              Development .

          RetryAfter -> (timestamp)
              When  to  next request the status of this resource operation re-
              quest.
