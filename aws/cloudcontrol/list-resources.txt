NAME
       list-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  the specified resources. For more informa-
       tion, see Discovering resources in the Amazon Web Services  Cloud  Con-
       trol API User Guide .

       You  can use this action to return information about existing resources
       in your account and Amazon Web Services Region, whether those resources
       were provisioned using Cloud Control API.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-resources
          --type-name <value>
          [--type-version-id <value>]
          [--role-arn <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--resource-model <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --type-name (string)
          The name of the resource type.

       --type-version-id (string)
          For private resource types, the type version to use in this resource
          operation. If you do not specify a resource version,  CloudFormation
          uses the default version.

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management
          (IAM) role for Cloud Control API to use  when  performing  this  re-
          source  operation.  The role specified must have the permissions re-
          quired for this operation. The necessary permissions for each  event
          handler  are  defined  in the `` handlers `` section of the resource
          type definition schema .

          If you do not specify a role, Cloud Control  API  uses  a  temporary
          session created using your Amazon Web Services user credentials.

          For  more  information, see Specifying credentials in the Amazon Web
          Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

       --next-token (string)
          If the previous paginated request didn't return all of the remaining
          results, the response object's NextToken parameter value is set to a
          token. To retrieve the next set of results, call this  action  again
          and  assign  that token to the request object's NextToken parameter.
          If there are no remaining results, the  previous  response  object's
          NextToken parameter is set to null .

       --max-results (integer)
          Reserved.

       --resource-model (string)
          The resource model to use to select the resources to return.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the resources of a given type

       The following list-resources example lists the AWS::Kinesis::Stream re-
       sources provisioned in your AWS account.

          aws cloudcontrol list-resources \
              --type-name AWS::Kinesis::Stream

       Output:

          {
              "TypeName": "AWS::Kinesis::Stream",
              "ResourceDescriptions": [
                  {
                      "Identifier": "MyKinesisStream",
                      "Properties": "{\"Name\":\"MyKinesisStream\"}"
                  },
                  {
                      "Identifier": "AnotherStream",
                      "Properties": "{\"Name\":\"AnotherStream\"}"
                  }
              ]
          }

       API User Guide.

OUTPUT
       TypeName -> (string)
          The name of the resource type.

       ResourceDescriptions -> (list)
          Information about the specified resources, including primary identi-
          fier and resource model.

          (structure)
              Represents information about a provisioned resource.

              Identifier -> (string)
                 The primary identifier for the resource.

                 For more information, see Identifying resources in the Amazon
                 Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

              Properties -> (string)
                 A list of the resource properties and their current values.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the request doesn't return all of the remaining results,  NextTo-
          ken  is  set  to  a token. To retrieve the next set of results, call
          ListResources again and assign that token to  the  request  object's
          NextToken  parameter.  If the request returns all results, NextToken
          is set to null.
