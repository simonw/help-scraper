CREATE-RESOURCE()                                            CREATE-RESOURCE()



NAME
       create-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  the  specified  resource. For more information, see Creating a
       resource in the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

       After you have initiated a resource creation request, you  can  monitor
       the  progress of your request by calling GetResourceRequestStatus using
       the RequestToken of the ProgressEvent type returned by CreateResource .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-resource
          --type-name <value>
          [--type-version-id <value>]
          [--role-arn <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          --desired-state <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --type-name (string)
          The name of the resource type.

       --type-version-id (string)
          For private resource types, the type version to use in this resource
          operation.  If you do not specify a resource version, CloudFormation
          uses the default version.

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management
          (IAM) for Cloud Control API to use when performing this resource op-
          eration. The role specified must have the permissions  required  for
          this operation. The necessary permissions for each event handler are
          defined in the `` handlers `` section of the resource  type  defini-
          tion schema .

          If  you  do  not  specify a role, Cloud Control API uses a temporary
          session created using your Amazon Web Services user credentials.

          For more information, see Specifying credentials in the  Amazon  Web
          Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique  identifier  to ensure the idempotency of the resource re-
          quest. As a best practice, specify this token to ensure idempotency,
          so that Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API can accurately distin-
          guish between request retries and new resource requests.  You  might
          retry  a  resource  request  to  ensure that it was successfully re-
          ceived.

          A client token is valid for 36 hours once used. After  that,  a  re-
          source  request  with  the same client token is treated as a new re-
          quest.

          If you do not specify a client token, one is generated for inclusion
          in the request.

          For  more  information, see Ensuring resource operation requests are
          unique in the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

       --desired-state (string)
          Structured data format representing the desired  state  of  the  re-
          source,  consisting  of that resource's properties and their desired
          values.

          NOTE:
              Cloud Control API currently supports JSON as a  structured  data
              format.

          Specify the desired state as one of the following:

          o A JSON blob

          o A local path containing the desired state in JSON data format

          For  more  information,  see  Composing the desired state of the re-
          source in the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide .

          For more information about the properties of  a  specific  resource,
          refer  to  the  related  topic  for the resource in the Resource and
          property types reference in the Amazon Web  Services  CloudFormation
          Users Guide .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a resource

       The  following  create-resource example creates an AWS::Kinesis::Stream
       resource, named ResourceExample, with a retention period of  168  hours
       and a shard count of three.

          aws cloudcontrol create-resource \
              --type-name AWS::Kinesis::Stream \
              --desired-state "{\"Name\": \"ResourceExample\",\"RetentionPeriodHours\":168, \"ShardCount\":3}"

       Output:

          {
              "ProgressEvent": {
                  "EventTime": 1632506656.706,
                  "TypeName": "AWS::Kinesis::Stream",
                  "OperationStatus": "IN_PROGRESS",
                  "Operation": "CREATE",
                  "Identifier": "ResourceExample",
                  "RequestToken": "20999d87-e304-4725-ad84-832dcbfd7fc5"
              }
          }

       User Guide.

OUTPUT
       ProgressEvent -> (structure)
          Represents the current status of the resource creation request.

          After you have initiated a resource creation request, you can  moni-
          tor the progress of your request by calling GetResourceRequestStatus
          using the RequestToken of the ProgressEvent  returned  by  CreateRe-
          source .

          TypeName -> (string)
              The name of the resource type used in the operation.

          Identifier -> (string)
              The primary identifier for the resource.

              NOTE:
                 In  some  cases, the resource identifier may be available be-
                 fore the resource operation has reached a status of SUCCESS .

          RequestToken -> (string)
              The unique token representing this resource operation request.

              Use the RequestToken with GetResourceRequestStatus to return the
              current status of a resource operation request.

          Operation -> (string)
              The resource operation type.

          OperationStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the resource operation request.

              o PENDING : The resource operation has not yet started.

              o IN_PROGRESS : The resource operation is currently in progress.

              o SUCCESS : The resource operation has successfully completed.

              o FAILED : The resource operation has failed. Refer to the error
                code and status message for more information.

              o CANCEL_IN_PROGRESS : The resource operation is in the  process
                of being canceled.

              o CANCEL_COMPLETE : The resource operation has been canceled.

          EventTime -> (timestamp)
              When the resource operation request was initiated.

          ResourceModel -> (string)
              A  JSON string containing the resource model, consisting of each
              resource property and its current value.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              Any message explaining the current status.

          ErrorCode -> (string)
              For requests with a status of  FAILED  ,  the  associated  error
              code.

              For  error  code  definitions,  see  Handler  error codes in the
              CloudFormation Command Line Interface User Guide  for  Extension
              Development .

          RetryAfter -> (timestamp)
              When  to  next request the status of this resource operation re-
              quest.
