OPTIONS
       --definition (tagged union structure)
          Template configuration to define the information  included  in  cer-
          tificates. Define certificate validity and renewal periods, certifi-
          cate request handling and enrollment options, key usage  extensions,
          application policies, and cryptography settings.

          NOTE:
              This  is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following top
              level keys can be set: TemplateV2, TemplateV3, TemplateV4.

          TemplateV2 -> (structure)
              Template configuration to define  the  information  included  in
              certificates.  Define  certificate validity and renewal periods,
              certificate request handling and enrollment options,  key  usage
              extensions, application policies, and cryptography settings.

              CertificateValidity -> (structure)
                 Certificate validity describes the validity and renewal peri-
                 ods of a certificate.

                 RenewalPeriod -> (structure)
                     Renewal period is the period of time  before  certificate
                     expiration when a new certificate will be requested.

                     Period -> (long)
                        The numeric value for the validity period.

                     PeriodType -> (string)
                        The  unit  of time. You can select hours, days, weeks,
                        months, and years.

                 ValidityPeriod -> (structure)
                     Information describing the end of the validity period  of
                     the  certificate.  This parameter sets the Not After date
                     for the certificate. Certificate validity is  the  period
                     of time during which a certificate is valid. Validity can
                     be expressed as an explicit date and time when  the  cer-
                     tificate  expires,  or  as a span of time after issuance,
                     stated in days, months, or years. For  more  information,
                     see  Validity  in RFC 5280. This value is unaffected when
                     ValidityNotBefore is also specified. For example, if  Va-
                     lidity  is  set to 20 days in the future, the certificate
                     will expire 20 days from issuance time regardless of  the
                     ValidityNotBefore value.

                     Period -> (long)
                        The numeric value for the validity period.

                     PeriodType -> (string)

                     the  certificate.  This parameter sets the Not After date
                     for the certificate. Certificate validity is  the  period
                     of time during which a certificate is valid. Validity can
                     be expressed as an explicit date and time when  the  cer-
                     tificate  expires,  or  as a span of time after issuance,
                     stated in days, months, or years. For  more  information,
                     see  Validity  in RFC 5280. This value is unaffected when
                     ValidityNotBefore is also specified. For example, if  Va-
                     lidity  is  set to 20 days in the future, the certificate
                     will expire 20 days from issuance time regardless of  the
                     ValidityNotBefore value.

                 KeyUsageProperty -> (tagged union structure)
                     The key usage property defines the purpose of the private
                     key contained in the certificate. You  can  specify  spe-
                     cific purposes using property flags or all by using prop-
                     erty type ALL.

                     NOTE:
                        This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the fol-
                        lowing top level keys can be set: PropertyFlags, Prop-

                        KeyAgreement -> (boolean)
                            Allows key exchange without encryption.

                        Sign -> (boolean)
                            Allow key use for digital signature.

                     PropertyType -> (string)
                        You can specify all key  usages  using  property  type
                        ALL.  You  can use property type or property flags but
                        not both.

                 MinimalKeyLength -> (integer)
                     Set the minimum key length of the private key.

              PrivateKeyFlags -> (structure)
                 Private key flags for v4 templates specify the client compat-
                 ibility, if the private key can be exported, if user input is
                 required when using a private key, if an alternate  signature
                 algorithm should be used, and if certificates are renewed us-
                 ing the same private key.

                 ClientVersion -> (string)
                     Defines the minimum client compatibility.

                 ExportableKey -> (boolean)
                     Allows the private key to be exported.

                 RequireAlternateSignatureAlgorithm -> (boolean)
                     Requires the PKCS #1 v2.1 signature format  for  certifi-
                     cates.  You  should verify that your CA, objects, and ap-
                     plications can accept this signature format.

                 RequireSameKeyRenewal -> (boolean)

                     name.

                 SanRequireSpn -> (boolean)
                     Include  the  service principal name (SPN) in the subject
                     alternate name.

                 SanRequireUpn -> (boolean)

       --reenroll-all-certificate-holders     |     --no-reenroll-all-certifi-
       cate-holders (boolean)
          This  setting allows the major version of a template to be increased
          automatically. All members of Active Directory groups that  are  al-
          lowed  to  enroll with a template will receive a new certificate is-
          sued using that template.

       --template-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that was  returned  when  you  called
          CreateTemplate .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)
