NAME
       get-pipeline -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the metadata, structure, stages, and actions of a pipeline. Can
       be used to return the entire structure of a pipeline  in  JSON  format,
       which  can  then  be modified and used to update the pipeline structure
       with  UpdatePipeline .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-pipeline
          --name <value>
          [--pipeline-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the pipeline for which  you  want  to  get  information.
          Pipeline names must be unique under an AWS user account.

       --pipeline-version (integer)
          The version number of the pipeline. If you do not specify a version,
          defaults to the current version.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To view the structure of a pipeline

       This example returns the structure of a pipeline named MyFirstPipeline.

       Command:

          aws codepipeline get-pipeline --name MyFirstPipeline

OUTPUT
       pipeline -> (structure)
          Represents the structure of actions and stages to  be  performed  in
          the pipeline.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the pipeline.

          roleArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) for AWS CodePipeline to use to
              either perform actions with no actionRoleArn , or to use to  as-
              sume roles for actions with an actionRoleArn .

          artifactStore -> (structure)
              Represents  information  about the S3 bucket where artifacts are
              stored for the pipeline.

              NOTE:
                 You must include either artifactStore  or  artifactStores  in
                 your  pipeline,  but  you  cannot  use  both. If you create a
                 cross-region action in your pipeline, you must use  artifact-
                 Stores .

              type -> (string)
                 The type of the artifact store, such as S3.

              location -> (string)
                 The  S3 bucket used for storing the artifacts for a pipeline.
                 You can specify the name of an S3 bucket but not a folder  in
                 the  bucket.  A  folder  to contain the pipeline artifacts is
                 created for you based on the name of the  pipeline.  You  can
                 use  any  S3 bucket in the same AWS Region as the pipeline to
                 store your pipeline artifacts.

              encryptionKey -> (structure)
                 The encryption key used to encrypt the data in  the  artifact
                 store,  such  as an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key.
                 If this is undefined, the default key for Amazon S3 is used.

                 id -> (string)
                     The ID used to identify the key. For an AWS KMS key,  you
                     can use the key ID, the key ARN, or the alias ARN.

                     NOTE:
                        Aliases  are  recognized only in the account that cre-
                        ated the customer master key (CMK). For  cross-account
                        actions,  you  can  only  use the key ID or key ARN to
                        identify the key.

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of encryption key, such as an AWS Key Management
                     Service  (AWS KMS) key. When creating or updating a pipe-
                     line, the value must be set to 'KMS'.

          artifactStores -> (map)
              A mapping of artifactStore objects and their  corresponding  AWS
              Regions. There must be an artifact store for the pipeline Region
              and for each cross-region action in the pipeline.

              NOTE:
                 You must include either artifactStore  or  artifactStores  in
                 your  pipeline,  but  you  cannot  use  both. If you create a
                 cross-region action in your pipeline, you must use  artifact-
                 Stores .

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 The S3 bucket where artifacts for the pipeline are stored.

                 NOTE:
                     You  must  include either artifactStore or artifactStores
                     in your pipeline, but you cannot use both. If you  create
                     a  cross-region action in your pipeline, you must use ar-
                     tifactStores .

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of the artifact store, such as S3.

                 location -> (string)
                     The S3 bucket used for storing the artifacts for a  pipe-
                     line.  You can specify the name of an S3 bucket but not a
                     folder in the bucket. A folder to  contain  the  pipeline
                     artifacts  is  created  for  you based on the name of the
                     pipeline. You can use any S3 bucket in the same  AWS  Re-
                     gion as the pipeline to store your pipeline artifacts.

                 encryptionKey -> (structure)
                     The  encryption key used to encrypt the data in the arti-
                     fact store, such as an AWS Key  Management  Service  (AWS
                     KMS)  key. If this is undefined, the default key for Ama-
                     zon S3 is used.

                     id -> (string)
                        The ID used to identify the key. For an AWS  KMS  key,
                        you can use the key ID, the key ARN, or the alias ARN.

                        NOTE:
                            Aliases  are  recognized  only in the account that
                            created  the  customer  master  key   (CMK).   For
                            cross-account actions, you can only use the key ID
                            or key ARN to identify the key.

                     type -> (string)
                        The type of encryption key, such as an AWS Key Manage-
                        ment  Service (AWS KMS) key. When creating or updating
                        a pipeline, the value must be set to 'KMS'.

          stages -> (list)
              The stage in which to perform the action.

              (structure)
                 Represents information about a stage and its definition.

                        actionTypeId -> (structure)
                            Specifies the action type and the provider of  the
                            action.

                            category -> (string)
                               A  category  defines what kind of action can be
                               taken in the stage, and constrains the provider
                               type  for the action. Valid categories are lim-
                               ited to one of the following values.

                               o Source

                               o Build

                               o Test

                               o Deploy

                               The creator of the action being  called.  There
                               are  three  valid values for the Owner field in
                               the action category section within  your  pipe-
                               line structure: AWS , ThirdParty , and Custom .

                               action  category. For example, an action in the
                               Deploy category type might have a  provider  of
                               AWS  CodeDeploy,  which  would  be specified as

                            The order in which actions are run.

                        configuration -> (map)
                            The  action's  configuration.  These are key-value
                            pairs that specify input values for an action. For

                            The name or ID of the result of the action  decla-
                            ration, such as a test or build artifact.

                            (structure)
                               Represents  information  about the output of an
                               action.

                               name -> (string)
                                   The name of the output of an artifact, such
                                   as "My App".

                                   The  input  artifact  of an action must ex-
                                   actly match the output artifact declared in
                                   a  preceding action, but the input artifact
                                   does not have to  be  the  next  action  in
                                   strict  sequence  from the action that pro-
                                   vided the output artifact. Actions in  par-
                                   allel  can  declare  different output arti-
                                   facts, which are in turn consumed  by  dif-
                                   ferent following actions.

                                   Output artifact names must be unique within
                                   a pipeline.

                        inputArtifacts -> (list)

                               Represents  information about an artifact to be
                               worked on, such as a test or build artifact.

                               name -> (string)
                                   The name of the artifact to  be  worked  on
                                   (for example, "My App").

                                   The  input  artifact  of an action must ex-
                                   actly match the output artifact declared in
                                   a  preceding action, but the input artifact
                                   does not have to  be  the  next  action  in
                                   strict  sequence  from the action that pro-
                                   vided the output artifact. Actions in  par-
                                   allel  can  declare  different output arti-
                                   facts, which are in turn consumed  by  dif-

                            declared  action.  This  is  assumed  through  the
                            roleArn for the pipeline.

                        region -> (string)

                            fall under this namespace.

          version -> (integer)
              The version number of the pipeline. A new pipeline always has  a
              version  number of 1. This number is incremented when a pipeline
              is updated.

       metadata -> (structure)
          Represents the pipeline metadata information returned as part of the
          output of a GetPipeline action.

          pipelineArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the pipeline.

          created -> (timestamp)
              The date and time the pipeline was created, in timestamp format.

          updated -> (timestamp)
              The  date  and  time the pipeline was last updated, in timestamp
              format.
