OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The ID of the job that successfully completed. This is the  same  ID
          returned from PollForThirdPartyJobs .

       --client-token (string)
          The clientToken portion of the clientId and clientToken pair used to
          verify that the calling entity is allowed access to the job and  its
          details.

       --current-revision (structure)
          Represents information about a current revision.

          revision -> (string)
              The revision ID of the current version of an artifact.

          changeIdentifier -> (string)
              The change identifier for the current revision.

          created -> (timestamp)
              The  date and time when the most recent revision of the artifact
              was created, in timestamp format.

          revisionSummary -> (string)
              The summary of the most recent revision of the artifact.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          revision=string,changeIdentifier=string,created=timestamp,revisionSummary=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "revision": "string",
            "changeIdentifier": "string",
            "created": timestamp,
            "revisionSummary": "string"
          }

       --continuation-token (string)
          A token generated by a job worker, such as an AWS CodeDeploy deploy-
          ment ID, that a successful job provides to identify a partner action
          in progress. Future jobs use this token to identify the running  in-
          stance  of  the  action. It can be reused to return more information
          about the progress of the partner action. When the  action  is  com-
          plete, no continuation token should be supplied.

       --execution-details (structure)
          The details of the actions taken and results produced on an artifact
          as it passes through stages in the pipeline.

          summary -> (string)
              The summary of the current status of the actions.

          externalExecutionId -> (string)
              The system-generated unique ID of this action used  to  identify
              this job worker in any external systems, such as AWS CodeDeploy.

          percentComplete -> (integer)
              The percentage of work completed on the action, represented on a
              scale of 0 to 100 percent.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          summary=string,externalExecutionId=string,percentComplete=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "summary": "string",
            "externalExecutionId": "string",
            "percentComplete": integer
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
