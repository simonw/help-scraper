GET-THIRD-PARTY-JOB-DETAILS()                    GET-THIRD-PARTY-JOB-DETAILS()



NAME
       get-third-party-job-details -

DESCRIPTION
       Requests  the details of a job for a third party action. Used for part-
       ner actions only.

       WARNING:
          When this API is called, AWS CodePipeline returns temporary  creden-
          tials for the S3 bucket used to store artifacts for the pipeline, if
          the action requires access to that S3 bucket for input or output ar-
          tifacts. This API also returns any secret values defined for the ac-
          tion.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-third-party-job-details
          --job-id <value>
          --client-token <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The unique system-generated ID used for identifying the job.

       --client-token (string)
          The clientToken portion of the clientId and clientToken pair used to
          verify  that the calling entity is allowed access to the job and its
          details.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       jobDetails -> (structure)
          The  details  of the job, including any protected values defined for
          the job.

          id -> (string)
              The identifier used to identify the job  details  in  AWS  Code-
              Pipeline.

          data -> (structure)
              The data to be returned by the third party job worker.

              actionTypeId -> (structure)
                 Represents information about an action type.

                 category -> (string)
                     A  category  defines  what kind of action can be taken in
                     the stage, and constrains the provider type for  the  ac-
                     tion.  Valid categories are limited to one of the follow-
                     ing values.

                     o Source

                     o Build

                     o Test

                     o Deploy

                     o Invoke

                     o Approval

                 owner -> (string)
                     The creator of the action being called. There  are  three
                     valid  values  for the Owner field in the action category
                     section within your pipeline structure: AWS ,  ThirdParty
                     ,  and  Custom  .  For more information, see Valid Action

                     The provider of the service being called by  the  action.
                     Valid  providers  are  determined by the action category.
                     For example, an action in the Deploy category type  might
                     have  a provider of AWS CodeDeploy, which would be speci-
                     fied as CodeDeploy. For more information, see  Valid  Ac-
                     tion Types and Providers in CodePipeline .

                 The  input artifact name must match the name of an output ar-
                 tifact generated by an action in an earlier action  or  stage

                 tials are temporary credentials that are issued by AWS Secure
                 Token Service (STS). They can be used  to  access  input  and

                 The  encryption  key  used to encrypt and decrypt data in the
                 artifact store for the pipeline, such as an AWS  Key  Manage-
                 ment Service (AWS KMS) key. This is optional and might not be
                 present.

                 id -> (string)
                     The ID used to identify the key. For an AWS KMS key,  you
                     can use the key ID, the key ARN, or the alias ARN.

                     NOTE:
                        Aliases  are  recognized only in the account that cre-
                        ated the customer master key (CMK). For  cross-account
                        actions,  you  can  only  use the key ID or key ARN to
                        identify the key.

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of encryption key, such as an AWS Key Management
                     Service  (AWS KMS) key. When creating or updating a pipe-
                     line, the value must be set to 'KMS'.

          nonce -> (string)
              A system-generated random number that AWS CodePipeline  uses  to
              ensure  that  the job is being worked on by only one job worker.
              Use this number in an  AcknowledgeThirdPartyJob request.
