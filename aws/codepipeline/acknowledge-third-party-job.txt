       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            acknowledge-third-party-job
          --job-id <value>
          --nonce <value>
          --client-token <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The unique system-generated ID of the job.

       --nonce (string)
          A system-generated random number that AWS CodePipeline uses  to  en-
          sure  that  the  job  is being worked on by only one job worker. Get
          this number from the response to a  GetThirdPartyJobDetails request.

       --client-token (string)
          The clientToken portion of the clientId and clientToken pair used to
          verify  that the calling entity is allowed access to the job and its
          details.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       status -> (string)
          The status information for the third party job, if any.
