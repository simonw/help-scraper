          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pipeline-name (string)
          The name of the pipeline that contains the action.

       --stage-name (string)
          The name of the stage that contains the action.

       --action-name (string)
          The name of the action for which approval is requested.

       --result (structure)
          Represents information about the result of the approval request.

          summary -> (string)
              The summary of the current status of the approval request.

          status -> (string)
              The response submitted by a reviewer assigned to an approval ac-
              tion request.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          summary=string,status=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "summary": "string",
            "status": "Approved"|"Rejected"
          }

       --token (string)
          The  system-generated  token  used to identify a unique approval re-
          quest. The token for each open approval request can be obtained  us-
          ing  the   GetPipelineState  action. It is used to validate that the
          approval request corresponding to this token is still valid.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       approvedAt -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp showing when the approval or rejection was submitted.
