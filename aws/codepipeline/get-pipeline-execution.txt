GET-PIPELINE-EXECUTION()                              GET-PIPELINE-EXECUTION()



NAME
       get-pipeline-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about an execution of a pipeline, including details
       about artifacts, the pipeline execution ID, and the name, version,  and
       status of the pipeline.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-pipeline-execution
          --pipeline-name <value>
          --pipeline-execution-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pipeline-name (string)
          The  name  of the pipeline about which you want to get execution de-
          tails.

       --pipeline-execution-id (string)
          The ID of the pipeline execution about which you want to get  execu-
          tion details.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       pipelineExecution -> (structure)
          Represents information about the execution of a pipeline.

          pipelineName -> (string)
              The name of the pipeline with the specified pipeline execution.

          pipelineVersion -> (integer)
              The version number of the pipeline with the  specified  pipeline
              execution.

          pipelineExecutionId -> (string)
              The ID of the pipeline execution.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the pipeline execution.

              o Cancelled:  The  pipelines  definition  was updated before the
                pipeline execution could be completed.

              o InProgress: The pipeline execution is currently running.

              o Stopped: The pipeline execution was manually stopped. For more
                information, see Stopped Executions .

              o Stopping: The pipeline execution received a request to be man-
                ually stopped. Depending on the selected stop mode, the execu-
                tion  is  either completing or abandoning in-progress actions.
                For more information, see Stopped Executions .

              o Succeeded: The pipeline execution was completed successfully.

              o Superseded: While this pipeline execution was waiting for  the
                next  stage  to  be  completed, a newer pipeline execution ad-
                vanced and continued through the pipeline  instead.  For  more
                information, see Superseded Executions .

              o Failed: The pipeline execution was not completed successfully.

          statusSummary -> (string)
              A  summary that contains a description of the pipeline execution
              status.

          artifactRevisions -> (list)
              A list of ArtifactRevision objects included in a pipeline execu-
              tion.

              (structure)
                 Represents revision details of an artifact.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of an artifact. This name might be system-gener-
                     ated, such as "MyApp", or defined by the user when an ac-
                     tion is created.

                 revisionId -> (string)
                     The revision ID of the artifact.

                 revisionChangeIdentifier -> (string)
                     An additional identifier for a revision, such as a commit
                     date or, for artifacts stored in Amazon S3  buckets,  the
                     ETag value.

                 revisionSummary -> (string)
                     Summary information about the most recent revision of the
                     artifact. For GitHub and AWS CodeCommit repositories, the
                     commit  message.  For  Amazon  S3 buckets or actions, the
                     user-provided content  of  a  codepipeline-artifact-revi-
                     sion-summary key specified in the object metadata.

                 created -> (timestamp)
                     The  date  and  time when the most recent revision of the
                     artifact was created, in timestamp format.

                 revisionUrl -> (string)
                     The commit ID for the artifact  revision.  For  artifacts
                     stored in GitHub or AWS CodeCommit repositories, the com-
                     mit ID is linked to a commit details page.
