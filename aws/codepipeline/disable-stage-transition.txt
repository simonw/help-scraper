NAME
       disable-stage-transition -

DESCRIPTION
       Prevents  artifacts  in a pipeline from transitioning to the next stage
       in the pipeline.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disable-stage-transition
          --pipeline-name <value>
          --stage-name <value>
          --transition-type <value>
          --reason <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pipeline-name (string)
          The name of the pipeline in which you want to disable  the  flow  of
          artifacts from one stage to another.

       --stage-name (string)
          The  name of the stage where you want to disable the inbound or out-
          bound transition of artifacts.

       --transition-type (string)
          Specifies whether artifacts are prevented  from  transitioning  into
          the  stage  and  being  processed  by the actions in that stage (in-
          bound), or prevented from transitioning from the  stage  after  they
          have been processed by the actions in that stage (outbound).

          Possible values:

          o Inbound

          o Outbound

       --reason (string)
          The reason given to the user that a stage is disabled, such as wait-
          ing for manual approval or manual tests. This message  is  displayed
          in the pipeline console UI.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       This  example  disables transitions into the Beta stage of the MyFirst-
       Pipeline pipeline in AWS CodePipeline.

          aws codepipeline disable-stage-transition --pipeline-name MyFirstPipeline --stage-name Beta  --transition-type Inbound

       Output:

          None.

OUTPUT
       None
