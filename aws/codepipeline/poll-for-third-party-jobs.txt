       WARNING:
          When this API is called, AWS CodePipeline returns temporary  creden-
          tials for the S3 bucket used to store artifacts for the pipeline, if
          the action requires access to that S3 bucket for input or output ar-
          tifacts.

SYNOPSIS
            poll-for-third-party-jobs
          --action-type-id <value>
          [--max-batch-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --action-type-id (structure)
          Represents information about an action type.

          category -> (string)
              A  category  defines  what  kind  of  action can be taken in the
              stage, and constrains the provider type for  the  action.  Valid
              categories are limited to one of the following values.

              o Source

              o Build

              o Test

              o Deploy

              o Invoke

              o Approval

          owner -> (string)
              The  creator  of  the action being called. There are three valid
              values for the Owner field in the action category section within
              your  pipeline  structure:  AWS  , ThirdParty , and Custom . For
              more information, see Valid Action Types and Providers in  Code-
              Pipeline .

          provider -> (string)
              The  provider  of  the service being called by the action. Valid
              providers are determined by the action category. For example, an
              action  in the Deploy category type might have a provider of AWS
              CodeDeploy, which would be specified as CodeDeploy. For more in-
              formation,  see Valid Action Types and Providers in CodePipeline
              .

          version -> (string)
              A string that describes the action version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          category=string,owner=string,provider=string,version=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "category": "Source"|"Build"|"Deploy"|"Test"|"Invoke"|"Approval",
            "owner": "AWS"|"ThirdParty"|"Custom",
            "provider": "string",
            "version": "string"
          }

       --max-batch-size (integer)
          The maximum number of jobs to return in a poll for jobs call.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       jobs -> (list)
          Information about the jobs to take action on.

          (structure)
              A  response  to  a PollForThirdPartyJobs request returned by AWS
              CodePipeline when there is a job to be worked on  by  a  partner
              action.

              clientId -> (string)
                 The  clientToken portion of the clientId and clientToken pair
                 used to verify that the calling entity is allowed  access  to
                 the job and its details.

              jobId -> (string)
                 The identifier used to identify the job in AWS CodePipeline.
