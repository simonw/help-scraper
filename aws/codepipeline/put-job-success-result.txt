SYNOPSIS
            put-job-success-result
          --job-id <value>
          [--current-revision <value>]
          [--continuation-token <value>]
          [--execution-details <value>]
          [--output-variables <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The unique system-generated ID of the job that  succeeded.  This  is
          the same ID returned from PollForJobs .

       --current-revision (structure)
          The  ID  of the current revision of the artifact successfully worked
          on by the job.

          revision -> (string)
              The revision ID of the current version of an artifact.

          changeIdentifier -> (string)
              The change identifier for the current revision.

          created -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the most recent revision of the  artifact
              was created, in timestamp format.

          revisionSummary -> (string)
              The summary of the most recent revision of the artifact.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          revision=string,changeIdentifier=string,created=timestamp,revisionSummary=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "revision": "string",
            "changeIdentifier": "string",
            "created": timestamp,
            "revisionSummary": "string"
          }

       --continuation-token (string)
          A token generated by a job worker, such as an AWS CodeDeploy deploy-
          ment ID, that a successful job provides to identify a custom  action
          in  progress. Future jobs use this token to identify the running in-
          stance of the action. It can be reused to  return  more  information
          about  the  progress  of  the custom action. When the action is com-
          plete, no continuation token should be supplied.

       --execution-details (structure)
          The execution details of the successful job,  such  as  the  actions
          taken by the job worker.

          summary -> (string)
              The summary of the current status of the actions.

          externalExecutionId -> (string)
              The  system-generated  unique ID of this action used to identify
              this job worker in any external systems, such as AWS CodeDeploy.

          percentComplete -> (integer)
              The percentage of work completed on the action, represented on a
              scale of 0 to 100 percent.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          summary=string,externalExecutionId=string,percentComplete=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "summary": "string",
            "externalExecutionId": "string",
            "percentComplete": integer
          }

       --output-variables (map)
          Key-value  pairs produced as output by a job worker that can be made
          available to a downstream action configuration. outputVariables  can
          be included only when there is no continuation token on the request.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
