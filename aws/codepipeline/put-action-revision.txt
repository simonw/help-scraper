DESCRIPTION
       Provides  information  to  AWS  CodePipeline  about  new revisions to a

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-action-revision
          --pipeline-name <value>
          --stage-name <value>
          --action-name <value>
          --action-revision <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pipeline-name (string)
          The name of the pipeline that starts processing the revision to  the
          source.

       --stage-name (string)
          The  name of the stage that contains the action that acts on the re-
          vision.

       --action-name (string)
          The name of the action that processes the revision.

       --action-revision (structure)
          Represents information about the version (or revision) of an action.

          revisionId -> (string)
              The system-generated unique ID that identifies the revision num-
              ber of the action.

          revisionChangeId -> (string)
              The  unique  identifier of the change that set the state to this
              revision (for example, a deployment ID or timestamp).

          created -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the most recent version of the action was
              created, in timestamp format.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          revisionId=string,revisionChangeId=string,created=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "revisionId": "string",
            "revisionChangeId": "string",
            "created": timestamp
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       newRevision -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether the artifact revision was previously  used  in  an
          execution of the specified pipeline.

       pipelineExecutionId -> (string)
          The ID of the current workflow state of the pipeline.
