OPTIONS
       --category (string)
          The category of the custom action, such as a build action or a  test
          action.

          Possible values:

          o Source

          o Build

          o Deploy

          o Test

          o Invoke

          o Approval

       --provider (string)
          The  provider  of the service used in the custom action, such as AWS
          CodeDeploy.

       --settings (structure)
          URLs that provide users information about this custom action.

          thirdPartyConfigurationUrl -> (string)
              The URL of a sign-up page where users can sign up for an  exter-
              nal service and perform initial configuration of the action pro-
              vided by that service.

          entityUrlTemplate -> (string)
              The URL returned to the AWS CodePipeline console that provides a
              deep  link  to the resources of the external system, such as the

              the pipeline view page in the AWS CodePipeline console and  pro-
              vides a link to the execution entity of the external action.

          revisionUrlTemplate -> (string)
              The URL returned to the AWS CodePipeline console that contains a

       Shorthand Syntax:

          thirdPartyConfigurationUrl=string,entityUrlTemplate=string,executionUrlTemplate=string,revisionUrlTemplate=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "thirdPartyConfigurationUrl": "string",
            "entityUrlTemplate": "string",
            "executionUrlTemplate": "string",
            "revisionUrlTemplate": "string"
          }

       --configuration-properties (list)
          The configuration properties for the custom action.

          NOTE:
              You  can  refer to a name in the configuration properties of the
              custom action within the URL templates by following  the  format
              of  {Config:name}, as long as the configuration property is both
              required and not secret. For more information, see Create a Cus-
              tom Action for a Pipeline .

          (structure)
              Represents information about an action configuration property.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the action configuration property.

              required -> (boolean)
                 Whether the configuration property is a required value.

              key -> (boolean)
                 Whether the configuration property is a key.

              secret -> (boolean)
                 Whether  the  configuration  property  is secret. Secrets are
                 hidden from all calls except for GetJobDetails , GetThirdPar-
                 tyJobDetails , PollForJobs , and PollForThirdPartyJobs .

                 When  updating a pipeline, passing * * * * * without changing
                 any other values of the action preserves the  previous  value
                 of the secret.

              queryable -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  that  the property is used with PollForJobs . When
                 creating a custom action,  an  action  can  have  up  to  one
                 queryable property. If it has one, that property must be both
                 required and not secret.

                 If you create a pipeline with a custom action type, and  that
                 custom  action  contains  a queryable property, the value for
                 that configuration property is subject to other restrictions.
                 The  value  must be less than or equal to twenty (20) charac-
                 ters. The value can contain only alphanumeric characters, un-
                 derscores, and hyphens.

              description -> (string)
                 The  description of the action configuration property that is
                 displayed to users.

              type -> (string)
                 The type of the configuration property.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,required=boolean,key=boolean,secret=boolean,queryable=boolean,description=string,type=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          ID.

          minimumCount -> (integer)
              The minimum number of artifacts allowed for the action type.

          maximumCount -> (integer)
              The maximum number of artifacts allowed for the action type.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          minimumCount=integer,maximumCount=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "minimumCount": integer,

          ID.

          minimumCount -> (integer)
              The minimum number of artifacts allowed for the action type.

          maximumCount -> (integer)
              The maximum number of artifacts allowed for the action type.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          minimumCount=integer,maximumCount=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "minimumCount": integer,
            "maximumCount": integer
          }

       --tags (list)
          The tags for the custom action.

          (structure)
              A tag is a key-value pair that is used to manage the resource.

              value -> (string)
                 The tag's value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --action-version (string)
          The version identifier of the custom action.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a custom action

       This  example creates a custom action for AWS CodePipeline using an al-
       ready-created JSON file (here named MyCustomAction.json) that  contains
       the  structure of the custom action. For more information about the re-
       quirements for creating a custom action, including the structure of the
       file, see the AWS CodePipeline User Guide.

          aws codepipeline create-custom-action-type --cli-input-json file://MyCustomAction.json

       Contents of JSON file MyCustomAction.json:

          {
              "category": "Build",
              "provider": "MyJenkinsProviderName",
              "version": "1",
              "settings": {
                  "entityUrlTemplate": "https://192.0.2.4/job/{Config:ProjectName}/",
                  "executionUrlTemplate": "https://192.0.2.4/job/{Config:ProjectName}/lastSuccessfulBuild/{ExternalExecutionId}/"
              },
              "configurationProperties": [
                  {
                      "name": "MyJenkinsExampleBuildProject",
                      "required": true,
                      "key": true,
                      "secret": false,
                      "queryable": false,
                      "description": "The name of the build project must be provided when this action is added to the pipeline.",
                      "type": "String"
                  }
              ],
              "inputArtifactDetails": {
                  "maximumCount": 1,
                  "minimumCount": 0
              },

                  "minimumCount": 0
              }
          }

       This command returns the structure of the custom action.

OUTPUT
       actionType -> (structure)
          Returns information about the details of an action type.

          id -> (structure)
              Represents information about an action type.

              category -> (string)
                 A  category  defines  what kind of action can be taken in the
                 stage, and constrains the provider type for the action. Valid
                 categories are limited to one of the following values.

                 o Source

                 o Build

                 o Test

                 o Deploy

                 o Approval

              owner -> (string)
                 The creator of the action being called. There are three valid
                 values for the Owner field in  the  action  category  section
                 within your pipeline structure: AWS , ThirdParty , and Custom
                 . For more information, see Valid Action Types and  Providers

              provider -> (string)
                 The provider of the service being called by the action. Valid
                 providers are determined by the action category. For example,
                 an  action  in the Deploy category type might have a provider
                 of AWS CodeDeploy, which would be  specified  as  CodeDeploy.
                 For more information, see Valid Action Types and Providers in
                 CodePipeline .

                 The URL returned to the AWS CodePipeline  console  that  pro-
                 vides  a  deep  link to the resources of the external system,
                 such as the configuration page for an AWS CodeDeploy  deploy-
                 ment  group. This link is provided as part of the action dis-
                 play in the pipeline.

              executionUrlTemplate -> (string)
                 The URL returned to the AWS CodePipeline  console  that  con-
                 tains  a  link to the top-level landing page for the external
                 system, such as the console page  for  AWS  CodeDeploy.  This
                 link  is  shown  on  the  pipeline view page in the AWS Code-
                 Pipeline console and provides a link to the execution  entity

                 secret -> (boolean)
                     Whether the configuration property is secret. Secrets are
                     hidden  from  all  calls  except for GetJobDetails , Get-
                     ThirdPartyJobDetails , PollForJobs , and PollForThirdPar-
                     tyJobs .

                     When  updating  a  pipeline,  passing  *  * * * * without
                     changing any other values of  the  action  preserves  the
                     previous value of the secret.

                 queryable -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  that  the  property is used with PollForJobs .
                     When creating a custom action, an action can have  up  to
                     one queryable property. If it has one, that property must
                     be both required and not secret.

                     If you create a pipeline with a custom action  type,  and
                     that  custom  action  contains  a queryable property, the
                     value for that configuration property is subject to other
                     restrictions.  The  value  must  be less than or equal to
                     twenty (20) characters. The value can  contain  only  al-
