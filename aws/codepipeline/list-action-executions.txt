LIST-ACTION-EXECUTIONS()                              LIST-ACTION-EXECUTIONS()



NAME
       list-action-executions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the action executions that have occurred in a pipeline.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-action-executions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: actionExecutionDetails

SYNOPSIS
            list-action-executions
          --pipeline-name <value>
          [--filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pipeline-name (string)
          The name of the pipeline for which you want to list action execution
          history.

       --filter (structure)
          Input information used to filter action execution history.

          pipelineExecutionId -> (string)
              The  pipeline  execution ID used to filter action execution his-
              tory.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          pipelineExecutionId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "pipelineExecutionId": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list action executions

       The following list-action-executions example views action execution de-
       tails  for  a  pipeline,  such as action execution ID, input artifacts,
       output artifacts, execution result, and status.

          tion ID.

              Returns information about an execution of an  action,  including
              the  action  execution  ID, and the name, version, and timing of
              the action.

              input -> (structure)
                 Input details for the action execution, such as role ARN, Re-
                 gion, and input artifacts.

                 actionTypeId -> (structure)
                     Represents information about an action type.

                     category -> (string)
                        A category defines what kind of action can be taken in
                        the  stage,  and  constrains the provider type for the
                        action. Valid categories are limited  to  one  of  the
                        following values.

                        o Source

                        o Build

                        o Test

                        o Deploy

                        o Invoke

                        o Approval

                        The  creator  of  the  action  being called. There are
                        three valid values for the Owner field in  the  action
                        category section within your pipeline structure: AWS ,
                        ThirdParty , and Custom . For  more  information,  see

                     provider -> (string)
                        The  provider  of  the service being called by the ac-
                        tion. Valid providers are  determined  by  the  action
                        category.  For  example, an action in the Deploy cate-
                        gory type might have a  provider  of  AWS  CodeDeploy,
                        which  would  be specified as CodeDeploy. For more in-
                        formation, see Valid Action  Types  and  Providers  in
                        CodePipeline .

                 roleArn -> (string)
                     The  ARN  of  the  IAM service role that performs the de-
                     clared action. This is assumed through  the  roleArn  for
                     the pipeline.

                 region -> (string)
                     The AWS Region for the action, such as us-east-1.
