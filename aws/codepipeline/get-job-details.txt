GET-JOB-DETAILS()                                            GET-JOB-DETAILS()



NAME
       get-job-details -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about a job. Used for custom actions only.

       WARNING:
          When  this API is called, AWS CodePipeline returns temporary creden-
          tials for the S3 bucket used to store artifacts for the pipeline, if
          the action requires access to that S3 bucket for input or output ar-
          tifacts. This API also returns any secret values defined for the ac-
          tion.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-job-details
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The unique system-generated ID for the job.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get details of a job

       This  example  returns  details  about a job whose ID is represented by
       f4f4ff82-2d11-EXAMPLE. This command is only used  for  custom  actions.
       When this command is called, AWS CodePipeline returns temporary creden-
       tials for the Amazon S3 bucket used to store artifacts  for  the  pipe-
       line,  if required for the custom action. This command will also return
       any secret values defined for the action, if any are defined.

       Command:

          aws codepipeline get-job-details --job-id f4f4ff82-2d11-EXAMPLE

       jobDetails -> (structure)
          The details of the job.

          NOTE:
              If AWSSessionCredentials is used, a long-running  job  can  call
              GetJobDetails again to obtain new credentials.

          id -> (string)
              The unique system-generated ID of the job.

          data -> (structure)
              Represents  other  information  about  a  job required for a job
              worker to complete the job.

              actionTypeId -> (structure)
                 Represents information about an action type.

                 category -> (string)
                     A category defines what kind of action can  be  taken  in
                     the  stage,  and constrains the provider type for the ac-
                     tion. Valid categories are limited to one of the  follow-
                     ing values.

                     o Source

                     o Build

                     o Test

                     o Deploy

                     o Invoke

                     o Approval

                 owner -> (string)
                     The  creator  of the action being called. There are three
                     valid values for the Owner field in the  action  category
                     section  within your pipeline structure: AWS , ThirdParty
                     , and Custom . For more  information,  see  Valid  Action

                     The  provider  of the service being called by the action.
                     Valid providers are determined by  the  action  category.
                     For  example, an action in the Deploy category type might
                     have a provider of AWS CodeDeploy, which would be  speci-
                     fied  as  CodeDeploy. For more information, see Valid Ac-
                     tion Types and Providers in CodePipeline .

                 Represents  an  AWS session credentials object. These creden-
                 tials are temporary credentials that are issued by AWS Secure
                 Token  Service  (STS).  They  can be used to access input and

                 the  artifact  store,  such  as an AWS Key Management Service
                 (AWS KMS) key.

                 id -> (string)
                     The ID used to identify the key. For an AWS KMS key,  you
                     can use the key ID, the key ARN, or the alias ARN.

                     NOTE:
                        Aliases  are  recognized only in the account that cre-
                        ated the customer master key (CMK). For  cross-account
                        actions,  you  can  only  use the key ID or key ARN to
                        identify the key.

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of encryption key, such as an AWS Key Management
                     Service  (AWS KMS) key. When creating or updating a pipe-
                     line, the value must be set to 'KMS'.

          accountId -> (string)
              The AWS account ID associated with the job.
