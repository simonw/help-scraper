SYNOPSIS
            modify-event-subscription
          --subscription-name <value>
          [--sns-topic-arn <value>]
          [--source-type <value>]
          [--event-categories <value>]
          [--enabled | --no-enabled]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subscription-name (string)
          The name of the DMS event notification subscription to be modified.

       --sns-topic-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic created for
          event notification. The ARN is created by Amazon SNS when you create
          a topic and subscribe to it.

       --source-type (string)
          The  type of DMS resource that generates the events you want to sub-
          scribe to.

          Valid values: replication-instance | replication-task

       --event-categories (list)
          A list of event categories for a source type that you want  to  sub-
          scribe  to.  Use the DescribeEventCategories action to see a list of
          event categories.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --enabled | --no-enabled (boolean)
          A Boolean value; set to true to activate the subscription.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To modify an event subscription

       The following modify-event-subscription example changes the source type
       of an event subscription.

          aws dms modify-event-subscription \
              --subscription-name "my-dms-events" \
              --source-type replication-task

       Output:

          {
              "EventSubscription": {
                  "CustomerAwsId": "123456789012",
                  "CustSubscriptionId": "my-dms-events",
                  "SnsTopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-sns-topic",
                  "Status": "modifying",
                  "SubscriptionCreationTime": "2020-05-29 17:04:40.262",
                  "SourceType": "replication-task",
                  "Enabled": true
              }
          }
