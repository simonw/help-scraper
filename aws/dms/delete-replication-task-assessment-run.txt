DELETE-REPLICATION-TASK-ASSESSMENT-RUNDELETE-REPLICATION-TASK-ASSESSMENT-RUN()



NAME
       delete-replication-task-assessment-run -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the record of a single premigration assessment run.

       This  operation  removes all metadata that DMS maintains about this as-
       sessment run. However, the operation leaves untouched  all  information
       about this assessment run that is stored in your Amazon S3 bucket.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-replication-task-assessment-run
          --replication-task-assessment-run-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --replication-task-assessment-run-arn (string)
          Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the premigration assessment run to be
          deleted.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
