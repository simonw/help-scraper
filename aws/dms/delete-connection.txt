DELETE-CONNECTION()                                        DELETE-CONNECTION()



NAME
       delete-connection -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the connection between a replication instance and an endpoint.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-connection
          --endpoint-arn <value>
          --replication-instance-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --endpoint-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) string that uniquely identifies the
          endpoint.

       --replication-instance-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replication instance.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a connection

       The following delete-connection example disassociates an endpoint  from
       a replication instance.

          aws dms delete-connection \
              --endpoint-arn arn:aws:dms:us-east-1:123456789012:endpoint:6GGI6YPWWGAYUVLKIB732KEVWA \
              --replication-instance-arn arn:aws:dms:us-east-1:123456789012:rep:T3OM7OUB5NM2LCVZF7JPGJRNUE

       Output:

          {
              "Connection": {
                  "ReplicationInstanceArn": "arn:aws:dms:us-east-1:123456789012:rep:T3OM7OUB5NM2LCVZF7JPGJRNUE",
                  "EndpointArn": "arn:aws:dms:us-east-1:123456789012:endpoint:6GGI6YPWWGAYUVLKIB732KEVWA",
                  "Status": "deleting",
                  "EndpointIdentifier": "src-database-1",
                  "ReplicationInstanceIdentifier": "my-repl-instance"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       Connection -> (structure)
          The connection that is being deleted.

          ReplicationInstanceArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the replication instance.

          EndpointArn -> (string)
              The ARN string that uniquely identifies the endpoint.

          Status -> (string)
              The connection status. This parameter can return one of the fol-
              lowing values:

              o "successful"

              o "testing"

              o "failed"

              o "deleting"

          LastFailureMessage -> (string)
              The error message when the connection last failed.

          EndpointIdentifier -> (string)
              The identifier of the endpoint. Identifiers must  begin  with  a
              letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens.
              They can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          ReplicationInstanceIdentifier -> (string)
              The replication instance identifier. This parameter is stored as
              a lowercase string.
