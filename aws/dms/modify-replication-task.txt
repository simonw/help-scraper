NAME
       modify-replication-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies the specified replication task.

       You  can't  modify  the task endpoints. The task must be stopped before
       you can modify it.

       For more information about DMS tasks, see Working with Migration  Tasks
       in the Database Migration Service User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-replication-task
          --replication-task-arn <value>
          [--replication-task-identifier <value>]
          [--migration-type <value>]
          [--table-mappings <value>]
          [--replication-task-settings <value>]
          [--cdc-start-time <value>]
          [--cdc-start-position <value>]
          [--cdc-stop-position <value>]
          [--task-data <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --replication-task-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replication task.

       --replication-task-identifier (string)
          The replication task identifier.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain 1-255 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.

          o First character must be a letter.

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

       --migration-type (string)
          The    migration   type.   Valid   values:   full-load   |   cdc   |
          full-load-and-cdc

          Possible values:

          o full-load

          o cdc

          o full-load-and-cdc

       --table-mappings (string)
          When using the CLI or boto3, provide the path of the JSON file  that
          contains the table mappings. Precede the path with file:// . For ex-
          ample, --table-mappings file://mappingfile.json . When working  with
          the DMS API, provide the JSON as the parameter value.

       --replication-task-settings (string)
          JSON file that contains settings for the task, such as task metadata
          settings.

       --cdc-start-time (timestamp)
          Indicates the start time for a change data capture (CDC)  operation.
          Use either CdcStartTime or CdcStartPosition to specify when you want
          a CDC operation to start. Specifying both values results in  an  er-
          ror.

          Timestamp Example: --cdc-start-time 2018-03-08T12:12:12

       --cdc-start-position (string)
          Indicates  when  you  want  a change data capture (CDC) operation to
          start. Use either CdcStartPosition or CdcStartTime to  specify  when
          you want a CDC operation to start. Specifying both values results in
          an error.

          The value can be in date, checkpoint, or LSN/SCN format.

          Date Example: --cdc-start-position 2018-03-08T12:12:12

          Checkpoint       Example:        --cdc-start-position        "check-
          point:V1#27#mysql-bin-changelog.157832:1975:-1:2002:677883278264080:mysql-bin-changelog.157832:1876#0#0#*#0#93"

          LSN Example: --cdc-start-position mysql-bin-changelog.000024:373

          NOTE:
              When you use this task setting with a  source  PostgreSQL  data-
              base,  a  logical replication slot should already be created and
              associated with the source endpoint. You can verify this by set-
              ting the slotName extra connection attribute to the name of this
              logical replication slot. For more information, see  Extra  Con-
              nection Attributes When Using PostgreSQL as a Source for DMS .

       --cdc-stop-position (string)
          Indicates  when  you  want  a change data capture (CDC) operation to
          stop. The value can be either server time or commit time.

          Server          time          example:           --cdc-stop-position
          server_time:2018-02-09T12:12:12

          Commit     time     example:     --cdc-stop-position    commit_time:
          2018-02-09T12:12:12

       --task-data (string)
          Supplemental information that the task requires to migrate the  data
          for  certain  source and target endpoints. For more information, see
          Specifying Supplemental Data for Task Settings in the  Database  Mi-
          gration Service User Guide.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun.html`__
                 is  an improved premigration task assessment operation. The `
                 StartReplicationTaskAssessment
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessment.html`__
                 operation assesses data type compatibility only  between  the
                 source and target database of a given migration task. In con-
                 trast,          `           StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun.html`__
                 enables you to specify a variety of premigration task assess-
                 ments  in  addition to data type compatibility. These assess-
                 ments include ones for the validity of  primary  key  defini-
                 tions  and likely issues with database migration performance,
                 among others.

          LastFailureMessage -> (string)
              The last error (failure) message generated for  the  replication
              task.

          StopReason -> (string)
              The  reason  the replication task was stopped. This response pa-
              rameter can return one of the following values:

              o "STOP_REASON_FULL_LOAD_COMPLETED"   Full-load  migration  com-
                pleted.

              o "STOP_REASON_CACHED_CHANGES_APPLIED"    Change   data  capture
                (CDC) load completed.

              o "STOP_REASON_CACHED_CHANGES_NOT_APPLIED"  In a  full-load  and
                CDC  migration,  the  full  load  stopped  as specified before
                starting the CDC migration.

              o "STOP_REASON_SERVER_TIME"  The migration stopped at the speci-
                fied server time.

          ReplicationTaskCreationDate -> (timestamp)
              The date the replication task was created.

          ReplicationTaskStartDate -> (timestamp)
              The date the replication task is scheduled to start.

          CdcStartPosition -> (string)
              Indicates when you want a change data capture (CDC) operation to
              start. Use either CdcStartPosition or  CdcStartTime  to  specify
              when you want the CDC operation to start. Specifying both values
              results in an error.

              The value can be in date, checkpoint, or LSN/SCN format.

              Date Example: --cdc-start-position 2018-03-08T12:12:12

              Checkpoint      Example:      --cdc-start-position       "check-

          CdcStopPosition -> (string)
              Indicates when you want a change data capture (CDC) operation to
              stop. The value can be either server time or commit time.

          RecoveryCheckpoint -> (string)
              Indicates the last checkpoint that occurred during a change data
              capture (CDC) operation. You can provide this value to the  Cdc-
              StartPosition  parameter to start a CDC operation that begins at
              that checkpoint.
