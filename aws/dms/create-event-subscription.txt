CREATE-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTION()                        CREATE-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTION()



NAME
       create-event-subscription -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an DMS event notification subscription.

       You  can  specify the type of source (SourceType ) you want to be noti-
       fied of, provide a list of DMS source IDs (SourceIds  )  that  triggers
       the  events,  and provide a list of event categories (EventCategories )
       for events you want to be notified of. If you specify both the  Source-
       Type  and  SourceIds  ,  such  as SourceType = replication-instance and
       SourceIdentifier = my-replinstance , you will be notified  of  all  the
       replication  instance events for the specified source. If you specify a
       SourceType but don't specify a SourceIdentifier , you receive notice of
       the  events for that source type for all your DMS sources. If you don't
       specify either SourceType nor SourceIdentifier , you will  be  notified
       of events generated from all DMS sources belonging to your customer ac-
       count.

       For more information about DMS events, see Working with Events and  No-
       tifications in the Database Migration Service User Guide.

SYNOPSIS
            create-event-subscription
          --subscription-name <value>
          --sns-topic-arn <value>
          [--source-type <value>]
          [--event-categories <value>]
          [--source-ids <value>]
          [--enabled | --no-enabled]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subscription-name (string)
          The  name of the DMS event notification subscription. This name must
          be less than 255 characters.

       --sns-topic-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic  created  for
          event notification. The ARN is created by Amazon SNS when you create
          a topic and subscribe to it.

       --source-type (string)
          The type of DMS resource that generates the events. For example,  if
          you  want  to  be  notified of events generated by a replication in-
          stance, you set this parameter to  replication-instance  .  If  this
          value isn't specified, all events are returned.

          Valid values: replication-instance | replication-task

       --event-categories (list)
          A  list  of event categories for a source type that you want to sub-
          scribe to. For more information, see Working with Events and Notifi-
          cations in the Database Migration Service User Guide.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --source-ids (list)
          A list of identifiers for which DMS provides notification events.

          If  you  don't  specify  a value, notifications are provided for all
          sources.

          If you specify multiple values, they must be of the same  type.  For
          example,  if  you  specify  a  database instance ID, then all of the
          other values must be database instance IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --enabled | --no-enabled (boolean)
          A Boolean value; set to true to activate the subscription, or set to
          false to create the subscription but not activate it.

       --tags (list)
          One or more tags to be assigned to the event subscription.

          (structure)
              A  user-defined  key-value pair that describes metadata added to
              an DMS resource and that is used by operations such as the  fol-
              lowing:

              o AddTagsToResource

              o ListTagsForResource

              o RemoveTagsFromResource

              Key -> (string)
                 A  key  is the required name of the tag. The string value can
                 be 1-128 Unicode characters in length and can't  be  prefixed
                 with  "aws:"  or "dms:". The string can only contain only the
                 set of Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_',  '.',  '/',
                 '=',      '+',     '-'     (Java     regular     expressions:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A value is the optional value of the tag.  The  string  value
                 can  be  1-256 Unicode characters in length and can't be pre-
                 fixed with "aws:" or "dms:". The string can only contain only
                 the  set  of  Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.',
                 '/',   '=',   '+',    '-'    (Java    regular    expressions:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) string that uniquely identi-
                 fies the resource for which the tag is created.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,ResourceArn=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "ResourceArn": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list event subscriptions

       The following create-event-subscription example creates an  event  sub-
       scription to an Amazon SNS topic (my-sns-topic).

          aws dms create-event-subscription \
              --subscription-name my-dms-events \
              --sns-topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-sns-topic

       Output:

          {
              "EventSubscription": {
                  "CustomerAwsId": "123456789012",
                  "CustSubscriptionId": "my-dms-events",
                  "SnsTopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-sns-topic",
                  "Status": "creating",
                  "SubscriptionCreationTime": "2020-05-21 21:58:38.598",
                  "Enabled": true
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       EventSubscription -> (structure)
          The event subscription that was created.

          CustomerAwsId -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services customer account associated with the DMS
              event notification subscription.

          CustSubscriptionId -> (string)
              The DMS event notification subscription Id.

          SnsTopicArn -> (string)
              The topic ARN of the DMS event notification subscription.

          Status -> (string)

              active | no-permission | topic-not-exist

              The status "no-permission" indicates that DMS no longer has per-
              mission  to  post to the SNS topic. The status "topic-not-exist"
              indicates that the topic was deleted after the subscription  was
              created.

              Valid  values: replication-instance | replication-server | secu-
              rity-group | replication-task

          SourceIdsList -> (list)
              A list of source Ids for the event subscription.

              (string)
