NAME
       modify-replication-subnet-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies the settings for the specified replication subnet group.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-replication-subnet-group
          --replication-subnet-group-identifier <value>
          [--replication-subnet-group-description <value>]
          --subnet-ids <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --replication-subnet-group-identifier (string)
          The name of the replication instance subnet group.

       --replication-subnet-group-description (string)
          A description for the replication instance subnet group.

       --subnet-ids (list)
          A list of subnet IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To modify a subnet group

       The following modify-replication-subnet-group example changes the lists
       of subnets associated with a subnet group.

          aws dms modify-replication-subnet-group \
              --replication-subnet-group-identifier my-subnet-group \
              --subnet-id subnet-da327bf6 subnet-bac383e0

       Output:

          {
              "ReplicationSubnetGroup": {
                  "ReplicationSubnetGroupIdentifier": "my-subnet-group",
                  "ReplicationSubnetGroupDescription": "my subnet group",
                  "VpcId": "vpc-136a4c6a",
                  "SubnetGroupStatus": "Complete",
                  "Subnets": [
                      {
                          "SubnetIdentifier": "subnet-da327bf6",
                          "SubnetAvailabilityZone": {
                              "Name": "us-east-1a"
                          },
                          "SubnetStatus": "Active"
                      },
                      {
                          "SubnetIdentifier": "subnet-bac383e0",
                          "SubnetAvailabilityZone": {
                              "Name": "us-east-1c"
                          },
                          "SubnetStatus": "Active"
                      }
                  ]
              }
          }
