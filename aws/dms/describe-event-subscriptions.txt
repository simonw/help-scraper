DESCRIBE-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTIONS()                  DESCRIBE-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTIONS()



NAME
       describe-event-subscriptions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all the event subscriptions for a customer account. The descrip-
       tion of a subscription includes SubscriptionName , SNSTopicARN  ,  Cus-
       tomerID , SourceType , SourceID , CreationTime , and Status .

       If you specify SubscriptionName , this action lists the description for
       that subscription.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-event-subscriptions is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: EventSubscriptionsList

SYNOPSIS
            describe-event-subscriptions
          [--subscription-name <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subscription-name (string)
          The name of the DMS event subscription to be described.

       --filters (list)
          Filters applied to event subscriptions.

          Valid filter names: event-subscription-arn | event-subscription-id

          (structure)
              Identifies the name and value of a filter object. This filter is
              used to limit the number and type of DMS objects  that  are  re-
              turned  for  a  particular  Describe* call or similar operation.
              Filters are used as an optional parameter for certain API opera-
              tions.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name of the filter as specified for a Describe* or simi-
                 lar operation.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter value, which can specify one or more  values  used
                 to narrow the returned results.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

          A list of event subscriptions.

          (structure)
              Describes an event notification subscription created by the Cre-
              ateEventSubscription operation.

              CustomerAwsId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services customer account associated with  the
                 DMS event notification subscription.

              CustSubscriptionId -> (string)
                 The DMS event notification subscription Id.

              SnsTopicArn -> (string)
                 The topic ARN of the DMS event notification subscription.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the DMS event notification subscription.

                 Constraints:

                 Can  be one of the following: creating | modifying | deleting
                 | active | no-permission | topic-not-exist

                 The status "no-permission" indicates that DMS no  longer  has
                 permission   to   post   to   the   SNS   topic.  The  status
                 "topic-not-exist" indicates that the topic was deleted  after
