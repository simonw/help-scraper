OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Filters applied to the target engine  recommendations  described  in
          the form of key-value pairs.

          (structure)
              Identifies the name and value of a filter object. This filter is
              used to limit the number and type of DMS objects  that  are  re-
              turned  for  a  particular  Describe* call or similar operation.
              Filters are used as an optional parameter for certain API opera-
              tions.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name of the filter as specified for a Describe* or simi-
                 lar operation.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter value, which can specify one or more  values  used
                 to narrow the returned results.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-records (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of records to include in the response. If more
          records exist than the specified MaxRecords value, Fleet Advisor in-
          cludes  a  pagination token in the response so that you can retrieve
          the remaining results.

       --next-token (string)
          Specifies the unique pagination token that makes it possible to dis-
          play  the  next page of results. If this parameter is specified, the
          response includes only records beyond the marker, up  to  the  value
          specified by MaxRecords .

          If  NextToken is returned by a previous response, there are more re-
          sults available. The value of NextToken is a unique pagination token
          for  each  page. Make the call again using the returned token to re-
          trieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The unique pagination token returned for you to pass to a subsequent
          request. Fleet Advisor returns this token when the number of records
          in the response is greater than the MaxRecords  value.  To  retrieve
          the  next  page,  make  the  call again using the returned token and
          keeping all other arguments unchanged.

       Recommendations -> (list)
          The list of recommendations of target  engines  that  Fleet  Advisor
          created for the source database.

          (structure)
              Provides information that describes a recommendation of a target
              engine.

              A recommendation is a set of possible Amazon Web Services target
              engines  that  you can choose to migrate your source on-premises
              database. In this set, Fleet Advisor suggests  a  single  target
              engine  as  the  right sized migration destination. To determine
              this rightsized migration destination, Fleet  Advisor  uses  the
              inventory  metadata and metrics from data collector. You can use
              recommendations before the start of migration to save costs  and
              reduce risks.

              With  recommendations,  you can explore different target options
              and compare metrics, so you can make an informed  decision  when
              you choose the migration target.

              DatabaseId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the source database for which Fleet Advisor
                 provided this recommendation.

                 The name of the target engine. Valid values include  "rds-au-
                 rora-mysql"   ,   "rds-aurora-postgresql"   ,  "rds-mysql"  ,
                 "rds-oracle" , "rds-sql-server" , and "rds-postgresql" .

              CreatedDate -> (string)
                 The date when Fleet Advisor created the target engine  recom-
                 mendation.

              Status -> (string)
                 The  status of the target engine recommendation. Valid values
                 include "alternate" ,  "in-progress"  ,  "not-viable"  ,  and
                 "recommended" .

              Preferred -> (boolean)
                 Indicates that this target is the rightsized migration desti-
                 nation.

              Settings -> (structure)
                 The settings in JSON format for the preferred  target  engine
                 parameters.  These parameters include capacity, resource uti-
                 lization, and the usage  type  (production,  development,  or
                 testing).

                 InstanceSizingType -> (string)
                     The  size  of  your target instance. Fleet Advisor calcu-
                     lates this value based on your data collection type, such
                     as  total capacity and resource utilization. Valid values
                     include "total-capacity" and "utilization" .

                 WorkloadType -> (string)
                     The deployment option for your target engine. For produc-
                     tion  databases,  Fleet  Advisor chooses Multi-AZ deploy-
                     ment. For development or test  databases,  Fleet  Advisor
                     chooses  Single-AZ  deployment. Valid values include "de-
