SYNOPSIS
            import-certificate
          --certificate-identifier <value>
          [--certificate-pem <value>]
          [--certificate-wallet <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-identifier (string)
          A customer-assigned name for the certificate. Identifiers must begin
          with a letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits,  and  hy-
          phens.  They  can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hy-
          phens.

       --certificate-pem (string)
          The contents of a .pem file, which contains an X.509 certificate.

       --certificate-wallet (blob)
          The location of an imported Oracle Wallet certificate for  use  with
          SSL.  Provide the name of a .sso file using the fileb:// prefix. You
          can't provide the certificate inline.

          Example: filebase64("${path.root}/rds-ca-2019-root.sso")

       --tags (list)
          The tags associated with the certificate.

          (structure)
              A user-defined key-value pair that describes metadata  added  to
              an  DMS resource and that is used by operations such as the fol-
              lowing:

              o AddTagsToResource

              o ListTagsForResource

              o RemoveTagsFromResource

              Key -> (string)
                 A key is the required name of the tag. The string  value  can
                 be  1-128  Unicode characters in length and can't be prefixed
                 with "aws:" or "dms:". The string can only contain  only  the
                 set  of  Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.', '/',
                 '=',     '+',     '-'     (Java     regular      expressions:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  is  the optional value of the tag. The string value
                 can be 1-256 Unicode characters in length and can't  be  pre-
                 fixed with "aws:" or "dms:". The string can only contain only
                 the set of Unicode letters, digits,  white-space,  '_',  '.',
                 '/',    '=',    '+',    '-'    (Java   regular   expressions:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) string that  uniquely  identi-
                 fies the resource for which the tag is created.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,ResourceArn=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "ResourceArn": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
