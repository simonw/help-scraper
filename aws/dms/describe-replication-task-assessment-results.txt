NAME
       describe-replication-task-assessment-results -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the task assessment results from the Amazon S3 bucket that DMS
       creates in your Amazon Web Services account. This action always returns
       the latest results.

       For  more  information  about DMS task assessments, see Creating a task
       assessment report in the Database Migration Service User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-replication-task-assessment-results is a paginated  operation.
       Multiple  API  calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data
       set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the  --no-pagi-
       nate  argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a
       paginated response, the --query argument must extract data from the re-
       sults  of the following query expressions: ReplicationTaskAssessmentRe-
       sults

SYNOPSIS
            describe-replication-task-assessment-results
          [--replication-task-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --replication-task-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) string that uniquely  identifies  the
          task.  When  this input parameter is specified, the API returns only
          one result and ignore the values of the MaxRecords and Marker param-
          eters.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this

                 The replication task identifier of the task on which the task
                 assessment was run.

              ReplicationTaskArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replication task.

              ReplicationTaskLastAssessmentDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the task assessment was completed.

              AssessmentStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the task assessment.

                 The task assessment results in JSON format.

                 The response object only contains this field if  you  provide
                 DescribeReplicationTaskAssessmentResultsMessage$Replication-
                 TaskArn in the request.

              S3ObjectUrl -> (string)
