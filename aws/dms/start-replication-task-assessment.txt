NAME
       start-replication-task-assessment -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  the  replication  task assessment for unsupported data types in
       the source database.

       You can only use this operation for a task if the following  conditions
       are true:

       o The task must be in the stopped state.

       o The task must have successful connections to the source and target.

       If either of these conditions are not met, an InvalidResourceStateFault
       error will result.

       For information about DMS task assessments, see Creating a task assess-
       ment report in the Database Migration Service User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-replication-task-assessment
          --replication-task-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --replication-task-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replication task.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun.html`__
                 is  an improved premigration task assessment operation. The `
                 StartReplicationTaskAssessment
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessment.html`__
                 operation assesses data type compatibility only  between  the
                 source and target database of a given migration task. In con-
                 trast,          `           StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun.html`__
                 enables you to specify a variety of premigration task assess-
                 ments  in  addition to data type compatibility. These assess-
                 ments include ones for the validity of  primary  key  defini-
                 tions  and likely issues with database migration performance,
                 among others.

          LastFailureMessage -> (string)
              The last error (failure) message generated for  the  replication
              task.

          StopReason -> (string)
              The  reason  the replication task was stopped. This response pa-
              rameter can return one of the following values:

              o "STOP_REASON_FULL_LOAD_COMPLETED"   Full-load  migration  com-
                pleted.

              o "STOP_REASON_CACHED_CHANGES_APPLIED"    Change   data  capture
                (CDC) load completed.

              o "STOP_REASON_CACHED_CHANGES_NOT_APPLIED"  In a  full-load  and
                CDC  migration,  the  full  load  stopped  as specified before
                starting the CDC migration.

              o "STOP_REASON_SERVER_TIME"  The migration stopped at the speci-
                fied server time.

          ReplicationTaskCreationDate -> (timestamp)
              The date the replication task was created.

          ReplicationTaskStartDate -> (timestamp)
              The date the replication task is scheduled to start.

          CdcStartPosition -> (string)
              Indicates when you want a change data capture (CDC) operation to
              start. Use either CdcStartPosition or  CdcStartTime  to  specify
              when you want the CDC operation to start. Specifying both values
              results in an error.

              The value can be in date, checkpoint, or LSN/SCN format.

              Date Example: --cdc-start-position 2018-03-08T12:12:12

              Checkpoint      Example:      --cdc-start-position       "check-
              point:V1#27#mysql-bin-changelog.157832:1975:-1:2002:677883278264080:mysql-bin-changelog.157832:1876#0#0#*#0#93"

              LSN Example: --cdc-start-position mysql-bin-changelog.000024:373

          CdcStopPosition -> (string)
              Indicates when you want a change data capture (CDC) operation to
              stop. The value can be either server time or commit time.

              Server         time         example:         --cdc-stop-position
              server_time:2018-02-09T12:12:12

          RecoveryCheckpoint -> (string)
              Indicates the last checkpoint that occurred during a change data
              capture (CDC) operation. You can provide this value to the  Cdc-
              StartPosition  parameter to start a CDC operation that begins at
              that checkpoint.

              data  for certain source and target endpoints. For more informa-
              tion, see Specifying Supplemental Data for Task Settings in  the
              Database Migration Service User Guide.

          TargetReplicationInstanceArn -> (string)
              The  ARN of the replication instance to which this task is moved
