NAME
       create-replication-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates the replication instance using the specified parameters.

       DMS requires that your account have certain roles with appropriate per-
       missions before you can create a replication instance. For  information
       on  the  required roles, see Creating the IAM Roles to Use With the CLI
       and DMS API . For information on the required permissions, see IAM Per-
       missions Needed to Use DMS .

OPTIONS
       --replication-instance-identifier (string)
          The  replication  instance identifier. This parameter is stored as a
          lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain 1-63 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.

          o First character must be a letter.

          o Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          Example: myrepinstance

       --allocated-storage (integer)
          The amount of storage (in gigabytes) to be initially  allocated  for
          the replication instance.

       --replication-instance-class (string)
          The  compute  and memory capacity of the replication instance as de-
          fined for the specified replication instance class. For  example  to
          specify  the  instance  class  dms.c4.large,  set  this parameter to
          "dms.c4.large" .

          For more information on the settings and capacities for  the  avail-
          able  replication  instance  classes,  see  Selecting  the right DMS
          replication instance for your migration .

       --vpc-security-group-ids (list)
          Specifies the VPC security group to be used with the replication in-
          stance. The VPC security group must work with the VPC containing the
          replication instance.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --availability-zone (string)
          The Availability Zone where the replication instance  will  be  cre-
          ated. The default value is a random, system-chosen Availability Zone
          in  the  endpoint's  Amazon  Web  Services  Region,   for   example:
          us-east-1d

       --replication-subnet-group-identifier (string)
          A subnet group to associate with the replication instance.

       --preferred-maintenance-window (string)
          The  weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur, in
          Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

          Format: ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi

          Default: A 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour  block
          of time per Amazon Web Services Region, occurring on a random day of
          the week.

          Valid Days: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun

          Constraints: Minimum 30-minute window.

       --multi-az | --no-multi-az (boolean)
          Specifies whether the replication instance is a Multi-AZ deployment.
          You can't set the AvailabilityZone parameter if the Multi-AZ parame-
          ter is set to true .

       --engine-version (string)
          The engine version number of the replication instance.

          If an engine version number is not specified when a replication  in-
          stance  is  created, the default is the latest engine version avail-
          able.

       --auto-minor-version-upgrade |  --no-auto-minor-version-upgrade  (bool-
       ean)
          A value that indicates whether minor engine upgrades are applied au-
          tomatically to the replication instance during the maintenance  win-
          dow. This parameter defaults to true .

          Default: true

          When  AutoMinorVersionUpgrade  is  enabled, DMS uses the current de-
          fault engine version when you create a replication instance. For ex-
          ample,  if  you set EngineVersion to a lower version number than the
          current default version, DMS uses the default version.

          If AutoMinorVersionUpgrade  isnt enabled when you create a  replica-
          tion instance, DMS uses the engine version specified by the EngineV-
          ersion parameter.

       --tags (list)
          One or more tags to be assigned to the replication instance.

          (structure)
              A user-defined key-value pair that describes metadata  added  to
              an  DMS resource and that is used by operations such as the fol-
              lowing:

              o AddTagsToResource

              o ListTagsForResource

              o RemoveTagsFromResource

              Key -> (string)
                 A key is the required name of the tag. The string  value  can
                 be  1-128  Unicode characters in length and can't be prefixed
                 with "aws:" or "dms:". The string can only contain  only  the
                 set  of  Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.', '/',
                 '=',     '+',     '-'     (Java     regular      expressions:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  is  the optional value of the tag. The string value
                 can be 1-256 Unicode characters in length and can't  be  pre-
                 fixed with "aws:" or "dms:". The string can only contain only
                 the set of Unicode letters, digits,  white-space,  '_',  '.',
                 '/',    '=',    '+',    '-'    (Java   regular   expressions:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) string that  uniquely  identi-
                 fies the resource for which the tag is created.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,ResourceArn=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "ResourceArn": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --kms-key-id (string)
          An KMS key identifier that is used to encrypt the data on the repli-
          cation instance.

          If you don't specify a value for the KmsKeyId  parameter,  then  DMS
          uses your default encryption key.

          KMS  creates the default encryption key for your Amazon Web Services
          account. Your Amazon Web Services account has  a  different  default
          encryption key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

       --publicly-accessible | --no-publicly-accessible (boolean)
          Specifies  the accessibility options for the replication instance. A
          value of true represents an instance with a  public  IP  address.  A
          value of false represents an instance with a private IP address. The
          default value is true .

       --dns-name-servers (string)
          A list of custom DNS name servers supported for the replication  in-
          stance  to  access  your  on-premise source or target database. This
          list overrides the default name servers supported by the replication
          instance.  You  can  specify  a comma-separated list of internet ad-
          dresses for up to four on-premise DNS  name  servers.  For  example:
          "1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2,3.3.3.3,4.4.4.4"

       --resource-identifier (string)
          A  friendly  name for the resource identifier at the end of the End-
          pointArn response parameter that is returned in the created Endpoint
          object.  The  value for this parameter can have up to 31 characters.
          It can contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphen  ('-').  Also,
          it  can't  end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens, and
          can only begin with a letter, such as Example-App-ARN1 .  For  exam-
          ple,   this   value   might   result   in   the   EndpointArn  value
          arn:aws:dms:eu-west-1:012345678901:rep:Example-App-ARN1  .  If   you
          don't  specify  a  ResourceIdentifier value, DMS generates a default
          identifier value for the end of EndpointArn .

       --network-type (string)
          The type of IP address protocol used by a replication instance, such
          as IPv4 only or Dual-stack that supports both IPv4 and IPv6 address-
          ing. IPv6 only is not yet supported.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a replication instance

       The following create-replication-instance example creates a replication
       instance.

          aws dms create-replication-instance \
              --replication-instance-identifier my-repl-instance \
