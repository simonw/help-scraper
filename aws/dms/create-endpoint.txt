CREATE-ENDPOINT()                                            CREATE-ENDPOINT()



NAME
       create-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an endpoint using the provided settings.

       NOTE:
          For  a MySQL source or target endpoint, don't explicitly specify the
          database using the DatabaseName request parameter on the  CreateEnd-
          point API call. Specifying DatabaseName when you create a MySQL end-
          point replicates all the task tables to this  single  database.  For
          MySQL  endpoints, you specify the database only when you specify the
          schema in the table-mapping rules of the DMS task.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --endpoint-identifier (string)
          The database endpoint identifier. Identifiers must begin with a let-
          ter  and  must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens. They
          can't end with a hyphen, or contain two consecutive hyphens.

       --endpoint-type (string)
          The type of endpoint. Valid values are source and target .

          Possible values:

          o source

          o target

       --engine-name (string)
          The type of engine for the endpoint. Valid values, depending on  the
          EndpointType value, include "mysql" , "oracle" , "postgres" , "mari-
          adb" , "aurora" , "aurora-postgresql" , "opensearch" , "redshift"  ,
          "s3"  , "db2" , "azuredb" , "sybase" , "dynamodb" , "mongodb" , "ki-
          nesis" , "kafka" , "elasticsearch" , "docdb"  ,  "sqlserver"  ,  and
          "neptune" .

       --username (string)
          The user name to be used to log in to the endpoint database.

       --password (string)
          The password to be used to log in to the endpoint database.

       --server-name (string)
          The name of the server where the endpoint database resides.

       --port (integer)
          The port used by the endpoint database.

       --database-name (string)
          The name of the endpoint database. For a MySQL source or target end-
          point, do not specify DatabaseName. To migrate to a  specific  data-
          base, use this setting and targetDbType .

       --extra-connection-attributes (string)
          Additional attributes associated with the connection. Each attribute
          is specified as a name-value pair associated by an equal  sign  (=).
          Multiple  attributes  are separated by a semicolon (;) with no addi-
          tional white space. For information on the attributes available  for
          connecting your source or target endpoint, see Working with DMS End-
          points in the Database Migration Service User Guide.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          An KMS key identifier that is used to encrypt the connection parame-
          ters for the endpoint.

          If  you  don't  specify a value for the KmsKeyId parameter, then DMS
          uses your default encryption key.

          KMS creates the default encryption key for your Amazon Web  Services
          account.  Your  Amazon  Web Services account has a different default
          encryption key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

       --tags (list)
          One or more tags to be assigned to the endpoint.

          (structure)
              A user-defined key-value pair that describes metadata  added  to
              an  DMS resource and that is used by operations such as the fol-
              lowing:

              o AddTagsToResource

              o ListTagsForResource

              o RemoveTagsFromResource

              Key -> (string)
                 A key is the required name of the tag. The string  value  can
                 be  1-128  Unicode characters in length and can't be prefixed
                 with "aws:" or "dms:". The string can only contain  only  the
                 set  of  Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.', '/',
                 '=',     '+',     '-'     (Java     regular      expressions:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  is  the optional value of the tag. The string value
                 can be 1-256 Unicode characters in length and can't  be  pre-
                 fixed with "aws:" or "dms:". The string can only contain only
                 the set of Unicode letters, digits,  white-space,  '_',  '.',
                 '/',    '=',    '+',    '-'    (Java   regular   expressions:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) string that  uniquely  identi-
                 fies the resource for which the tag is created.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,ResourceArn=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {

              "ResourceArn": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

          o none

          o require

          o verify-ca

          o verify-full

       --service-access-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the service access role that  you
          want  to  use  to  create  the  endpoint.  The  role  must allow the
          iam:PassRole action.

       --external-table-definition (string)
          The external table definition.

       --dynamo-db-settings (structure)
          Settings in JSON format for the target Amazon DynamoDB endpoint. For
          information about other available settings, see Using Object Mapping
          to Migrate Data to DynamoDB in the Database Migration  Service  User
          Guide.

          ServiceAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) used by the service to access the
              IAM role. The role must allow the iam:PassRole action.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ServiceAccessRoleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ServiceAccessRoleArn": "string"
          }

       --s3-settings (structure)
          Settings in JSON format for the target Amazon S3 endpoint. For  more
          information  about  the available settings, see Extra Connection At-
          tributes When Using Amazon S3 as a Target for DMS  in  the  Database
          Migration Service User Guide.

          ServiceAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) used by the service to access the
              IAM role. The role must allow the iam:PassRole action. It  is  a
              required  parameter  that  enables DMS to write and read objects
              from an S3 bucket.

          ExternalTableDefinition -> (string)
              Specifies how tables are defined in the S3 source files only.

          CsvRowDelimiter -> (string)
              The delimiter used to separate rows in the .csv  file  for  both
              source and target. The default is a carriage return (\n ).

          CsvDelimiter -> (string)
              The delimiter used to separate columns in the .csv file for both
              source and target. The default is a comma.

          BucketFolder -> (string)
              An optional parameter to set a folder name in the S3 bucket.  If
              provided,  tables  are  created  in  the  path  ``  bucketFolder
              /schema_name /table_name /`` . If this  parameter  isn't  speci-
              fied, then the path used is `` schema_name /table_name /`` .

          BucketName -> (string)
              The name of the S3 bucket.

          CompressionType -> (string)
              An  optional parameter to use GZIP to compress the target files.
              Set to GZIP to compress the target files. Either set this param-
              eter  to  NONE  (the default) or don't use it to leave the files
              uncompressed. This parameter applies to both .csv  and  .parquet
              file formats.

          EncryptionMode -> (string)
              The type of server-side encryption that you want to use for your
              data. This encryption type is part of the endpoint  settings  or
              the  extra  connections attributes for Amazon S3. You can choose
              either SSE_S3 (the default) or SSE_KMS .

              NOTE:
                 For the ModifyEndpoint operation, you can change the existing
                 value  of the EncryptionMode parameter from SSE_KMS to SSE_S3
                 . But you cant change  the  existing  value  from  SSE_S3  to
                 SSE_KMS .

              To use SSE_S3 , you need an Identity and Access Management (IAM)
              role with permission to allow "arn:aws:s3:::dms-*"  to  use  the
              following actions:

              o s3:CreateBucket

              o s3:ListBucket

              o s3:DeleteBucket

              o s3:GetBucketLocation

              o s3:GetObject

              o s3:PutObject

              o s3:DeleteObject

              o s3:GetObjectVersion

              o s3:GetBucketPolicy

              o s3:PutBucketPolicy

              o s3:DeleteBucketPolicy

          ServerSideEncryptionKmsKeyId -> (string)
              If  you  are  using SSE_KMS for the EncryptionMode , provide the
              KMS key ID. The key that you use needs an attached  policy  that
              enables  Identity  and  Access Management (IAM) user permissions
              and allows use of the key.

              Here is a CLI example:
              ``
              aws  dms  create-endpoint  --endpoint-identifier  value   --end-
              point-type  target --engine-name s3 --s3-settings ServiceAccess-
              RoleArn=*value* ,BucketFolder=*value*  ,BucketName=*value*  ,En-
              cryptionMode=SSE_KMS,ServerSideEncryptionKmsKeyId=*value* ``

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 470)
                     Inline literal start-string without end-string.

          DataFormat -> (string)
              The  format of the data that you want to use for output. You can
              choose one of the following:

              o csv : This is a row-based  file  format  with  comma-separated
                values (.csv).

              o parquet : Apache Parquet (.parquet) is a columnar storage file
                format that features efficient compression and provides faster
                query response.

          EncodingType -> (string)
              The type of encoding you are using:

              o RLE_DICTIONARY   uses   a   combination   of  bit-packing  and
                run-length encoding to store repeated values more efficiently.
                This is the default.

              o PLAIN  doesn't  use encoding at all. Values are stored as they
                are.

              o PLAIN_DICTIONARY builds a dictionary of the values encountered
                in  a  given  column. The dictionary is stored in a dictionary
                page for each column chunk.

          DictPageSizeLimit -> (integer)
              The maximum size of an encoded dictionary page of a  column.  If
              the dictionary page exceeds this, this column is stored using an
              encoding type of PLAIN . This parameter defaults to 1024 *  1024
              bytes  (1  MiB), the maximum size of a dictionary page before it
              reverts to PLAIN encoding. This size is used for  .parquet  file
              format only.

          RowGroupLength -> (integer)
              The number of rows in a row group. A smaller row group size pro-
              vides faster reads. But as the number of row groups  grows,  the
              slower  writes  become.  This parameter defaults to 10,000 rows.
              This number is used for .parquet file format only.

              If you choose a value larger than the maximum, RowGroupLength is
              set to the max row group length in bytes (64 * 1024 * 1024).

          DataPageSize -> (integer)
              The  size  of one data page in bytes. This parameter defaults to
              1024 * 1024 bytes (1 MiB). This number is used for .parquet file
              format only.

          ParquetVersion -> (string)
              The  version  of the Apache Parquet format that you want to use:
              parquet_1_0 (the default) or parquet_2_0 .

          EnableStatistics -> (boolean)
              A value that  enables  statistics  for  Parquet  pages  and  row
              groups. Choose true to enable statistics, false to disable. Sta-
              tistics include NULL , DISTINCT , MAX , and MIN values. This pa-
              rameter  defaults to true . This value is used for .parquet file
              format only.

          IncludeOpForFullLoad -> (boolean)
              A value that enables a full load to write INSERT  operations  to
              the  comma-separated  value (.csv) output files only to indicate
              how the rows were added to the source database.

              NOTE:
                 DMS supports the IncludeOpForFullLoad parameter  in  versions
                 3.1.4 and later.

              For  full  load,  records  can only be inserted. By default (the
              false setting), no information is recorded in these output files
              for  a  full load to indicate that the rows were inserted at the
              source database. If IncludeOpForFullLoad is set to true or  y  ,
              the  INSERT is recorded as an I annotation in the first field of
              the .csv file. This allows the format  of  your  target  records
              from a full load to be consistent with the target records from a
              CDC load.

              NOTE:
                 This setting works together with the CdcInsertsOnly  and  the
                 CdcInsertsAndUpdates  parameters  for  output  to  .csv files
                 only. For more information about how these settings work  to-
                 gether,  see  Indicating  Source DB Operations in Migrated S3
                 Data in the Database Migration Service User Guide. .

          CdcInsertsOnly -> (boolean)
              A value that enables a change data capture (CDC) load  to  write
              only  INSERT  operations  to .csv or columnar storage (.parquet)
              output files. By default (the false setting), the first field in
              a .csv or .parquet record contains the letter I (INSERT), U (UP-
              DATE), or D (DELETE). These values indicate whether the row  was
              inserted,  updated,  or deleted at the source database for a CDC
              load to the target.

              If CdcInsertsOnly is set to true or y , only  INSERTs  from  the
              source  database  are migrated to the .csv or .parquet file. For
              .csv format only, how these INSERTs are recorded depends on  the
              value  of  IncludeOpForFullLoad . If IncludeOpForFullLoad is set
              to true , the first field of every CDC record is set to I to in-
              dicate  the INSERT operation at the source. If IncludeOpForFull-
              Load is set to false , every CDC record  is  written  without  a
              first  field to indicate the INSERT operation at the source. For
              more information about how these  settings  work  together,  see
              Indicating Source DB Operations in Migrated S3 Data in the Data-
              base Migration Service User Guide. .

              NOTE:
                 DMS supports the interaction described preceding between  the
                 CdcInsertsOnly  and  IncludeOpForFullLoad  parameters in ver-
                 sions 3.1.4 and later.
                     CdcInsertsOnly and CdcInsertsAndUpdates can't both be set
                     to  true for the same endpoint. Set either CdcInsertsOnly
                     or CdcInsertsAndUpdates to true for  the  same  endpoint,
                     but not both.

          TimestampColumnName -> (string)
              A value that when nonblank causes DMS to add a column with time-
              stamp information to the endpoint data for an Amazon S3 target.

              NOTE:
                 DMS supports the TimestampColumnName  parameter  in  versions
                 3.1.4 and later.

              DMS includes an additional STRING column in the .csv or .parquet
              object files of your migrated data when you set TimestampColumn-
              Name to a nonblank value.

              For  a  full  load, each row of this timestamp column contains a
              timestamp for when the data was transferred from the  source  to
              the target by DMS.

              For  a change data capture (CDC) load, each row of the timestamp
              column contains the timestamp for the commit of that row in  the
              source database.

              The  string format for this timestamp column value is yyyy-MM-dd
              HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS . By default, the precision of this value is  in
              microseconds.  For a CDC load, the rounding of the precision de-
              pends on the commit timestamp supported by DMS  for  the  source
              database.

              When  the  AddColumnName parameter is set to true , DMS also in-
              cludes a name for the timestamp column that you set with  Times-
              tampColumnName .

          ParquetTimestampInMillisecond -> (boolean)
              A  value  that  specifies  the precision of any TIMESTAMP column
              values that are written to an Amazon S3 object file in  .parquet
              format.

              NOTE:
                 DMS  supports  the ParquetTimestampInMillisecond parameter in
                 versions 3.1.4 and later.

              When ParquetTimestampInMillisecond is set to true  or  y  ,  DMS
              writes  all  TIMESTAMP columns in a .parquet formatted file with
              millisecond precision. Otherwise, DMS writes them with microsec-
              ond precision.

              Currently,  Amazon  Athena  and Glue can handle only millisecond
              precision for TIMESTAMP values. Set this parameter to  true  for
              S3 endpoint object files that are .parquet formatted only if you
              plan to query or process the data with Athena or Glue.

              NOTE:
                 DMS writes any TIMESTAMP column values written to an S3  file
                 in .csv format with microsecond precision.

                 Setting  ParquetTimestampInMillisecond  has  no effect on the
                 string format of the timestamp column value that is  inserted
                 by setting the TimestampColumnName parameter.

          CdcInsertsAndUpdates -> (boolean)
              A  value  that enables a change data capture (CDC) load to write
              INSERT and UPDATE operations to .csv or .parquet (columnar stor-
              age)  output  files. The default setting is false , but when Cd-
              cInsertsAndUpdates is set to true or y , only  INSERTs  and  UP-
              DATEs from the source database are migrated to the .csv or .par-
              quet file.

              For .csv file format only, how these  INSERTs  and  UPDATEs  are
              recorded depends on the value of the IncludeOpForFullLoad param-
              eter. If IncludeOpForFullLoad is set to true , the  first  field
              of  every  CDC record is set to either I or U to indicate INSERT
              and UPDATE operations at the source. But if IncludeOpForFullLoad
              is  set to false , CDC records are written without an indication
              of INSERT or UPDATE operations at the source. For more  informa-
              tion  about  how  these  settings  work together, see Indicating
              Source DB Operations in Migrated S3 Data in the Database  Migra-
              tion Service User Guide. .

              NOTE:
                 DMS supports the use of the CdcInsertsAndUpdates parameter in
                 versions 3.3.1 and later.
                     CdcInsertsOnly and CdcInsertsAndUpdates can't both be set
                     to  true for the same endpoint. Set either CdcInsertsOnly
                     or CdcInsertsAndUpdates to true for  the  same  endpoint,
                     but not both.

          DatePartitionEnabled -> (boolean)
              When  set  to true , this parameter partitions S3 bucket folders
              based on transaction commit dates. The default value is false  .
              For  more  information about date-based folder partitioning, see
              Using date-based folder partitioning .

          DatePartitionSequence -> (string)
              Identifies the sequence of the date format to use during  folder
              partitioning. The default value is YYYYMMDD . Use this parameter
              when DatePartitionedEnabled is set to true .

          DatePartitionDelimiter -> (string)
              Specifies a date separating delimiter to use during folder  par-
              titioning.  The default value is SLASH . Use this parameter when
              DatePartitionedEnabled is set to true .

          UseCsvNoSupValue -> (boolean)
              This setting applies if the S3 output files during a change data
              capture  (CDC)  load  are written in .csv format. If set to true
              for columns not included in the supplemental log, DMS  uses  the
              value         specified         by        `        CsvNoSupValue
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_S3Settings.html#DMS-Type-S3Settings-CsvNoSupValue`__
              . If not set or set to false , DMS uses the null value for these
              columns.

              NOTE:
                 This setting is supported in DMS versions 3.4.1 and later.

          CsvNoSupValue -> (string)
              This setting only applies if your Amazon S3 output files  during
              a  change data capture (CDC) load are written in .csv format. If
              `                                               UseCsvNoSupValue
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_S3Settings.html#DMS-Type-S3Settings-UseCsvNoSupValue`__
              is set to true, specify a string value that you want DMS to  use
              for  all columns not included in the supplemental log. If you do
              not specify a string value, DMS uses the null  value  for  these
              columns regardless of the UseCsvNoSupValue setting.

              NOTE:
                 This setting is supported in DMS versions 3.4.1 and later.

          PreserveTransactions -> (boolean)
              If  set  to  true , DMS saves the transaction order for a change
              data capture (CDC) load on the Amazon S3 target specified  by  `
              CdcPath
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_S3Settings.html#DMS-Type-S3Settings-CdcPath`__
              . For more information, see Capturing data changes (CDC) includ-
              ing transaction order on the S3 target .

              NOTE:
                 This setting is supported in DMS versions 3.4.2 and later.

          CdcPath -> (string)
              Specifies the folder path of CDC files. For an S3  source,  this
              setting  is  required if a task captures change data; otherwise,
              it's optional. If CdcPath is set, DMS reads CDC files from  this
              path and replicates the data changes to the target endpoint. For
              an   S3   target   if    you    set    `    PreserveTransactions
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_S3Settings.html#DMS-Type-S3Settings-PreserveTransactions`__
              to true , DMS verifies that you have set  this  parameter  to  a
              folder path on your S3 target where DMS can save the transaction
              order for the CDC load. DMS creates this CDC folder path in  ei-
              ther  your S3 target working directory or the S3 target location
              specified             by             `              BucketFolder
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_S3Settings.html#DMS-Type-S3Settings-BucketFolder`__
              and                         `                         BucketName
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_S3Settings.html#DMS-Type-S3Settings-BucketName`__
              .

              For example, if you specify CdcPath as MyChangedData ,  and  you
              specify  BucketName as MyTargetBucket but do not specify Bucket-
              Folder , DMS creates the CDC folder  path  following:  MyTarget-
              Bucket/MyChangedData .

              If  you specify the same CdcPath , and you specify BucketName as
              MyTargetBucket and BucketFolder as MyTargetData  ,  DMS  creates
              the  CDC  folder path following: MyTargetBucket/MyTargetData/My-
              ChangedData .

              For more information on CDC including transaction order on an S3
              target,  see  Capturing data changes (CDC) including transaction
              order on the S3 target .

              NOTE:
                 This setting is supported in DMS versions 3.4.2 and later.

          UseTaskStartTimeForFullLoadTimestamp -> (boolean)
              When set to true, this parameter uses the task start time as the
              timestamp  column  value  instead of the time data is written to
              target. For full load, when useTaskStartTimeForFullLoadTimestamp
              is  set  to true , each row of the timestamp column contains the
              task start time. For CDC loads, each row of the timestamp column
              contains the transaction commit time.

              When  useTaskStartTimeForFullLoadTimestamp is set to false , the
              full load timestamp in the timestamp column increments with  the
              time data arrives at the target.

          CannedAclForObjects -> (string)
              A value that enables DMS to specify a predefined (canned) access
              control list for objects created in an Amazon S3 bucket as  .csv
              or  .parquet  files. For more information about Amazon S3 canned
              ACLs, see Canned ACL in the Amazon S3 Developer Guide.

              The default value is NONE. Valid values include  NONE,  PRIVATE,
              PUBLIC_READ,        PUBLIC_READ_WRITE,       AUTHENTICATED_READ,
              AWS_EXEC_READ, BUCKET_OWNER_READ, and BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL.

          AddColumnName -> (boolean)
              An optional parameter that, when set to true or y , you can  use
              to add column name information to the .csv output file.

              The default value is false . Valid values are true , false , y ,
              and n .

          CdcMaxBatchInterval -> (integer)
              Maximum length of the interval, defined in seconds, after  which
              to output a file to Amazon S3.

              When  CdcMaxBatchInterval and CdcMinFileSize are both specified,
              the file write is triggered by whichever parameter condition  is
              met first within an DMS CloudFormation template.

              The default value is 60 seconds.

          CdcMinFileSize -> (integer)
              Minimum  file  size,  defined  in megabytes, to reach for a file
              output to Amazon S3.

              When CdcMinFileSize and CdcMaxBatchInterval are both  specified,
              the  file write is triggered by whichever parameter condition is
              met first within an DMS CloudFormation template.

              The default value is 32 MB.

          CsvNullValue -> (string)
              An optional parameter that specifies how DMS treats null values.
              While  handling  the  null  value, you can use this parameter to
              pass a user-defined string as null when writing to  the  target.
              For  example,  when target columns are not nullable, you can use
              this option to differentiate between the empty string value  and
              the null value. So, if you set this parameter value to the empty
              string ("" or ''), DMS treats the empty string as the null value
              instead of NULL .

              The  default  value  is  NULL  .  Valid values include any valid
              string.

          IgnoreHeaderRows -> (integer)
              When this value is set to 1, DMS ignores the first row header in
              a  .csv  file.  A  value of 1 turns on the feature; a value of 0
              turns off the feature.

              The default is 0.

          MaxFileSize -> (integer)
              A value that specifies the maximum size (in KB) of any .csv file
              to be created while migrating to an S3 target during full load.

              The default value is 1,048,576 KB (1 GB). Valid values include 1
              to 1,048,576.

          Rfc4180 -> (boolean)
              For an S3 source, when this value is set to true  or  y  ,  each
              leading  double  quotation  mark has to be followed by an ending
              double quotation mark. This formatting complies with  RFC  4180.
              When  this  value  is  set  to  false or n , string literals are
              copied to the target as is. In this case, a  delimiter  (row  or
              column)  signals the end of the field. Thus, you can't use a de-
              limiter as part of the string, because it signals the end of the
              value.

              For  an S3 target, an optional parameter used to set behavior to
              comply with RFC 4180 for data migrated to Amazon S3  using  .csv
              file format only. When this value is set to true or y using Ama-
              zon S3 as a target, if the data has quotation marks  or  newline
              characters  in  it, DMS encloses the entire column with an addi-
              tional pair of double quotation marks ("). Every quotation  mark
              within the data is repeated twice.

              The  default value is true . Valid values include true , false ,
              y , and n .

          DatePartitionTimezone -> (string)
              When creating an S3 target endpoint,  set  DatePartitionTimezone
              to  convert the current UTC time into a specified time zone. The
              conversion occurs when a date partition folder is created and  a
              CDC  filename  is  generated. The time zone format is Area/Loca-
              tion. Use this parameter when DatePartitionedEnabled is  set  to
              true , as shown in the following example.
                 s3-settings='{"DatePartitionEnabled": true, "DatePartitionSe-
                 quence":  "YYYYMMDDHH",  "DatePartitionDelimiter":   "SLASH",
                 "DatePartitionTimezone":"*Asia/Seoul*     ",    "BucketName":
                 "dms-nattarat-test"}'

          AddTrailingPaddingCharacter -> (boolean)
              Use the S3 target endpoint  setting  AddTrailingPaddingCharacter
              to add padding on string data. The default value is false .

          ExpectedBucketOwner -> (string)
              To  specify  a bucket owner and prevent sniping, you can use the
              ExpectedBucketOwner endpoint setting.

              Example:    --s3-settings='{"ExpectedBucketOwner":     "*AWS_Ac-
              count_ID* "}'

              When you make a request to test a connection or perform a migra-
              tion, S3 checks the account ID of the bucket owner  against  the
              specified parameter.

       --dms-transfer-settings (structure)
          The settings in JSON format for the DMS transfer type of source end-
          point.

          Possible settings include the following:

          o ServiceAccessRoleArn - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) used by  the
            service  access IAM role. The role must allow the iam:PassRole ac-

              the replication instance. If you don't specify a value  for  the
              KmsKeyId  parameter,  then DMS uses your default encryption key.
              KMS creates the default encryption key for your Amazon Web  Ser-
              vices  account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different
              default encryption key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

              sions to access the value in  SecretsManagerSecret  .  The  role
              must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret has the
              value of the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager secret that al-
              lows access to the MongoDB endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 You  can  specify one of two sets of values for these permis-
                 sions. You can specify the values for this  setting  and  Se-
                 cretsManagerSecretId  .  Or you can specify clear-text values
                 for UserName , Password , ServerName , and Port .  You  can't
                 specify  both. For more information on creating this Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret and  the  SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn  and  Se-
                 cretsManagerSecretId required to access it, see Using secrets
                 to access Database Migration Service resources in  the  Data-

          Database Migration Service User Guide.

          StreamArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  for  the  Amazon  Kinesis  Data
              Streams endpoint.

              The  output  format for the records created on the endpoint. The
              message format is JSON (default) or JSON_UNFORMATTED  (a  single
              line with no tab).

          ServiceAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the IAM role that DMS uses to
              write to the Kinesis  data  stream.  The  role  must  allow  the
              iam:PassRole action.

          IncludeTransactionDetails -> (boolean)
              Provides  detailed transaction information from the source data-
              base. This information includes a commit timestamp, a log  posi-
              tion,  and values for transaction_id , previous transaction_id ,
              and transaction_record_id (the record offset within  a  transac-
              tion). The default is false .

          IncludePartitionValue -> (boolean)
              Shows the partition value within the Kinesis message output, un-
              less the partition type is schema-table-type .  The  default  is
              false .

          PartitionIncludeSchemaTable -> (boolean)
              Prefixes  schema  and  table names to partition values, when the
              partition type is primary-key-type . Doing this  increases  data
              distribution  among  Kinesis shards. For example, suppose that a
              SysBench schema has thousands of tables and each table has  only
              limited  range for a primary key. In this case, the same primary
              key is sent from thousands of tables to the  same  shard,  which
              causes throttling. The default is false .

          IncludeTableAlterOperations -> (boolean)
              Includes  any  data  definition  language  (DDL) operations that
              change the table in the control data,  such  as  rename-table  ,
              drop-table  , add-column , drop-column , and rename-column . The
              default is false .

          IncludeControlDetails -> (boolean)
              Shows detailed control information for table definition,  column
              definition,  and table and column changes in the Kinesis message
              output. The default is false .

          IncludeNullAndEmpty -> (boolean)
              Include NULL and empty columns for records migrated to the  end-
              point. The default is false .

          NoHexPrefix -> (boolean)
              Set  this optional parameter to true to avoid adding a '0x' pre-
              fix to raw data in hexadecimal format. For example, by  default,
              DMS  adds  a  '0x'  prefix to the LOB column type in hexadecimal
              format moving from an Oracle source to an Amazon Kinesis target.
              Use  the NoHexPrefix endpoint setting to enable migration of RAW
              data type columns without adding the '0x' prefix.

          }

       --kafka-settings (structure)
          Settings in JSON format for the target Apache  Kafka  endpoint.  For
          more information about the available settings, see Using object map-
          ping to migrate data to a Kafka topic in the Database Migration Ser-
          vice User Guide.

          Broker -> (string)
              A  comma-separated  list of one or more broker locations in your
              Kafka cluster that host your Kafka instance. Specify each broker

              topic.

          MessageFormat -> (string)
              The  output  format for the records created on the endpoint. The
              message format is JSON (default) or JSON_UNFORMATTED  (a  single

              SysBench  schema has thousands of tables and each table has only
              limited range for a primary key. In this case, the same  primary
              key  is  sent  from  thousands  of tables to the same partition,
              which causes throttling. The default is false .

          IncludeTableAlterOperations -> (boolean)
              Includes any data  definition  language  (DDL)  operations  that
              change  the  table  in  the control data, such as rename-table ,
              drop-table , add-column , drop-column , and rename-column .  The

              Shows  detailed control information for table definition, column
              definition, and table and column changes in  the  Kafka  message
              output. The default is false .

              nection between server and client using SASL-SSL authentication.

          NoHexPrefix -> (boolean)
              Set  this optional parameter to true to avoid adding a '0x' pre-

              To avoid early failure, this counter  is  only  effective  after
              1000 records are transferred. OpenSearch also has the concept of
              error monitoring during the last 10 minutes  of  an  Observation
              Window.  If transfer of all records fail in the last 10 minutes,

              data before storing it in these .csv files.

          S3BucketFolder -> (string)
              A folder path where you want DMS to store migrated graph data in
              the S3 bucket specified by S3BucketName

          ErrorRetryDuration -> (integer)
              The  number of milliseconds for DMS to wait to retry a bulk-load
              of migrated graph data to the  Neptune  target  database  before
              raising an error. The default is 250.

          MaxFileSize -> (integer)
              The maximum size in kilobytes of migrated graph data stored in a
              .csv file before DMS bulk-loads the data to the  Neptune  target
              database.  The default is 1,048,576 KB. If the bulk load is suc-
              cessful, DMS clears the bucket, ready to store the next batch of
              migrated graph data.

          MaxRetryCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of  times  for DMS to retry a bulk load of migrated
              graph data to the Neptune target database before raising an  er-
              ror. The default is 5.

          IamAuthEnabled -> (boolean)
              If  you  want Identity and Access Management (IAM) authorization
              enabled for this endpoint, set this parameter to true . Then at-
              tach  the  appropriate  IAM policy document to your service role
              specified by ServiceAccessRoleArn . The default is false .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ServiceAccessRoleArn=string,S3BucketName=string,S3BucketFolder=string,ErrorRetryDuration=integer,MaxFileSize=integer,MaxRetryCount=integer,IamAuthEnabled=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ServiceAccessRoleArn": "string",
            "S3BucketName": "string",
            "S3BucketFolder": "string",
            "ErrorRetryDuration": integer,
            "MaxFileSize": integer,

          }

       --redshift-settings (structure)
          Provides information that defines an Amazon Redshift endpoint.

          AcceptAnyDate -> (boolean)
              A value that indicates to allow any date format,  including  in-
              valid  formats  such  as 00/00/00 00:00:00, to be loaded without
              generating an error. You can choose true or false (the default).

              This parameter applies only to TIMESTAMP and DATE  columns.  Al-
              ways  use  ACCEPTANYDATE  with  the DATEFORMAT parameter. If the
              date format for the data doesn't match the DATEFORMAT specifica-
              tion, Amazon Redshift inserts a NULL value into that field.

          AfterConnectScript -> (string)
              Code  to run after connecting. This parameter should contain the
              code itself, not the name of a file containing the code.

          BucketFolder -> (string)
              An S3 folder where the comma-separated-value  (.csv)  files  are
              stored before being uploaded to the target Redshift cluster.

              For  full load mode, DMS converts source records into .csv files
              and loads them to the BucketFolder/TableID path.  DMS  uses  the
              Redshift COPY command to upload the .csv files to the target ta-
              ble. The files are deleted once the COPY operation has finished.
              For  more  information, see COPY in the Amazon Redshift Database
              Developer Guide .

              For change-data-capture (CDC) mode, DMS creates a NetChanges ta-
              ble,    and    loads    the   .csv   files   to   this   Bucket-
              Folder/NetChangesTableID path.

          BucketName -> (string)
              The name of the intermediate S3 bucket used to store .csv  files
              before uploading data to Redshift.

          CaseSensitiveNames -> (boolean)
              If  Amazon  Redshift  is  configured  to  support case sensitive
              schema names, set CaseSensitiveNames to true .  The  default  is
              false .

          CompUpdate -> (boolean)
              If  you set CompUpdate to true Amazon Redshift applies automatic
              compression if the table is empty. This applies even if the  ta-
              ble  columns  already have encodings other than RAW . If you set
              CompUpdate to false , automatic compression is disabled and  ex-
              isting column encodings aren't changed. The default is true .

          ConnectionTimeout -> (integer)
              A  value  that sets the amount of time to wait (in milliseconds)
              before timing out, beginning from when you initially establish a
              connection.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              The  name  of  the Amazon Redshift data warehouse (service) that
              you are working with.

          DateFormat -> (string)
              The date format that  you  are  using.  Valid  values  are  auto
              (case-sensitive), your date format string enclosed in quotes, or
              NULL. If this parameter is left unset (NULL), it defaults  to  a
              format of 'YYYY-MM-DD'. Using auto recognizes most strings, even
              some that aren't supported when you use a date format string.

              If your date and time values use  formats  different  from  each
              other, set this to auto .

          EmptyAsNull -> (boolean)
              A value that specifies whether DMS should migrate empty CHAR and
              VARCHAR fields as NULL. A value of true sets empty CHAR and VAR-
              CHAR fields to null. The default is false .

          EncryptionMode -> (string)
              The type of server-side encryption that you want to use for your
              data. This encryption type is part of the endpoint  settings  or
              the  extra  connections attributes for Amazon S3. You can choose
              either SSE_S3 (the default) or SSE_KMS .

              NOTE:
                 For the ModifyEndpoint operation, you can change the existing
                 value  of the EncryptionMode parameter from SSE_KMS to SSE_S3
                 . But you cant change  the  existing  value  from  SSE_S3  to
                 SSE_KMS .

              To  use  SSE_S3 , create an Identity and Access Management (IAM)
              role with a policy that allows "arn:aws:s3:::*" to use the  fol-
              lowing actions: "s3:PutObject", "s3:ListBucket"

          ExplicitIds -> (boolean)
              This  setting  is only valid for a full-load migration task. Set
              ExplicitIds to true to have tables with IDENTITY  columns  over-
              ride  their  auto-generated  values  with explicit values loaded
              from the source data files used to populate the tables. The  de-
              fault is false .

          FileTransferUploadStreams -> (integer)
              The number of threads used to upload a single file. This parame-
              ter accepts a value from 1 through 64. It defaults to 10.

              The number of parallel streams used to upload a single .csv file
              to an S3 bucket using S3 Multipart Upload. For more information,
              see Multipart upload overview .
                 FileTransferUploadStreams accepts a value from 1 through  64.
                 It defaults to 10.

          LoadTimeout -> (integer)
              The  amount  of time to wait (in milliseconds) before timing out
              of operations performed by DMS on a Redshift  cluster,  such  as
              Redshift COPY, INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE.

          MaxFileSize -> (integer)
              The  maximum  size (in KB) of any .csv file used to load data on
              an S3 bucket and transfer data to Amazon Redshift.  It  defaults
              to 1048576KB (1 GB).

          Password -> (string)
              The password for the user named in the username property.

          Port -> (integer)
              The port number for Amazon Redshift. The default value is 5439.

          RemoveQuotes -> (boolean)
              A  value  that  specifies  to remove surrounding quotation marks
              from strings in the incoming data.  All  characters  within  the
              quotation marks, including delimiters, are retained. Choose true
              to remove quotation marks. The default is false .

          ReplaceInvalidChars -> (string)
              A list of characters that you want  to  replace.  Use  with  Re-
              placeChars .

          ReplaceChars -> (string)
              A value that specifies to replaces the invalid characters speci-
              fied in ReplaceInvalidChars , substituting the specified charac-
              ters instead. The default is "?" .

          ServerName -> (string)
              The name of the Amazon Redshift cluster you are using.

          ServiceAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that has access
              to  the  Amazon  Redshift  service.  The  role  must  allow  the
              iam:PassRole action.

          ServerSideEncryptionKmsKeyId -> (string)
              The  KMS key ID. If you are using SSE_KMS for the EncryptionMode
              , provide this key ID. The key that you use  needs  an  attached
              policy  that  enables IAM user permissions and allows use of the
              key.

          TimeFormat -> (string)
              The time format that you want to  use.  Valid  values  are  auto
              (case-sensitive),   'timeformat_string'   ,   'epochsecs'  ,  or
              'epochmillisecs' . It defaults to 10. Using auto recognizes most
              strings,  even  some  that  aren't supported when you use a time
              format string.

              If your date and time values use  formats  different  from  each
              other, set this parameter to auto .

          TrimBlanks -> (boolean)
              A  value that specifies to remove the trailing white space char-
              acters from a VARCHAR string. This  parameter  applies  only  to
              columns with a VARCHAR data type. Choose true to remove unneeded
              white space. The default is false .

          TruncateColumns -> (boolean)
              A value that specifies to truncate data in columns to the appro-
              priate  number  of characters, so that the data fits in the col-
              umn. This parameter applies only to columns with  a  VARCHAR  or
              CHAR  data  type,  and  rows with a size of 4 MB or less. Choose
              true to truncate data. The default is false .

          Username -> (string)
              An Amazon Redshift user name for a registered user.

          WriteBufferSize -> (integer)
              The size (in KB) of the in-memory file write  buffer  used  when
              generating  .csv  files on the local disk at the DMS replication
              instance. The default value is 1000 (buffer size is 1000KB).

          SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that  speci-
              fies  DMS  as the trusted entity and grants the required permis-
              sions to access the value in  SecretsManagerSecret  .  The  role
              must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret has the
              value of the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager secret that al-
              lows access to the Amazon Redshift endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 You  can  specify one of two sets of values for these permis-
                 sions. You can specify the values for this  setting  and  Se-
                 cretsManagerSecretId  .  Or you can specify clear-text values
                 for UserName , Password , ServerName , and Port .  You  can't
                 specify  both. For more information on creating this Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret and  the  SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn  and  Se-
                 cretsManagerSecretId required to access it, see Using secrets
                 to access Database Migration Service resources in  the  Data-
                 base Migration Service User Guide .

          SecretsManagerSecretId -> (string)
              The  full  ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of the SecretsMan-
              agerSecret that contains the Amazon Redshift endpoint connection
              details.

       --postgre-sql-settings (structure)
          Settings  in  JSON  format for the source and target PostgreSQL end-
          point. For information about other  available  settings,  see  Extra
          connection  attributes when using PostgreSQL as a source for DMS and
          Extra connection attributes when using PostgreSQL as  a  target  for
          DMS in the Database Migration Service User Guide.

          AfterConnectScript -> (string)
              For  use with change data capture (CDC) only, this attribute has
              DMS bypass foreign keys and user triggers to reduce the time  it
              takes to bulk load data.

              Example:         afterConnectScript=SET         session_replica-
              tion_role='replica'

          CaptureDdls -> (boolean)
              To capture DDL events, DMS  creates  various  artifacts  in  the
              PostgreSQL  database  when the task starts. You can later remove
              these artifacts.

              If this value is set to N , you don't have to create  tables  or
              triggers on the source database.

          MaxFileSize -> (integer)
              Specifies  the  maximum  size  (in  KB) of any .csv file used to
              transfer data to PostgreSQL.

              Example: maxFileSize=512

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              Database name for the endpoint.

          DdlArtifactsSchema -> (string)
              The schema in which the operational DDL database  artifacts  are
              created.

              Example: ddlArtifactsSchema=xyzddlschema;

          ExecuteTimeout -> (integer)
              Sets  the  client statement timeout for the PostgreSQL instance,
              in seconds. The default value is 60 seconds.

              Example: executeTimeout=100;

          FailTasksOnLobTruncation -> (boolean)
              When set to true , this value causes a task to fail if  the  ac-
              tual  size of a LOB column is greater than the specified LobMax-
              Size .

              If task is set to Limited LOB mode and this  option  is  set  to
              true, the task fails instead of truncating the LOB data.

          HeartbeatEnable -> (boolean)
              The  write-ahead  log  (WAL)  heartbeat  feature  mimics a dummy
              transaction. By doing this, it prevents idle logical replication
              slots  from holding onto old WAL logs, which can result in stor-
              age  full  situations  on  the  source.  This  heartbeat   keeps
              restart_lsn moving and prevents storage full scenarios.

          HeartbeatSchema -> (string)
              Sets the schema in which the heartbeat artifacts are created.

          HeartbeatFrequency -> (integer)
              Sets the WAL heartbeat frequency (in minutes).

          Password -> (string)
              Endpoint connection password.

          Port -> (integer)
              Endpoint TCP port. The default is 5432.

          ServerName -> (string)
              Fully qualified domain name of the endpoint.

          Username -> (string)
              Endpoint connection user name.

          SlotName -> (string)
              Sets  the  name of a previously created logical replication slot
              for a change data capture (CDC) load of  the  PostgreSQL  source
              instance.

              When  used  with  the CdcStartPosition request parameter for the
              DMS API , this attribute also makes it possible  to  use  native
              CDC start points. DMS verifies that the specified logical repli-
              cation slot exists before starting the CDC load  task.  It  also
              verifies  that the task was created with a valid setting of Cdc-
              StartPosition . If the specified slot doesn't exist or the  task
              doesn't have a valid CdcStartPosition setting, DMS raises an er-
              ror.

              For more information about setting the CdcStartPosition  request
              parameter, see Determining a CDC native start point in the Data-
              base Migration Service User Guide . For more  information  about
              using    CdcStartPosition    ,   see   CreateReplicationTask   ,
              StartReplicationTask , and ModifyReplicationTask .

          PluginName -> (string)
              Specifies the plugin to use to create a replication slot.

          SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that  speci-
              fies  DMS  as the trusted entity and grants the required permis-
              sions to access the value in  SecretsManagerSecret  .  The  role
              must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret has the
              value of the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager secret that al-
              lows access to the PostgreSQL endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 You  can  specify one of two sets of values for these permis-
                 sions. You can specify the values for this  setting  and  Se-
                 cretsManagerSecretId  .  Or you can specify clear-text values
                 for UserName , Password , ServerName , and Port .  You  can't
                 specify  both. For more information on creating this Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret and  the  SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn  and  Se-
                 cretsManagerSecretId required to access it, see Using secrets
                 to access Database Migration Service resources in  the  Data-
                 base Migration Service User Guide .

          SecretsManagerSecretId -> (string)
              The  full  ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of the SecretsMan-
              agerSecret that contains the PostgreSQL endpoint connection  de-
              tails.

          TrimSpaceInChar -> (boolean)
              Use  the TrimSpaceInChar source endpoint setting to trim data on
              CHAR and NCHAR data types during migration. The default value is
              true .

       --my-sql-settings (structure)
          Settings  in  JSON  format for the source and target MySQL endpoint.
          For information about other available settings, see Extra connection
          attributes when using MySQL as a source for DMS and Extra connection
          attributes when using a MySQL-compatible database as  a  target  for
          DMS in the Database Migration Service User Guide.

          AfterConnectScript -> (string)
              Specifies  a script to run immediately after DMS connects to the
              endpoint. The migration task continues running regardless if the
              SQL statement succeeds or fails.

              For  this  parameter, provide the code of the script itself, not
              the name of a file containing the script.

          CleanSourceMetadataOnMismatch -> (boolean)
              Adjusts the behavior of DMS when migrating from  an  SQL  Server
              source  database  that  is hosted as part of an Always On avail-
              ability group cluster. If you need DMS to poll all the nodes  in
              the  Always  On cluster for transaction backups, set this attri-
              bute to false .

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              Database name for the endpoint. For a  MySQL  source  or  target
              endpoint,  don't  explicitly  specify  the  database  using  the
              DatabaseName request parameter on either the  CreateEndpoint  or
              ModifyEndpoint API call. Specifying DatabaseName when you create
              or modify a MySQL endpoint replicates all  the  task  tables  to
              this single database. For MySQL endpoints, you specify the data-
              base only when you specify the schema in the table-mapping rules
              of the DMS task.

          EventsPollInterval -> (integer)
              Specifies   how   often   to   check  the  binary  log  for  new
              changes/events when the database is idle. The  default  is  five
              seconds.

              Example: eventsPollInterval=5;

              In  the example, DMS checks for changes in the binary logs every
              five seconds.

          TargetDbType -> (string)
              Specifies where to migrate source tables on the  target,  either
              to  a single database or multiple databases. If you specify SPE-
              CIFIC_DATABASE , specify the database name using  the  Database-
              Name parameter of the Endpoint object.

              Example: targetDbType=MULTIPLE_DATABASES

          MaxFileSize -> (integer)
              Specifies  the  maximum  size  (in  KB) of any .csv file used to
              transfer data to a MySQL-compatible database.

              Example: maxFileSize=512

          ParallelLoadThreads -> (integer)
              Improves performance when loading data into the MySQL-compatible
              target  database.  Specifies how many threads to use to load the
              data into the MySQL-compatible target database. Setting a  large
              number of threads can have an adverse effect on database perfor-
              mance, because  a  separate  connection  is  required  for  each
              thread. The default is one.

              Example: parallelLoadThreads=1

          Password -> (string)
              Endpoint connection password.

          Port -> (integer)
              Endpoint TCP port.

          ServerName -> (string)
              Fully qualified domain name of the endpoint.

          ServerTimezone -> (string)
              Specifies the time zone for the source MySQL database.

              Example: serverTimezone=US/Pacific;

              Note: Do not enclose time zones in single quotes.

          Username -> (string)
              Endpoint connection user name.

          SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The  full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that speci-
              fies DMS as the trusted entity and grants the  required  permis-
              sions  to  access  the  value in SecretsManagerSecret . The role
              must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret has the
              value of the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager secret that al-
              lows access to the MySQL endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 You can specify one of two sets of values for  these  permis-
                 sions.  You  can  specify the values for this setting and Se-
                 cretsManagerSecretId . Or you can specify  clear-text  values
                 for  UserName  , Password , ServerName , and Port . You can't
                 specify both. For more information on creating this  Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret  and  the  SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn  and Se-
                 cretsManagerSecretId required to access it, see Using secrets
                 to  access  Database Migration Service resources in the Data-
                 base Migration Service User Guide .

          SecretsManagerSecretId -> (string)
              The full ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of  the  SecretsMan-
              agerSecret that contains the MySQL endpoint connection details.

          }

       --oracle-settings (structure)
          Settings  in  JSON format for the source and target Oracle endpoint.
          For information about other available settings, see Extra connection
          attributes  when  using Oracle as a source for DMS and Extra connec-
          tion attributes when using Oracle as a target for DMS in  the  Data-
          base Migration Service User Guide.

          AddSupplementalLogging -> (boolean)
              Set  this  attribute  to set up table-level supplemental logging
              for the Oracle database. This attribute enables PRIMARY KEY sup-
              plemental logging on all tables selected for a migration task.

              If  you use this option, you still need to enable database-level
              supplemental logging.

          ArchivedLogDestId -> (integer)
              Specifies the ID of the destination for the archived redo  logs.
              This  value should be the same as a number in the dest_id column
              of the v$archived_log view. If you work with an additional  redo
              log  destination,  use the AdditionalArchivedLogDestId option to
              specify the additional destination ID. Doing this improves  per-
              formance by ensuring that the correct logs are accessed from the
              outset.

          AdditionalArchivedLogDestId -> (integer)
              Set this attribute with ArchivedLogDestId in a primary/  standby
              setup.  This attribute is useful in the case of a switchover. In
              this case, DMS needs to know which destination  to  get  archive
              redo  logs  from  to  read changes. This need arises because the
              previous primary  instance  is  now  a  standby  instance  after
              switchover.

              Although  DMS supports the use of the Oracle RESETLOGS option to
              open the database, never use RESETLOGS unless necessary. For ad-
              ditional information about RESETLOGS , see RMAN Data Repair Con-
              cepts in the Oracle Database Backup and Recovery User's Guide .

          ExtraArchivedLogDestIds -> (list)
              Specifies the IDs of one  more  destinations  for  one  or  more
              archived redo logs. These IDs are the values of the dest_id col-
              umn in the  v$archived_log  view.  Use  this  setting  with  the
              archivedLogDestId   extra   connection   attribute   in  a  pri-
              mary-to-single setup or a primary-to-multiple-standby setup.

              This setting is useful in a switchover when you  use  an  Oracle
              Data  Guard database as a source. In this case, DMS needs infor-
              mation about what destination to get archive redo logs  from  to
              read  changes.  DMS  needs this because after the switchover the
              previous primary is a standby instance. For example, in  a  pri-
              mary-to-single  standby setup you might apply the following set-
              tings.
                 archivedLogDestId=1; ExtraArchivedLogDestIds=[2]

              In a primary-to-multiple-standby setup, you might apply the fol-
              lowing settings.
                 archivedLogDestId=1; ExtraArchivedLogDestIds=[2,3,4]

              Although  DMS supports the use of the Oracle RESETLOGS option to
              open the database, never use RESETLOGS  unless  it's  necessary.
              For more information about RESETLOGS , see RMAN Data Repair Con-
              cepts in the Oracle Database Backup and Recovery User's Guide .

              (integer)

          AllowSelectNestedTables -> (boolean)
              Set this attribute to true to enable replication of  Oracle  ta-
              bles containing columns that are nested tables or defined types.

          ParallelAsmReadThreads -> (integer)
              Set this attribute to change the number of threads that DMS con-
              figures to perform a change data capture (CDC) load using Oracle
              Automatic  Storage  Management (ASM). You can specify an integer
              value between 2 (the default) and 8 (the maximum). Use this  at-
              tribute together with the readAheadBlocks attribute.

          ReadAheadBlocks -> (integer)
              Set  this  attribute  to  change the number of read-ahead blocks
              that DMS configures to perform a change data capture (CDC)  load
              using Oracle Automatic Storage Management (ASM). You can specify
              an integer value between 1000 (the  default)  and  200,000  (the
              maximum).

          AccessAlternateDirectly -> (boolean)
              Set this attribute to false in order to use the Binary Reader to
              capture change data for an Amazon RDS for Oracle as the  source.
              This  tells the DMS instance to not access redo logs through any
              specified path prefix replacement using direct file access.

          UseAlternateFolderForOnline -> (boolean)
              Set this attribute to true in order to use the Binary Reader  to
              capture  change data for an Amazon RDS for Oracle as the source.
              This tells the DMS instance to use any specified prefix replace-
              ment to access all online redo logs.

          OraclePathPrefix -> (string)
              Set  this string attribute to the required value in order to use
              the Binary Reader to capture change data for an Amazon  RDS  for
              Oracle  as  the  source. This value specifies the default Oracle
              root used to access the redo logs.

          UsePathPrefix -> (string)
              Set this string attribute to the required value in order to  use
              the  Binary  Reader to capture change data for an Amazon RDS for
              Oracle as the source. This value specifies the path prefix  used
              to replace the default Oracle root to access the redo logs.

          ReplacePathPrefix -> (boolean)
              Set  this attribute to true in order to use the Binary Reader to
              capture change data for an Amazon RDS for Oracle as the  source.
              This  setting  tells  DMS instance to replace the default Oracle
              root with the specified usePathPrefix setting to access the redo
              logs.

          EnableHomogenousTablespace -> (boolean)
              Set  this  attribute to enable homogenous tablespace replication
              and create existing tables or indexes under the same  tablespace
              on the target.

          DirectPathNoLog -> (boolean)
              When  set  to true , this attribute helps to increase the commit
              rate on the Oracle target database by writing directly to tables
              and not writing a trail to database logs.

          ArchivedLogsOnly -> (boolean)
              When  this  field  is  set to Y , DMS only accesses the archived
              redo logs. If the archived redo logs are stored  on  Oracle  ASM
              only, the DMS user account needs to be granted ASM privileges.

          AsmPassword -> (string)
              For  an  Oracle  source  endpoint, your Oracle Automatic Storage
              Management (ASM) password. You can set this value  from  the  ``
              asm_user_password  ``  value.  You set this value as part of the
              comma-separated value that you set to the Password  request  pa-
              rameter  when you create the endpoint to access transaction logs
              using Binary Reader. For more information, see Configuration for
              change data capture (CDC) on an Oracle source database .

          AsmServer -> (string)
              For  an Oracle source endpoint, your ASM server address. You can
              set this value from the asm_server value. You set asm_server  as
              part  of the extra connection attribute string to access an Ora-
              cle server with Binary Reader that uses ASM. For  more  informa-
              tion, see Configuration for change data capture (CDC) on an Ora-
              cle source database .

          AsmUser -> (string)
              For an Oracle source endpoint, your ASM user name. You  can  set
              this  value from the asm_user value. You set asm_user as part of
              the extra connection attribute string to access an Oracle server
              with  Binary  Reader  that  uses  ASM. For more information, see
              Configuration for change data capture (CDC) on an Oracle  source
              database .

          CharLengthSemantics -> (string)
              Specifies  whether  the length of a character column is in bytes
              or in characters. To indicate that the character  column  length
              is  in  characters,  set this attribute to CHAR . Otherwise, the
              character column length is in bytes.

              Example: charLengthSemantics=CHAR;

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              Database name for the endpoint.

          DirectPathParallelLoad -> (boolean)
              When set to true , this attribute specifies a parallel load when
              useDirectPathFullLoad is set to Y . This attribute also only ap-
              plies when you use the DMS parallel load feature. Note that  the
              target table cannot have any constraints or indexes.

          FailTasksOnLobTruncation -> (boolean)
              When  set  to true , this attribute causes a task to fail if the
              actual size of an LOB column is greater than the specified  Lob-
              MaxSize .

              If  a  task is set to limited LOB mode and this option is set to
              true , the task fails instead of truncating the LOB data.

          NumberDatatypeScale -> (integer)
              Specifies the number scale. You can select a scale up to 38,  or
              you  can  select FLOAT. By default, the NUMBER data type is con-
              verted to precision 38, scale 10.

              Example: numberDataTypeScale=12

          Password -> (string)
              Endpoint connection password.

          Port -> (integer)
              Endpoint TCP port.

          ReadTableSpaceName -> (boolean)
              When set to true , this attribute supports  tablespace  replica-
              tion.

          RetryInterval -> (integer)
              Specifies the number of seconds that the system waits before re-
              sending a query.

              Example: retryInterval=6;

          SecurityDbEncryption -> (string)
              For an Oracle source endpoint, the transparent  data  encryption
              (TDE)  password  required  by AWM DMS to access Oracle redo logs
              encrypted by  TDE  using  Binary  Reader.  It  is  also  the  ``
              TDE_Password `` part of the comma-separated value you set to the
              Password request parameter when you create the endpoint. The Se-
              curityDbEncryptian  setting is related to this SecurityDbEncryp-
              tionName setting. For more information, see Supported encryption
              methods for using Oracle as a source for DMS in the Database Mi-

          SecurityDbEncryptionName -> (string)
              For an Oracle source endpoint, the name of a key  used  for  the
              transparent data encryption (TDE) of the columns and tablespaces
              in an Oracle source database that is encrypted  using  TDE.  The
              key  value is the value of the SecurityDbEncryption setting. For
              more information on setting the key name value of  SecurityDbEn-
              cryptionName  ,  see the information and example for setting the
              securityDbEncryptionName extra connection attribute in Supported
              encryption  methods  for using Oracle as a source for DMS in the
              Database Migration Service User Guide .

          ServerName -> (string)
              Fully qualified domain name of the endpoint.

          SpatialDataOptionToGeoJsonFunctionName -> (string)
              Use this attribute to convert SDO_GEOMETRY to GEOJSON format. By
              default,  DMS  calls  the SDO2GEOJSON custom function if present
              and accessible. Or you can create your own custom function  that
              mimics  the operation of SDOGEOJSON and set SpatialDataOptionTo-
              GeoJsonFunctionName to call it instead.

          StandbyDelayTime -> (integer)
              Use this attribute to specify a time in minutes for the delay in
              standby  sync.  If  the  source  is  an Oracle Active Data Guard
              standby database, use this attribute to specify the time lag be-
              tween primary and standby databases.

              In  DMS,  you  can create an Oracle CDC task that uses an Active
              Data Guard standby instance as a source for replicating  ongoing
              changes.  Doing this eliminates the need to connect to an active
              database that might be in production.

          Username -> (string)
              Endpoint connection user name.

          UseBFile -> (boolean)
              Set this attribute to Y to capture change data using the  Binary
              Reader utility. Set UseLogminerReader to N to set this attribute
              to Y. To use Binary Reader with Amazon RDS  for  Oracle  as  the
              source,  you  set  additional  attributes.  For more information
              about using this setting with Oracle Automatic  Storage  Manage-
              ment  (ASM),  see Using Oracle LogMiner or DMS Binary Reader for
              CDC .

          UseDirectPathFullLoad -> (boolean)
              Set this attribute to Y to have DMS use a direct path full load.
              Specify this value to use the direct path protocol in the Oracle
              Call Interface (OCI).  By  using  this  OCI  protocol,  you  can
              bulk-load Oracle target tables during a full load.

          UseLogminerReader -> (boolean)
              Set  this attribute to Y to capture change data using the Oracle
              LogMiner utility (the default). Set this attribute to N  if  you
              want  to  access  the  redo  logs as a binary file. When you set
              UseLogminerReader to N, also set UseBfile to Y. For more  infor-
              mation  on  this  setting and using Oracle ASM, see Using Oracle
              LogMiner or DMS Binary Reader for CDC in the DMS User Guide .

          SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that  speci-
              fies  DMS  as the trusted entity and grants the required permis-
              sions to access the value in  SecretsManagerSecret  .  The  role
              must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret has the
              value of the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager secret that al-
              lows access to the Oracle endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 You  can  specify one of two sets of values for these permis-
                 sions. You can specify the values for this  setting  and  Se-
                 cretsManagerSecretId  .  Or you can specify clear-text values
                 for UserName , Password , ServerName , and Port .  You  can't
                 specify  both. For more information on creating this Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret and  the  SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn  and  Se-

                 to access Database Migration Service resources in  the  Data-
                 base Migration Service User Guide .

          SecretsManagerSecretId -> (string)
              The  full  ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of the SecretsMan-
              agerSecret that contains the Oracle endpoint connection details.

          SecretsManagerOracleAsmAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              Required only if your Oracle endpoint uses Advanced Storage Man-
              ager  (ASM).  The full ARN of the IAM role that specifies DMS as
              the trusted entity and grants the required permissions to access
              the   SecretsManagerOracleAsmSecret  .  This  SecretsManagerOra-
              cleAsmSecret has the secret value that allows access to the Ora-
              cle ASM of the endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 You  can  specify one of two sets of values for these permis-
                 sions. You can specify the values for this  setting  and  Se-
                 cretsManagerOracleAsmSecretId . Or you can specify clear-text
                 values for AsmUserName , AsmPassword ,  and  AsmServerName  .
                 You can't specify both. For more information on creating this
                 SecretsManagerOracleAsmSecret and the SecretsManagerOracleAs-
                 mAccessRoleArn  and  SecretsManagerOracleAsmSecretId required
                 to access it, see Using secrets to access Database  Migration
                 Service  resources  in  the  Database  Migration Service User
                 Guide .

          SecretsManagerOracleAsmSecretId -> (string)
              Required only if your Oracle endpoint uses Advanced Storage Man-
              ager  (ASM).  The full ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of the
              SecretsManagerOracleAsmSecret that contains the Oracle ASM  con-
              nection details for the Oracle endpoint.

          TrimSpaceInChar -> (boolean)
              Use  the TrimSpaceInChar source endpoint setting to trim data on
              CHAR and NCHAR data types during migration. The default value is
              true .

          Port -> (integer)
              Endpoint TCP port.

          BcpPacketSize -> (integer)
              The maximum size of the packets (in bytes) used to transfer data
              using BCP.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              Database name for the endpoint.

          ControlTablesFileGroup -> (string)
              Specifies  a  file  group  for the DMS internal tables. When the
              replication task starts, all the internal DMS control tables (
              awsdms_
               apply_exception, awsdms_apply, awsdms_changes) are created  for
              the specified file group.

          Password -> (string)
              Endpoint connection password.

          QuerySingleAlwaysOnNode -> (boolean)
              Cleans  and recreates table metadata information on the replica-
              tion instance when a mismatch occurs. An example is a  situation
              where  running an alter DDL statement on a table might result in
              different information about the table cached in the  replication
              instance.

          ReadBackupOnly -> (boolean)
              When  this  attribute  is set to Y , DMS only reads changes from
              transaction log backups and doesn't read from the active  trans-
              action log file during ongoing replication. Setting this parame-
              ter to Y enables you to  control  active  transaction  log  file
              growth  during full load and ongoing replication tasks. However,
              it can add some source latency to ongoing replication.

          SafeguardPolicy -> (string)
              Use this attribute to minimize the need to access the backup log
              and  enable DMS to prevent truncation using one of the following
              two methods.
                 Start transactions in  the  database:  This  is  the  default
                 method.  When  this method is used, DMS prevents TLOG trunca-
                 tion by mimicking a transaction in the database. As  long  as
                 such  a  transaction  is  open, changes that appear after the
                 transaction started aren't truncated. If you  need  Microsoft
                 Replication  to  be  enabled  in your database, then you must
                 choose this method.

                 Exclusively use sp_repldone within a single task : When  this
                 method  is  used,  DMS reads the changes and then uses sp_re-
                 pldone to mark the TLOG transactions as ready for truncation.
                 Although this method doesn't involve any transactional activ-
                 ities, it can only be used when Microsoft  Replication  isn't
                 running.  Also, when using this method, only one DMS task can
                 access the database at any given time. Therefore, if you need
                 to  run parallel DMS tasks against the same database, use the
                 default method.

          ServerName -> (string)
              Fully qualified domain name of the endpoint.

          Username -> (string)
              Endpoint connection user name.

          UseBcpFullLoad -> (boolean)
              Use this to attribute to transfer data for full-load  operations
              using  BCP.  When  the  target table contains an identity column
              that does not exist in the source table, you  must  disable  the
              use BCP for loading table option.

          UseThirdPartyBackupDevice -> (boolean)
              When  this  attribute  is  set  to Y , DMS processes third-party
              transaction log backups if they are created in native format.

          SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that  speci-
              fies  DMS  as the trusted entity and grants the required permis-
              sions to access the value in  SecretsManagerSecret  .  The  role
              must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret has the
              value of the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager secret that al-
              lows access to the SQL Server endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 You  can  specify one of two sets of values for these permis-
                 sions. You can specify the values for this  setting  and  Se-
                 cretsManagerSecretId  .  Or you can specify clear-text values
                 for UserName , Password , ServerName , and Port .  You  can't
                 specify  both. For more information on creating this Secrets-

                 to access Database Migration Service resources in  the  Data-
                 base Migration Service User Guide .

          SecretsManagerSecretId -> (string)
              The  full  ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of the SecretsMan-
              agerSecret that contains the SQL Server endpoint connection  de-
              tails.

          TrimSpaceInChar -> (boolean)
              Use  the TrimSpaceInChar source endpoint setting to trim data on
              CHAR and NCHAR data types during migration. The default value is
              true .

              Enables ongoing replication (CDC) as a BOOLEAN  value.  The  de-
              fault is true.

          CurrentLsn -> (string)
              For  ongoing  replication (CDC), use CurrentLSN to specify a log
              sequence number (LSN) where you want the replication to start.

          MaxKBytesPerRead -> (integer)
              Maximum number of bytes per read, as a NUMBER value. The default

              Endpoint connection user name.

          SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The  full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that speci-
              fies DMS as the trusted entity and grants the  required  permis-
              sions  to  access  the  value in SecretsManagerSecret . The role
              must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret has the
              value of the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager secret that al-
              lows access to the Db2 LUW endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 You can specify one of two sets of values for  these  permis-
                 sions.  You  can  specify the values for this setting and Se-
                 cretsManagerSecretId . Or you can specify  clear-text  values
                 for  UserName  , Password , ServerName , and Port . You can't
                 specify both. For more information on creating this  Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret  and  the  SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn  and Se-
                 cretsManagerSecretId required to access it, see Using secrets
                 to  access  Database Migration Service resources in the Data-
                 base Migration Service User Guide .

       --resource-identifier (string)
          A friendly name for the resource identifier at the end of  the  End-
          pointArn response parameter that is returned in the created Endpoint
          object. The value for this parameter can have up to  31  characters.
          It  can  contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphen ('-'). Also,
          it can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive  hyphens,  and
          can  only  begin with a letter, such as Example-App-ARN1 . For exam-
          ple,  this   value   might   result   in   the   EndpointArn   value
          arn:aws:dms:eu-west-1:012345678901:rep:Example-App-ARN1   .  If  you
          don't specify a ResourceIdentifier value, DMS  generates  a  default
          identifier value for the end of EndpointArn .

       --doc-db-settings (structure)
          Provides information that defines a DocumentDB endpoint.

          Username -> (string)
              The user name you use to access the DocumentDB source endpoint.

          Password -> (string)
              The  password  for  the user account you use to access the Docu-

              The  KMS  key  identifier that is used to encrypt the content on
              the replication instance. If you don't specify a value  for  the
              KmsKeyId  parameter,  then DMS uses your default encryption key.
              KMS creates the default encryption key for your Amazon Web  Ser-
              vices  account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different
              default encryption key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

          SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that  speci-
              fies  DMS  as the trusted entity and grants the required permis-
              sions to access the value in  SecretsManagerSecret  .  The  role
              must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret has the
              value of the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager secret that al-
              lows access to the DocumentDB endpoint.

                 sions. You can specify the values for this  setting  and  Se-
                 cretsManagerSecretId  .  Or you can specify clear-text values
                 for UserName , Password , ServerName , and Port .  You  can't
                 specify  both. For more information on creating this Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret and  the  SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn  and  Se-

          }

       --redis-settings (structure)
          Settings in JSON format for the target Redis endpoint.

          ServerName -> (string)
              Fully qualified domain name of the endpoint.

          Port -> (integer)
              Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port for the endpoint.

          SslSecurityProtocol -> (string)
              The  connection to a Redis target endpoint using Transport Layer
              Security (TLS). Valid values include plaintext  and  ssl-encryp-
              tion . The default is ssl-encryption . The ssl-encryption option
              makes an encrypted connection. Optionally, you can  identify  an
              Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an SSL certificate authority (CA)
              using the SslCaCertificateArn setting. If an ARN isn't given for
              a CA, DMS uses the Amazon root CA.

              The  plaintext  option  doesn't provide Transport Layer Security
              (TLS) encryption for traffic between endpoint and database.

          AuthType -> (string)
              The type of authentication to perform when connecting to a Redis
              target.  Options include none , auth-token , and auth-role . The
              auth-token option requires an AuthPassword value to be provided.
              The auth-role option requires AuthUserName and AuthPassword val-
              ues to be provided.

          AuthUserName -> (string)
              The user name provided with the auth-role option of the AuthType
              setting for a Redis target endpoint.

          AuthPassword -> (string)
              The  password provided with the auth-role and auth-token options
              of the AuthType setting for a Redis target endpoint.

          SslCaCertificateArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  for  the  certificate  authority
              (CA) that DMS uses to connect to your Redis target endpoint.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ServerName=string,Port=integer,SslSecurityProtocol=string,AuthType=string,AuthUserName=string,AuthPassword=string,SslCaCertificateArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ServerName": "string",
            "Port": integer,
            "SslSecurityProtocol": "plaintext"|"ssl-encryption",

            "AuthUserName": "string",
            "AuthPassword": "string",
            "SslCaCertificateArn": "string"
          }

       --gcp-my-sql-settings (structure)
          Settings in JSON format for the source GCP MySQL endpoint.

          AfterConnectScript -> (string)
              Specifies  a script to run immediately after DMS connects to the
              endpoint. The migration task continues running regardless if the
              SQL statement succeeds or fails.

              For  this  parameter, provide the code of the script itself, not
              the name of a file containing the script.

          CleanSourceMetadataOnMismatch -> (boolean)
              Adjusts the behavior of DMS when migrating from  an  SQL  Server
              source  database  that  is hosted as part of an Always On avail-
              ability group cluster. If you need DMS to poll all the nodes  in
              the  Always  On cluster for transaction backups, set this attri-
              bute to false .

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              Database name for the endpoint. For a  MySQL  source  or  target
              endpoint,  don't  explicitly  specify  the  database  using  the
              DatabaseName request parameter on either the  CreateEndpoint  or
              ModifyEndpoint API call. Specifying DatabaseName when you create
              or modify a MySQL endpoint replicates all  the  task  tables  to
              this single database. For MySQL endpoints, you specify the data-
              base only when you specify the schema in the table-mapping rules
              of the DMS task.

          EventsPollInterval -> (integer)
              Specifies   how   often   to   check  the  binary  log  for  new
              changes/events when the database is idle. The  default  is  five
              seconds.

              Example: eventsPollInterval=5;

              In  the example, DMS checks for changes in the binary logs every
              five seconds.

          TargetDbType -> (string)
              Specifies where to migrate source tables on the  target,  either
              to a single database or multiple databases.

              Example: targetDbType=MULTIPLE_DATABASES

          MaxFileSize -> (integer)
              Specifies  the  maximum  size  (in  KB) of any .csv file used to
              transfer data to a MySQL-compatible database.

              Example: maxFileSize=512

          ParallelLoadThreads -> (integer)
              Improves performance when loading data into the MySQL-compatible
              target  database.  Specifies how many threads to use to load the
              data into the MySQL-compatible target database. Setting a  large
              number of threads can have an adverse effect on database perfor-
              mance, because  a  separate  connection  is  required  for  each
              thread. The default is one.

              Example: parallelLoadThreads=1

          Password -> (string)
              Endpoint connection password.

          Port -> (integer)

          ServerName -> (string)
              Endpoint TCP port.

          ServerTimezone -> (string)
              Specifies the time zone for the source MySQL database.

              Example: serverTimezone=US/Pacific;

              Note: Do not enclose time zones in single quotes.

          Username -> (string)
              Endpoint connection user name.

          SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The  full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that speci-
              fies DMS as the trusted entity and grants the  required  permis-
              sions to access the value in SecretsManagerSecret. The role must
              allow the  iam:PassRole  action.  SecretsManagerSecret  has  the
              value of the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager secret that al-
              lows access to the MySQL endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 You can specify one of two sets of values for  these  permis-
                 sions.  You  can  specify the values for this setting and Se-
                 cretsManagerSecretId . Or you can specify  clear-text  values
                 for  UserName  , Password , ServerName , and Port . You can't
                 specify both. For more information on creating this  Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret  and  the  SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn  and Se-
                 cretsManagerSecretId required to access it, see Using secrets

                 base Migration Service User Guide.

          SecretsManagerSecretId -> (string)
              The full ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of  the  SecretsMan-
              agerSecret that contains the MySQL endpoint connection details.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens.
              They can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          EndpointType -> (string)
              The type of endpoint. Valid values are source and target .

          EngineName -> (string)
              The  database  engine  name. Valid values, depending on the End-
              pointType, include "mysql" , "oracle" , "postgres" , "mariadb" ,
              "aurora"  ,  "aurora-postgresql"  ,  "opensearch" , "redshift" ,
              "s3" , "db2" , "azuredb" , "sybase" , "dynamodb" ,  "mongodb"  ,
              "kinesis"   ,   "kafka"   ,  "elasticsearch"  ,  "documentdb"  ,
              "sqlserver" , and "neptune" .

          EngineDisplayName -> (string)
              The expanded name for the engine name. For example, if the Engi-
              neName parameter is "aurora," this value would be "Amazon Aurora
              MySQL."

          Username -> (string)
              The user name used to connect to the endpoint.

          ServerName -> (string)
              The name of the server at the endpoint.

          Port -> (integer)
              The port value used to access the endpoint.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              The name of the database at the endpoint.

          ExtraConnectionAttributes -> (string)
              Additional connection attributes used to  connect  to  the  end-
              point.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the endpoint.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              An KMS key identifier that is used to encrypt the connection pa-
              rameters for the endpoint.

              If you don't specify a value for the  KmsKeyId  parameter,  then
              DMS uses your default encryption key.

              KMS  creates the default encryption key for your Amazon Web Ser-
              vices account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a  different
              default encryption key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

          EndpointArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) string that uniquely identifies
              the endpoint.

          CertificateArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) used for SSL  connection  to  the
              endpoint.

          SslMode -> (string)
              The  SSL mode used to connect to the endpoint. The default value
              is none .

          ServiceAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) used by the service to access the
              IAM role. The role must allow the iam:PassRole action.

          ExternalTableDefinition -> (string)
              The external table definition.

          ExternalId -> (string)
              Value  returned by a call to CreateEndpoint that can be used for
              cross-account validation. Use it on a subsequent  call  to  Cre-
              ateEndpoint to create the endpoint with a cross-account.

          DynamoDbSettings -> (structure)
              The settings for the DynamoDB target endpoint. For more informa-
              tion, see the DynamoDBSettings structure.

              ServiceAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) used by the service to  access
                 the IAM role. The role must allow the iam:PassRole action.

          S3Settings -> (structure)
              The  settings  for the S3 target endpoint. For more information,
              see the S3Settings structure.

              ServiceAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) used by the service to  access
                 the IAM role. The role must allow the iam:PassRole action. It
                 is a required parameter that enables DMS to  write  and  read
                 objects from an S3 bucket.

              ExternalTableDefinition -> (string)
                 Specifies how tables are defined in the S3 source files only.

              CsvRowDelimiter -> (string)
                 The delimiter used to separate rows in the .csv file for both
                 source and target. The default is a carriage return (\n ).

              CsvDelimiter -> (string)
                 The delimiter used to separate columns in the .csv  file  for
                 both source and target. The default is a comma.

              BucketFolder -> (string)
                 An  optional parameter to set a folder name in the S3 bucket.
                 If provided, tables are created in the path  ``  bucketFolder
                 /schema_name /table_name /`` . If this parameter isn't speci-
                 fied, then the path used is `` schema_name /table_name /`` .

              BucketName -> (string)
                 The name of the S3 bucket.

              CompressionType -> (string)
                 An optional parameter to use  GZIP  to  compress  the  target
                 files.  Set  to GZIP to compress the target files. Either set
                 this parameter to NONE (the default) or don't use it to leave
                 the  files  uncompressed. This parameter applies to both .csv
                 and .parquet file formats.

              EncryptionMode -> (string)
                 The type of server-side encryption that you want to  use  for
                 your  data. This encryption type is part of the endpoint set-
                 tings or the extra connections attributes for Amazon S3.  You
                 can choose either SSE_S3 (the default) or SSE_KMS .

                 NOTE:
                     For  the ModifyEndpoint operation, you can change the ex-
                     isting value of the EncryptionMode parameter from SSE_KMS
                     to  SSE_S3  . But you cant change the existing value from
                     SSE_S3 to SSE_KMS .

                 To use SSE_S3 , you need an Identity  and  Access  Management
                 (IAM)  role  with permission to allow "arn:aws:s3:::dms-*" to
                 use the following actions:

                 o s3:CreateBucket

                 o s3:ListBucket

                 o s3:DeleteBucket

                 o s3:GetBucketLocation

                 o s3:GetObject

                 o s3:PutObject

                 o s3:DeleteObject

                 o s3:GetObjectVersion

                 o s3:GetBucketPolicy

                 o s3:PutBucketPolicy

                 o s3:DeleteBucketPolicy

              ServerSideEncryptionKmsKeyId -> (string)
                 If you are using SSE_KMS for the EncryptionMode , provide the
                 KMS  key  ID.  The  key that you use needs an attached policy
                 that enables Identity and Access Management (IAM)  user  per-
                 missions and allows use of the key.

                 Here is a CLI example:
                 ``
                 aws  dms  create-endpoint  --endpoint-identifier value --end-
                 point-type target --engine-name s3  --s3-settings  ServiceAc-
                 cessRoleArn=*value* ,BucketFolder=*value* ,BucketName=*value*
                 ,EncryptionMode=SSE_KMS,ServerSideEncryptionKmsKeyId=*value*
                 ``

                 System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 4734)
                        Inline literal start-string without end-string.

              DataFormat -> (string)
                 The  format  of the data that you want to use for output. You
                 can choose one of the following:

                 o csv : This is a row-based file format with  comma-separated
                   values (.csv).

                 o parquet  :  Apache Parquet (.parquet) is a columnar storage
                   file format that features efficient  compression  and  pro-
                   vides faster query response.

              EncodingType -> (string)
                 The type of encoding you are using:

                 o RLE_DICTIONARY   uses  a  combination  of  bit-packing  and
                   run-length encoding to store  repeated  values  more  effi-
                   ciently. This is the default.

                 o PLAIN  doesn't  use  encoding  at all. Values are stored as
                   they are.

                 o PLAIN_DICTIONARY builds a dictionary of the values  encoun-
                   tered in a given column. The dictionary is stored in a dic-
                   tionary page for each column chunk.

              DictPageSizeLimit -> (integer)
                 The maximum size of an encoded dictionary page of  a  column.
                 If  the  dictionary  page exceeds this, this column is stored
                 using an encoding type of PLAIN . This parameter defaults  to
                 1024  *  1024 bytes (1 MiB), the maximum size of a dictionary
                 page before it reverts to PLAIN encoding. This size  is  used
                 for .parquet file format only.

              RowGroupLength -> (integer)
                 The  number  of rows in a row group. A smaller row group size
                 provides faster reads. But as the number of row groups grows,
                 the  slower  writes become. This parameter defaults to 10,000
                 rows. This number is used for .parquet file format only.

                 If you choose a value larger than the maximum, RowGroupLength
                 is  set  to  the  max  row group length in bytes (64 * 1024 *
                 1024).

              DataPageSize -> (integer)
                 The size of one data page in bytes. This  parameter  defaults
                 to  1024  * 1024 bytes (1 MiB). This number is used for .par-
                 quet file format only.

              ParquetVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the Apache Parquet format  that  you  want  to
                 use: parquet_1_0 (the default) or parquet_2_0 .

              EnableStatistics -> (boolean)
                 A  value  that  enables  statistics for Parquet pages and row
                 groups. Choose true to enable statistics, false  to  disable.
                 Statistics  include  NULL  , DISTINCT , MAX , and MIN values.
                 This parameter defaults to true .  This  value  is  used  for
                 .parquet file format only.

              IncludeOpForFullLoad -> (boolean)
                 A  value  that enables a full load to write INSERT operations
                 to the comma-separated value (.csv) output files only to  in-
                 dicate how the rows were added to the source database.

                 NOTE:
                     DMS  supports  the IncludeOpForFullLoad parameter in ver-
                     sions 3.1.4 and later.

                 For full load, records can only be inserted. By default  (the
                 false  setting),  no  information is recorded in these output
                 files for a full load to indicate that the rows were inserted
                 at  the  source  database.  If IncludeOpForFullLoad is set to
                 true or y , the INSERT is recorded as an I annotation in  the
                 first  field of the .csv file. This allows the format of your
                 target records from a full load to  be  consistent  with  the
                 target records from a CDC load.

                 NOTE:
                     This  setting  works together with the CdcInsertsOnly and
                     the CdcInsertsAndUpdates parameters for  output  to  .csv
                     files only. For more information about how these settings
                     work together, see Indicating Source DB Operations in Mi-
                     grated  S3  Data  in  the Database Migration Service User
                     Guide. .

              CdcInsertsOnly -> (boolean)
                 A value that enables a change  data  capture  (CDC)  load  to
                 write  only  INSERT  operations  to  .csv or columnar storage
                 (.parquet) output files. By default (the false setting),  the
                 first  field in a .csv or .parquet record contains the letter
                 I (INSERT), U (UPDATE), or D (DELETE). These values  indicate
                 whether  the  row  was  inserted,  updated, or deleted at the
                 source database for a CDC load to the target.

                 If CdcInsertsOnly is set to true or y , only INSERTs from the
                 source  database  are  migrated to the .csv or .parquet file.
                 For .csv format only, how these INSERTs are recorded  depends
                 on  the  value of IncludeOpForFullLoad . If IncludeOpForFull-
                 Load is set to true , the first field of every CDC record  is
                 set  to  I to indicate the INSERT operation at the source. If
                 IncludeOpForFullLoad is set to false , every  CDC  record  is
                 written  without  a first field to indicate the INSERT opera-
                 tion at the source. For more information about how these set-
                 tings  work  together, see Indicating Source DB Operations in
                 Migrated S3 Data  in  the  Database  Migration  Service  User
                 Guide. .

                 NOTE:
                     DMS  supports the interaction described preceding between
                     the CdcInsertsOnly and IncludeOpForFullLoad parameters in
                     versions 3.1.4 and later.
                        CdcInsertsOnly  and CdcInsertsAndUpdates can't both be
                        set to true for the same endpoint. Set  either  CdcIn-
                        sertsOnly or CdcInsertsAndUpdates to true for the same
                        endpoint, but not both.

              TimestampColumnName -> (string)
                 A value that when nonblank causes DMS to add  a  column  with
                 timestamp  information  to the endpoint data for an Amazon S3
                 target.

                 NOTE:
                     DMS supports the TimestampColumnName  parameter  in  ver-
                     sions 3.1.4 and later.

                 DMS includes an additional STRING column in the .csv or .par-
                 quet object files of your migrated data when you  set  Times-
                 tampColumnName to a nonblank value.

                 For a full load, each row of this timestamp column contains a
                 timestamp for when the data was transferred from  the  source
                 to the target by DMS.

                 For  a  change data capture (CDC) load, each row of the time-
                 stamp column contains the timestamp for the  commit  of  that
                 row in the source database.

                 The   string  format  for  this  timestamp  column  value  is
                 yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS . By  default,  the  precision  of
                 this  value  is in microseconds. For a CDC load, the rounding
                 of the precision depends on the commit timestamp supported by
                 DMS for the source database.

                 When  the  AddColumnName  parameter is set to true , DMS also
                 includes a name for the timestamp column that  you  set  with
                 TimestampColumnName .

              ParquetTimestampInMillisecond -> (boolean)
                 A  value that specifies the precision of any TIMESTAMP column
                 values that are written to an Amazon S3 object file in  .par-
                 quet format.

                 NOTE:
                     DMS  supports the ParquetTimestampInMillisecond parameter
                     in versions 3.1.4 and later.

                 When ParquetTimestampInMillisecond is set to true or y ,  DMS
                 writes  all  TIMESTAMP  columns  in a .parquet formatted file
                 with millisecond precision. Otherwise, DMS writes  them  with
                 microsecond precision.

                 Currently, Amazon Athena and Glue can handle only millisecond
                 precision for TIMESTAMP values. Set this  parameter  to  true
                 for S3 endpoint object files that are .parquet formatted only
                 if you plan to query or process the data with Athena or Glue.

                 NOTE:
                     DMS writes any TIMESTAMP column values written to  an  S3
                     file in .csv format with microsecond precision.

                     Setting  ParquetTimestampInMillisecond  has  no effect on
                     the string format of the timestamp column value  that  is
                     inserted by setting the TimestampColumnName parameter.

              CdcInsertsAndUpdates -> (boolean)
                 A  value  that  enables  a  change data capture (CDC) load to
                 write INSERT  and  UPDATE  operations  to  .csv  or  .parquet
                 (columnar storage) output files. The default setting is false
                 , but when CdcInsertsAndUpdates is set to true or  y  ,  only
                 INSERTs  and UPDATEs from the source database are migrated to
                 the .csv or .parquet file.

                 For .csv file format only, how these INSERTs and UPDATEs  are
                 recorded depends on the value of the IncludeOpForFullLoad pa-
                 rameter. If IncludeOpForFullLoad is set to true ,  the  first
                 field of every CDC record is set to either I or U to indicate
                 INSERT and UPDATE operations at the source. But if IncludeOp-
                 ForFullLoad is set to false , CDC records are written without
                 an indication of INSERT or UPDATE operations at  the  source.
                 For  more information about how these settings work together,
                 see Indicating Source DB Operations in Migrated  S3  Data  in
                 the Database Migration Service User Guide. .

                 NOTE:
                     DMS  supports the use of the CdcInsertsAndUpdates parame-
                     ter in versions 3.3.1 and later.
                        CdcInsertsOnly and CdcInsertsAndUpdates can't both  be
                        set  to  true for the same endpoint. Set either CdcIn-
                        sertsOnly or CdcInsertsAndUpdates to true for the same
                        endpoint, but not both.

              DatePartitionEnabled -> (boolean)
                 When  set to true , this parameter partitions S3 bucket fold-
                 ers based on transaction commit dates. The default  value  is
                 false  .  For more information about date-based folder parti-
                 tioning, see Using date-based folder partitioning .

              DatePartitionSequence -> (string)
                 Identifies the sequence of the  date  format  to  use  during
                 folder partitioning. The default value is YYYYMMDD . Use this
                 parameter when DatePartitionedEnabled is set to true .

              DatePartitionDelimiter -> (string)
                 Specifies a date separating delimiter to  use  during  folder
                 partitioning. The default value is SLASH . Use this parameter
                 when DatePartitionedEnabled is set to true .

              UseCsvNoSupValue -> (boolean)
                 This setting applies if the S3 output files during  a  change
                 data capture (CDC) load are written in .csv format. If set to
                 true for columns not included in the  supplemental  log,  DMS
                 uses    the    value    specified    by    `    CsvNoSupValue
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_S3Settings.html#DMS-Type-S3Settings-CsvNoSupValue`__
                 .  If  not  set or set to false , DMS uses the null value for
                 these columns.

                 NOTE:
                     This setting is  supported  in  DMS  versions  3.4.1  and
                     later.

              CsvNoSupValue -> (string)
                 This setting only applies if your Amazon S3 output files dur-
                 ing a change data capture (CDC) load are written in .csv for-
                 mat.             If             `            UseCsvNoSupValue
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_S3Settings.html#DMS-Type-S3Settings-UseCsvNoSupValue`__
                 is  set  to true, specify a string value that you want DMS to
                 use for all columns not included in the supplemental log.  If
                 you  do  not  specify a string value, DMS uses the null value
                 for these columns regardless of the UseCsvNoSupValue setting.

                 NOTE:
                     This setting is  supported  in  DMS  versions  3.4.1  and
                     later.

              PreserveTransactions -> (boolean)
                 If set to true , DMS saves the transaction order for a change
                 data capture (CDC) load on the Amazon S3 target specified  by
                 `                                                     CdcPath
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_S3Settings.html#DMS-Type-S3Settings-CdcPath`__
                 .  For more information, see Capturing data changes (CDC) in-
                 cluding transaction order on the S3 target .

                 NOTE:
                     This setting is  supported  in  DMS  versions  3.4.2  and
                     later.

              CdcPath -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  folder  path  of CDC files. For an S3 source,
                 this setting is required if a task captures change data; oth-
                 erwise, it's optional. If CdcPath is set, DMS reads CDC files
                 from this path and replicates the data changes to the  target
                 endpoint.  For an S3 target if you set ` PreserveTransactions
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_S3Settings.html#DMS-Type-S3Settings-PreserveTransactions`__
                 to  true , DMS verifies that you have set this parameter to a
                 folder path on your S3 target where DMS can save the transac-
                 tion order for the CDC load. DMS creates this CDC folder path
                 in either your S3 target working directory or the  S3  target
                 location        specified       by       `       BucketFolder
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_S3Settings.html#DMS-Type-S3Settings-BucketFolder`__
                 and                        `                       BucketName
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_S3Settings.html#DMS-Type-S3Settings-BucketName`__
                 .

                 For  example,  if  you specify CdcPath as MyChangedData , and
                 you specify BucketName as MyTargetBucket but do  not  specify
                 BucketFolder , DMS creates the CDC folder path following: My-
                 TargetBucket/MyChangedData .

                 If you specify the same CdcPath , and you specify  BucketName
                 as MyTargetBucket and BucketFolder as MyTargetData , DMS cre-
                 ates the CDC folder path following:  MyTargetBucket/MyTarget-
                 Data/MyChangedData .

                 For more information on CDC including transaction order on an
                 S3 target, see Capturing data changes (CDC) including  trans-
                 action order on the S3 target .

                 NOTE:
                     This  setting  is  supported  in  DMS  versions 3.4.2 and
                     later.

              UseTaskStartTimeForFullLoadTimestamp -> (boolean)
                 When set to true, this parameter uses the task start time  as
                 the  timestamp column value instead of the time data is writ-
                 ten to target. For full load,  when  useTaskStartTimeForFull-
                 LoadTimestamp is set to true , each row of the timestamp col-
                 umn contains the task start time. For CDC loads, each row  of
                 the timestamp column contains the transaction commit time.

                 When  useTaskStartTimeForFullLoadTimestamp  is set to false ,
                 the full load timestamp in the  timestamp  column  increments
                 with the time data arrives at the target.

              CannedAclForObjects -> (string)
                 A value that enables DMS to specify a predefined (canned) ac-
                 cess control list for objects created in an Amazon S3  bucket
                 as  .csv or .parquet files. For more information about Amazon
                 S3 canned ACLs, see Canned ACL in  the  Amazon  S3  Developer
                 Guide.

                 The  default  value  is NONE. Valid values include NONE, PRI-
                 VATE,  PUBLIC_READ,  PUBLIC_READ_WRITE,   AUTHENTICATED_READ,
                 AWS_EXEC_READ,  BUCKET_OWNER_READ, and BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CON-
                 TROL.

              AddColumnName -> (boolean)
                 An optional parameter that, when set to true or y ,  you  can
                 use to add column name information to the .csv output file.

                 The  default value is false . Valid values are true , false ,
                 y , and n .

              CdcMaxBatchInterval -> (integer)
                 Maximum length of the interval,  defined  in  seconds,  after
                 which to output a file to Amazon S3.

                 When  CdcMaxBatchInterval  and CdcMinFileSize are both speci-
                 fied, the file write is triggered by whichever parameter con-
                 dition is met first within an DMS CloudFormation template.

                 The default value is 60 seconds.

              CdcMinFileSize -> (integer)
                 Minimum  file size, defined in megabytes, to reach for a file
                 output to Amazon S3.

                 When CdcMinFileSize and CdcMaxBatchInterval are  both  speci-
                 fied, the file write is triggered by whichever parameter con-
                 dition is met first within an DMS CloudFormation template.

                 The default value is 32 MB.

              CsvNullValue -> (string)
                 An optional parameter that specifies how DMS treats null val-
                 ues.  While handling the null value, you can use this parame-
                 ter to pass a user-defined string as null when writing to the
                 target.  For  example,  when target columns are not nullable,
                 you can use this option to differentiate  between  the  empty
                 string  value and the null value. So, if you set this parame-
                 ter value to the empty string (""  or  ''),  DMS  treats  the
                 empty string as the null value instead of NULL .

                 The  default  value  is NULL . Valid values include any valid
                 string.

              IgnoreHeaderRows -> (integer)
                 When this value is set to 1, DMS ignores the first row header
                 in a .csv file. A value of 1 turns on the feature; a value of
                 0 turns off the feature.

                 The default is 0.

              MaxFileSize -> (integer)
                 A value that specifies the maximum size (in KB) of  any  .csv
                 file  to  be  created  while migrating to an S3 target during
                 full load.

                 The default value is 1,048,576 KB (1 GB).  Valid  values  in-
                 clude 1 to 1,048,576.

              Rfc4180 -> (boolean)
                 For  an S3 source, when this value is set to true or y , each
                 leading double quotation mark has to be followed by an ending
                 double  quotation  mark.  This  formatting  complies with RFC
                 4180. When this value is set to false or n , string  literals
                 are  copied  to  the  target as is. In this case, a delimiter
                 (row or column) signals the end of the field. Thus, you can't
                 use a delimiter as part of the string, because it signals the
                 end of the value.

                 For an S3 target, an optional parameter used to set  behavior
                 to  comply with RFC 4180 for data migrated to Amazon S3 using
                 .csv file format only. When this value is set to  true  or  y
                 using  Amazon S3 as a target, if the data has quotation marks
                 or newline characters in it, DMS encloses the  entire  column
                 with  an additional pair of double quotation marks ("). Every
                 quotation mark within the data is repeated twice.

                 The default value is true . Valid values include true , false
                 , y , and n .

              DatePartitionTimezone -> (string)
                 When  creating  an S3 target endpoint, set DatePartitionTime-
                 zone to convert the current UTC time into  a  specified  time
                 zone.  The  conversion occurs when a date partition folder is
                 created and a CDC filename is generated. The time zone format
                 is  Area/Location. Use this parameter when DatePartitionedEn-
                 abled is set to true , as shown in the following example.
                     s3-settings='{"DatePartitionEnabled":  true,  "DateParti-
                     tionSequence":   "YYYYMMDDHH",  "DatePartitionDelimiter":
                     "SLASH",     "DatePartitionTimezone":"*Asia/Seoul*     ",
                     "BucketName": "dms-nattarat-test"}'

              AddTrailingPaddingCharacter -> (boolean)
                 Use  the S3 target endpoint setting AddTrailingPaddingCharac-
                 ter to add padding on string data. The default value is false
                 .

              ExpectedBucketOwner -> (string)
                 To  specify  a  bucket owner and prevent sniping, you can use
                 the ExpectedBucketOwner endpoint setting.

                 Example:   --s3-settings='{"ExpectedBucketOwner":   "*AWS_Ac-
                 count_ID* "}'

                 When you make a request to test a connection or perform a mi-
                 gration, S3 checks the account ID of the bucket owner against
                 the specified parameter.

          DmsTransferSettings -> (structure)
              The settings for the DMS Transfer type source. For more informa-
              tion, see the DmsTransferSettings structure.

              ServiceAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) used by the service access IAM
                 role. The role must allow the iam:PassRole action.

              BucketName -> (string)
                 The name of the S3 bucket to use.

          MongoDbSettings -> (structure)
              The  settings for the MongoDB source endpoint. For more informa-
              tion, see the MongoDbSettings structure.

              Username -> (string)
                 The user name you use to access the MongoDB source endpoint.

              Password -> (string)
                 The password for the user account you use to access the  Mon-
                 goDB source endpoint.

              ServerName -> (string)
                 The name of the server on the MongoDB source endpoint.

              Port -> (integer)
                 The port value for the MongoDB source endpoint.

              DatabaseName -> (string)
                 The database name on the MongoDB source endpoint.

              AuthType -> (string)
                 The  authentication type you use to access the MongoDB source
                 endpoint.

                 When when set to "no" , user name and password parameters are
                 not used and can be empty.

              AuthMechanism -> (string)
                 The  authentication  mechanism  you use to access the MongoDB
                 source endpoint.

                 For the default value, in MongoDB version 2.x,  "default"  is
                 "mongodb_cr" . For MongoDB version 3.x or later, "default" is
                 "scram_sha_1" . This setting isn't used when AuthType is  set
                 to "no" .

              NestingLevel -> (string)
                 Specifies either document or table mode.

                 Default  value  is  "none"  .  Specify "none" to use document
                 mode. Specify "one" to use table mode.

              ExtractDocId -> (string)
                 Specifies the document ID. Use this setting when NestingLevel
                 is set to "none" .

                 Default value is "false" .

              DocsToInvestigate -> (string)
                 Indicates the number of documents to preview to determine the
                 document organization. Use this setting when NestingLevel  is
                 set to "one" .

                 Must  be  a  positive value greater than 0 . Default value is
                 1000 .

              AuthSource -> (string)
                 The MongoDB database name. This setting isn't used  when  Au-
                 thType is set to "no" .

                 The default is "admin" .

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The KMS key identifier that is used to encrypt the content on
                 the replication instance. If you don't specify  a  value  for
                 the KmsKeyId parameter, then DMS uses your default encryption
                 key. KMS creates the default encryption key for  your  Amazon
                 Web  Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a
                 different default encryption key for each Amazon Web Services
                 Region.

              SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  full  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the IAM role that
                 specifies DMS as the trusted entity and grants  the  required
                 permissions to access the value in SecretsManagerSecret . The
                 role must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret
                 has  the value of the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager se-
                 cret that allows access to the MongoDB endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     You can specify one of two sets of values for these  per-
                     missions. You can specify the values for this setting and
                     SecretsManagerSecretId . Or you  can  specify  clear-text
                     values  for UserName , Password , ServerName , and Port .
                     You can't specify both. For more information on  creating
                     this  SecretsManagerSecret  and the SecretsManagerAccess-
                     RoleArn and SecretsManagerSecretId required to access it,
                     see  Using  secrets  to access Database Migration Service
                     resources in the Database Migration Service User Guide .

              SecretsManagerSecretId -> (string)
                 The full ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of  the  Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret  that  contains the MongoDB endpoint connection
                 details.

          KinesisSettings -> (structure)
              The settings for the Amazon Kinesis target  endpoint.  For  more
              information, see the KinesisSettings structure.

              StreamArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) for the Amazon Kinesis Data
                 Streams endpoint.

              MessageFormat -> (string)
                 The output format for the records created  on  the  endpoint.
                 The  message  format is JSON (default) or JSON_UNFORMATTED (a
                 single line with no tab).

              ServiceAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the IAM role that DMS uses
                 to  write to the Kinesis data stream. The role must allow the
                 iam:PassRole action.

              IncludeTransactionDetails -> (boolean)
                 Provides detailed transaction  information  from  the  source
                 database. This information includes a commit timestamp, a log
                 position, and values for transaction_id ,  previous  transac-
                 tion_id , and transaction_record_id (the record offset within
                 a transaction). The default is false .

              IncludePartitionValue -> (boolean)
                 Shows the partition value within the Kinesis message  output,
                 unless  the partition type is schema-table-type . The default
                 is false .

              PartitionIncludeSchemaTable -> (boolean)
                 Prefixes schema and table names to partition values, when the
                 partition  type  is  primary-key-type  . Doing this increases
                 data distribution among Kinesis shards. For example,  suppose
                 that a SysBench schema has thousands of tables and each table
                 has only limited range for a primary key. In this  case,  the
                 same primary key is sent from thousands of tables to the same
                 shard, which causes throttling. The default is false .

              IncludeTableAlterOperations -> (boolean)
                 Includes any data definition language (DDL)  operations  that
                 change  the table in the control data, such as rename-table ,
                 drop-table , add-column , drop-column , and  rename-column  .
                 The default is false .

              IncludeControlDetails -> (boolean)
                 Shows detailed control information for table definition, col-
                 umn definition, and table and column changes in  the  Kinesis
                 message output. The default is false .

              IncludeNullAndEmpty -> (boolean)
                 Include  NULL  and  empty columns for records migrated to the
                 endpoint. The default is false .

              NoHexPrefix -> (boolean)
                 Set this optional parameter to true to avoid  adding  a  '0x'
                 prefix to raw data in hexadecimal format. For example, by de-
                 fault, DMS adds a '0x' prefix to the LOB column type in hexa-
                 decimal  format moving from an Oracle source to an Amazon Ki-
                 nesis target. Use the NoHexPrefix endpoint setting to  enable
                 migration  of  RAW  data type columns without adding the '0x'
                 prefix.

          KafkaSettings -> (structure)
              The settings for the Apache Kafka target endpoint. For more  in-
              formation, see the KafkaSettings structure.

              Broker -> (string)
                 A  comma-separated  list  of  one or more broker locations in
                 your Kafka cluster that host  your  Kafka  instance.  Specify
                 each  broker  location  in  the form `` broker-hostname-or-ip
                 :port `` . For example, "ec2-12-345-678-901.compute-1.amazon-
                 aws.com:2345" . For more information and examples of specify-
                 ing a list of broker locations, see Using Apache Kafka  as  a
                 target  for Database Migration Service in the Database Migra-
                 tion Service User Guide .

              Topic -> (string)
                 The topic to which you migrate the data. If you don't specify
                 a topic, DMS specifies "kafka-default-topic" as the migration
                 topic.

              MessageFormat -> (string)
                 The output format for the records created  on  the  endpoint.
                 The  message  format is JSON (default) or JSON_UNFORMATTED (a
                 single line with no tab).

              IncludeTransactionDetails -> (boolean)
                 Provides detailed transaction  information  from  the  source
                 database. This information includes a commit timestamp, a log
                 position, and values for transaction_id ,  previous  transac-
                 tion_id , and transaction_record_id (the record offset within
                 a transaction). The default is false .

              IncludePartitionValue -> (boolean)
                 Shows the partition value within the Kafka message output un-
                 less the partition type is schema-table-type . The default is
                 false .

              PartitionIncludeSchemaTable -> (boolean)
                 Prefixes schema and table names to partition values, when the
                 partition  type  is  primary-key-type  . Doing this increases
                 data distribution among Kafka partitions. For  example,  sup-
                 pose  that a SysBench schema has thousands of tables and each
                 table has only limited range for a primary key. In this case,
                 the  same primary key is sent from thousands of tables to the
                 same partition, which causes throttling. The default is false
                 .

              IncludeTableAlterOperations -> (boolean)
                 Includes  any  data definition language (DDL) operations that
                 change the table in the control data, such as rename-table  ,
                 drop-table  ,  add-column , drop-column , and rename-column .
                 The default is false .

              IncludeControlDetails -> (boolean)
                 Shows detailed control information for table definition, col-
                 umn  definition,  and  table  and column changes in the Kafka
                 message output. The default is false .

              MessageMaxBytes -> (integer)
                 The maximum size in bytes for records created on the endpoint
                 The default is 1,000,000.

              IncludeNullAndEmpty -> (boolean)
                 Include  NULL  and  empty columns for records migrated to the
                 endpoint. The default is false .

              SecurityProtocol -> (string)
                 Set secure connection to a Kafka target endpoint using Trans-
                 port  Layer  Security (TLS). Options include ssl-encryption ,
                 ssl-authentication  ,  and  sasl-ssl  .   sasl-ssl   requires
                 SaslUsername and SaslPassword .

              SslClientCertificateArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the client certificate used
                 to securely connect to a Kafka target endpoint.

              SslClientKeyArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for  the  client  private  key
                 used to securely connect to a Kafka target endpoint.

              SslClientKeyPassword -> (string)
                 The password for the client private key used to securely con-
                 nect to a Kafka target endpoint.

              SslCaCertificateArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for  the  private  certificate
                 authority (CA) cert that DMS uses to securely connect to your
                 Kafka target endpoint.

              SaslUsername -> (string)
                 The secure user name you created when you first set  up  your
                 MSK  cluster  to  validate  a client identity and make an en-
                 crypted connection between server and client  using  SASL-SSL
                 authentication.

              SaslPassword -> (string)
                 The  secure  password  you created when you first set up your
                 MSK cluster to validate a client identity  and  make  an  en-
                 crypted  connection  between server and client using SASL-SSL
                 authentication.

              NoHexPrefix -> (boolean)
                 Set this optional parameter to true to avoid  adding  a  '0x'
                 prefix to raw data in hexadecimal format. For example, by de-
                 fault, DMS adds a '0x' prefix to the LOB column type in hexa-
                 decimal  format  moving from an Oracle source to a Kafka tar-
                 get. Use the NoHexPrefix endpoint setting to enable migration
                 of RAW data type columns without adding the '0x' prefix.

          ElasticsearchSettings -> (structure)
              The settings for the OpenSearch source endpoint. For more infor-
              mation, see the ElasticsearchSettings structure.

              ServiceAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) used by the service to  access
                 the IAM role. The role must allow the iam:PassRole action.

              EndpointUri -> (string)
                 The  endpoint for the OpenSearch cluster. DMS uses HTTPS if a
                 transport protocol (http/https) is not specified.

              FullLoadErrorPercentage -> (integer)
                 The maximum percentage of records that can fail to be written
                 before a full load operation stops.

                 To  avoid early failure, this counter is only effective after
                 1000 records are transferred. OpenSearch also has the concept
                 of error monitoring during the last 10 minutes of an Observa-
                 tion Window. If transfer of all records fail in the  last  10
                 minutes, the full load operation stops.

              ErrorRetryDuration -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  number  of seconds for which DMS retries failed
                 API requests to the OpenSearch cluster.

              UseNewMappingType -> (boolean)
                 Set this option to true for DMS to migrate documentation  us-
                 ing  the documentation type _doc . OpenSearch and an Elastic-
                 search cluster only support the _doc  documentation  type  in
                 versions 7. x and later. The default value is false .

          NeptuneSettings -> (structure)
              The  settings  for  the Amazon Neptune target endpoint. For more
              information, see the NeptuneSettings structure.

              ServiceAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service role  that  you
                 created  for the Neptune target endpoint. The role must allow
                 the iam:PassRole action. For more information,  see  Creating
                 an  IAM Service Role for Accessing Amazon Neptune as a Target
                 in the Database Migration Service User Guide.

              S3BucketName -> (string)
                 The name of the Amazon S3 bucket where  DMS  can  temporarily
                 store  migrated  graph data in .csv files before bulk-loading
                 it to the Neptune target database. DMS maps  the  SQL  source
                 data to graph data before storing it in these .csv files.

              S3BucketFolder -> (string)
                 A folder path where you want DMS to store migrated graph data
                 in the S3 bucket specified by S3BucketName

              ErrorRetryDuration -> (integer)
                 The number of  milliseconds  for  DMS  to  wait  to  retry  a
                 bulk-load  of migrated graph data to the Neptune target data-
                 base before raising an error. The default is 250.

              MaxFileSize -> (integer)
                 The maximum size in kilobytes of migrated graph  data  stored
                 in  a .csv file before DMS bulk-loads the data to the Neptune
                 target database. The default is 1,048,576  KB.  If  the  bulk
                 load is successful, DMS clears the bucket, ready to store the
                 next batch of migrated graph data.

              MaxRetryCount -> (integer)
                 The number of times for DMS to retry a bulk load of  migrated
                 graph  data  to the Neptune target database before raising an
                 error. The default is 5.

              IamAuthEnabled -> (boolean)
                 If you want Identity and Access Management  (IAM)  authoriza-
                 tion  enabled for this endpoint, set this parameter to true .
                 Then attach the appropriate IAM policy document to your  ser-
                 vice  role specified by ServiceAccessRoleArn . The default is
                 false .

          RedshiftSettings -> (structure)
              Settings for the Amazon Redshift endpoint.

              AcceptAnyDate -> (boolean)
                 A value that indicates to allow any  date  format,  including
                 invalid formats such as 00/00/00 00:00:00, to be loaded with-
                 out generating an error. You can choose true  or  false  (the
                 default).

                 This  parameter  applies  only to TIMESTAMP and DATE columns.
                 Always use ACCEPTANYDATE with the  DATEFORMAT  parameter.  If
                 the  date  format  for  the data doesn't match the DATEFORMAT
                 specification, Amazon Redshift inserts a NULL value into that
                 field.

              AfterConnectScript -> (string)
                 Code  to  run after connecting. This parameter should contain
                 the code itself, not the name of a file containing the code.

              BucketFolder -> (string)
                 An S3 folder where the comma-separated-value (.csv) files are
                 stored before being uploaded to the target Redshift cluster.

                 For  full  load  mode,  DMS converts source records into .csv
                 files and loads them to the  BucketFolder/TableID  path.  DMS
                 uses  the  Redshift  COPY command to upload the .csv files to
                 the target table. The files are deleted once the COPY  opera-
                 tion has finished. For more information, see COPY in the Ama-
                 zon Redshift Database Developer Guide .

                 For change-data-capture (CDC) mode, DMS creates a  NetChanges
                 table,   and   loads   the   .csv   files   to  this  Bucket-
                 Folder/NetChangesTableID path.

              BucketName -> (string)
                 The name of the intermediate S3 bucket  used  to  store  .csv
                 files before uploading data to Redshift.

              CaseSensitiveNames -> (boolean)
                 If  Amazon  Redshift  is configured to support case sensitive
                 schema names, set CaseSensitiveNames to true . The default is
                 false .

              CompUpdate -> (boolean)
                 If  you  set CompUpdate to true Amazon Redshift applies auto-
                 matic compression if the table is empty. This applies even if
                 the  table columns already have encodings other than RAW . If
                 you set CompUpdate to false , automatic compression  is  dis-
                 abled  and  existing column encodings aren't changed. The de-
                 fault is true .

              ConnectionTimeout -> (integer)
                 A value that sets the amount of time to  wait  (in  millisec-
                 onds)  before  timing  out, beginning from when you initially
                 establish a connection.

              DatabaseName -> (string)
                 The name of the Amazon Redshift data warehouse (service) that
                 you are working with.

              DateFormat -> (string)
                 The  date  format  that  you are using. Valid values are auto
                 (case-sensitive), your date format string enclosed in quotes,
                 or  NULL. If this parameter is left unset (NULL), it defaults
                 to a format  of  'YYYY-MM-DD'.  Using  auto  recognizes  most
                 strings,  even some that aren't supported when you use a date
                 format string.

                 If your date and time values use formats different from  each
                 other, set this to auto .

              EmptyAsNull -> (boolean)
                 A  value that specifies whether DMS should migrate empty CHAR
                 and VARCHAR fields as NULL. A value of true sets  empty  CHAR
                 and VARCHAR fields to null. The default is false .

              EncryptionMode -> (string)
                 The  type  of server-side encryption that you want to use for
                 your data. This encryption type is part of the endpoint  set-
                 tings  or the extra connections attributes for Amazon S3. You
                 can choose either SSE_S3 (the default) or SSE_KMS .

                 NOTE:
                     For the ModifyEndpoint operation, you can change the  ex-
                     isting value of the EncryptionMode parameter from SSE_KMS
                     to SSE_S3 . But you cant change the existing  value  from
                     SSE_S3 to SSE_KMS .

                 To  use  SSE_S3  ,  create  an Identity and Access Management
                 (IAM) role with a policy that allows "arn:aws:s3:::*" to  use
                 the following actions: "s3:PutObject", "s3:ListBucket"

                 This  setting  is  only valid for a full-load migration task.
                 Set ExplicitIds to true to have tables with IDENTITY  columns
                 override  their  auto-generated  values  with explicit values
                 loaded from the source data files used to  populate  the  ta-
                 bles. The default is false .

              FileTransferUploadStreams -> (integer)
                 The  number of threads used to upload a single file. This pa-
                 rameter accepts a value from 1 through 64. It defaults to 10.

                 The number of parallel streams used to upload a  single  .csv
                 file  to an S3 bucket using S3 Multipart Upload. For more in-
                 formation, see Multipart upload overview .
                     FileTransferUploadStreams accepts a value from 1  through
                     64. It defaults to 10.

              LoadTimeout -> (integer)
                 The  amount  of  time to wait (in milliseconds) before timing
                 out of operations performed by DMS  on  a  Redshift  cluster,

              MaxFileSize -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  size (in KB) of any .csv file used to load data
                 on an S3 bucket and transfer data to Amazon Redshift. It  de-
                 faults to 1048576KB (1 GB).

              Password -> (string)
                 The password for the user named in the username property.

              Port -> (integer)

                 5439.

              RemoveQuotes -> (boolean)
                 A value that specifies to remove surrounding quotation  marks
                 from  strings in the incoming data. All characters within the
                 quotation marks, including delimiters, are  retained.  Choose
                 true to remove quotation marks. The default is false .

              ReplaceInvalidChars -> (string)
                 A  list  of characters that you want to replace. Use with Re-
                 placeChars .

                 cess  to the Amazon Redshift service. The role must allow the
                 iam:PassRole action.

              ServerSideEncryptionKmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The KMS key ID. If you are using SSE_KMS for the  Encryption-
                 Mode , provide this key ID. The key that you use needs an at-
                 tached policy that enables IAM user  permissions  and  allows
                 use of the key.

              TimeFormat -> (string)
                 The  time  format that you want to use. Valid values are auto
                 (case-sensitive),  'timeformat_string'  ,  'epochsecs'  ,  or
                 'epochmillisecs'  .  It defaults to 10. Using auto recognizes
                 most strings, even some that aren't supported when you use  a
                 time format string.

                 If  your date and time values use formats different from each
                 other, set this parameter to auto .

              TrimBlanks -> (boolean)
                 A value that specifies to remove  the  trailing  white  space
                 characters from a VARCHAR string. This parameter applies only
                 to columns with a VARCHAR data type. Choose  true  to  remove
                 unneeded white space. The default is false .

              TruncateColumns -> (boolean)
                 A value that specifies to truncate data in columns to the ap-
                 propriate number of characters, so that the data fits in  the
                 column. This parameter applies only to columns with a VARCHAR
                 or CHAR data type, and rows with a size  of  4  MB  or  less.
                 Choose true to truncate data. The default is false .

              Username -> (string)

                 generating .csv files on the local disk at the  DMS  replica-
                 tion  instance.  The  default  value  is 1000 (buffer size is
                 1000KB).

              SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  IAM  role  that
                 specifies  DMS  as the trusted entity and grants the required
                 permissions to access the value in SecretsManagerSecret . The
                 role must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret
                 has the value of the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager  se-
                 cret that allows access to the Amazon Redshift endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     You  can specify one of two sets of values for these per-
                     missions. You can specify the values for this setting and
                     SecretsManagerSecretId  .  Or  you can specify clear-text
                     values for UserName , Password , ServerName , and Port  .
                     You  can't specify both. For more information on creating
                     this SecretsManagerSecret and  the  SecretsManagerAccess-
                     RoleArn and SecretsManagerSecretId required to access it,
                     see Using secrets to access  Database  Migration  Service
                     resources in the Database Migration Service User Guide .

              SecretsManagerSecretId -> (string)
                 The  full  ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of the Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret that contains the Amazon Redshift endpoint con-
                 nection details.

          PostgreSQLSettings -> (structure)
              The  settings for the PostgreSQL source and target endpoint. For
              more information, see the PostgreSQLSettings structure.

              AfterConnectScript -> (string)
                 For use with change data capture (CDC) only,  this  attribute
                 has  DMS  bypass foreign keys and user triggers to reduce the
                 time it takes to bulk load data.

                 Example:       afterConnectScript=SET        session_replica-
                 tion_role='replica'

              CaptureDdls -> (boolean)
                 To  capture  DDL events, DMS creates various artifacts in the
                 PostgreSQL database when the task starts. You can  later  re-
                 move these artifacts.

                 If  this  value is set to N , you don't have to create tables
                 or triggers on the source database.

              MaxFileSize -> (integer)
                 Specifies the maximum size (in KB) of any .csv file  used  to
                 transfer data to PostgreSQL.

                 Example: maxFileSize=512

              DatabaseName -> (string)
                 Database name for the endpoint.

              DdlArtifactsSchema -> (string)
                 The  schema  in  which the operational DDL database artifacts
                 are created.

                 Example: ddlArtifactsSchema=xyzddlschema;

              ExecuteTimeout -> (integer)
                 Sets the client statement  timeout  for  the  PostgreSQL  in-
                 stance, in seconds. The default value is 60 seconds.

                 Example: executeTimeout=100;

              FailTasksOnLobTruncation -> (boolean)
                 When  set  to  true , this value causes a task to fail if the
                 actual size of a LOB column is  greater  than  the  specified
                 LobMaxSize .

                 If  task is set to Limited LOB mode and this option is set to
                 true, the task fails instead of truncating the LOB data.

              HeartbeatEnable -> (boolean)
                 The write-ahead log (WAL) heartbeat feature  mimics  a  dummy
                 transaction. By doing this, it prevents idle logical replica-
                 tion slots from holding onto old WAL logs, which  can  result
                 in  storage  full  situations  on  the source. This heartbeat
                 keeps restart_lsn moving and prevents storage full scenarios.

              HeartbeatSchema -> (string)
                 Sets the schema in which the heartbeat artifacts are created.

              HeartbeatFrequency -> (integer)
                 Sets the WAL heartbeat frequency (in minutes).

              Password -> (string)
                 Endpoint connection password.

              Port -> (integer)
                 Endpoint TCP port. The default is 5432.

              ServerName -> (string)
                 Fully qualified domain name of the endpoint.

              Username -> (string)
                 Endpoint connection user name.

              SlotName -> (string)
                 Sets the name of a  previously  created  logical  replication
                 slot  for  a change data capture (CDC) load of the PostgreSQL
                 source instance.

                 When used with the CdcStartPosition request parameter for the
                 DMS API , this attribute also makes it possible to use native
                 CDC start points. DMS verifies  that  the  specified  logical
                 replication slot exists before starting the CDC load task. It
                 also verifies that the task was created with a valid  setting
                 of  CdcStartPosition . If the specified slot doesn't exist or
                 the task doesn't have a valid CdcStartPosition  setting,  DMS
                 raises an error.

                 For  more  information about setting the CdcStartPosition re-
                 quest parameter, see Determining a CDC native start point  in
                 the Database Migration Service User Guide . For more informa-
                 tion about using CdcStartPosition , see CreateReplicationTask
                 , StartReplicationTask , and ModifyReplicationTask .

              PluginName -> (string)
                 Specifies the plugin to use to create a replication slot.

              SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  full  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the IAM role that
                 specifies DMS as the trusted entity and grants  the  required
                 permissions to access the value in SecretsManagerSecret . The
                 role must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret
                 has  the value of the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager se-
                 cret that allows access to the PostgreSQL endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     You can specify one of two sets of values for these  per-
                     missions. You can specify the values for this setting and
                     SecretsManagerSecretId . Or you  can  specify  clear-text
                     values  for UserName , Password , ServerName , and Port .
                     You can't specify both. For more information on  creating
                     this  SecretsManagerSecret  and the SecretsManagerAccess-
                     RoleArn and SecretsManagerSecretId required to access it,
                     see  Using  secrets  to access Database Migration Service
                     resources in the Database Migration Service User Guide .

              SecretsManagerSecretId -> (string)
                 The full ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of  the  Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret  that  contains the PostgreSQL endpoint connec-
                 tion details.

              TrimSpaceInChar -> (boolean)
                 Use the TrimSpaceInChar source endpoint setting to trim  data
                 on  CHAR  and  NCHAR data types during migration. The default
                 value is true .

          MySQLSettings -> (structure)
              The settings for the MySQL source and target endpoint. For  more
              information, see the MySQLSettings structure.

              AfterConnectScript -> (string)
                 Specifies  a  script to run immediately after DMS connects to
                 the endpoint. The migration task continues running regardless
                 if the SQL statement succeeds or fails.

                 For  this  parameter,  provide the code of the script itself,
                 not the name of a file containing the script.

              CleanSourceMetadataOnMismatch -> (boolean)
                 Adjusts the behavior of DMS when migrating from an SQL Server
                 source database that is hosted as part of an Always On avail-
                 ability group cluster. If you need DMS to poll all the  nodes
                 in  the  Always  On cluster for transaction backups, set this
                 attribute to false .

              DatabaseName -> (string)
                 Database name for the endpoint. For a MySQL source or  target
                 endpoint,  don't  explicitly  specify  the database using the
                 DatabaseName request parameter on either  the  CreateEndpoint
                 or  ModifyEndpoint API call. Specifying DatabaseName when you
                 create or modify a MySQL endpoint replicates all the task ta-
                 bles  to this single database. For MySQL endpoints, you spec-
                 ify the database only when you specify the schema in the  ta-
                 ble-mapping rules of the DMS task.

              EventsPollInterval -> (integer)
                 Specifies   how  often  to  check  the  binary  log  for  new
                 changes/events when the database is idle. The default is five
                 seconds.

                 Example: eventsPollInterval=5;

                 In the example, DMS checks for changes in the binary logs ev-
                 ery five seconds.

              TargetDbType -> (string)
                 Specifies where to migrate source tables on the  target,  ei-
                 ther to a single database or multiple databases. If you spec-
                 ify SPECIFIC_DATABASE , specify the database name  using  the
                 DatabaseName parameter of the Endpoint object.

                 Example: targetDbType=MULTIPLE_DATABASES

              MaxFileSize -> (integer)
                 Specifies  the  maximum size (in KB) of any .csv file used to
                 transfer data to a MySQL-compatible database.

                 Example: maxFileSize=512

              ParallelLoadThreads -> (integer)
                 Improves performance when loading data into the MySQL-compat-
                 ible  target  database.  Specifies how many threads to use to
                 load the data into the MySQL-compatible target database. Set-
                 ting  a large number of threads can have an adverse effect on
                 database performance, because a separate  connection  is  re-
                 quired for each thread. The default is one.

                 Example: parallelLoadThreads=1

              Password -> (string)
                 Endpoint connection password.

              Port -> (integer)
                 Endpoint TCP port.

              ServerName -> (string)
                 Fully qualified domain name of the endpoint.

              ServerTimezone -> (string)
                 Specifies the time zone for the source MySQL database.

                 Example: serverTimezone=US/Pacific;

                 Note: Do not enclose time zones in single quotes.

              Username -> (string)
                 Endpoint connection user name.

              SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  full  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the IAM role that
                 specifies DMS as the trusted entity and grants  the  required
                 permissions to access the value in SecretsManagerSecret . The
                 role must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret
                 has  the value of the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager se-
                 cret that allows access to the MySQL endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     You can specify one of two sets of values for these  per-
                     missions. You can specify the values for this setting and
                     SecretsManagerSecretId . Or you  can  specify  clear-text
                     values  for UserName , Password , ServerName , and Port .
                     You can't specify both. For more information on  creating
                     this  SecretsManagerSecret  and the SecretsManagerAccess-
                     RoleArn and SecretsManagerSecretId required to access it,
                     see  Using  secrets  to access Database Migration Service
                     resources in the Database Migration Service User Guide .

              SecretsManagerSecretId -> (string)
                 The full ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of  the  Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret that contains the MySQL endpoint connection de-
                 tails.

          OracleSettings -> (structure)
              The settings for the Oracle source and target endpoint. For more
              information, see the OracleSettings structure.

              AddSupplementalLogging -> (boolean)
                 Set this attribute to set up table-level supplemental logging
                 for the Oracle database. This attribute enables  PRIMARY  KEY
                 supplemental  logging  on all tables selected for a migration
                 task.

                 If you use this  option,  you  still  need  to  enable  data-
                 base-level supplemental logging.

              ArchivedLogDestId -> (integer)
                 Specifies  the  ID  of  the destination for the archived redo
                 logs. This value should be  the  same  as  a  number  in  the
                 dest_id  column  of the v$archived_log view. If you work with
                 an  additional  redo  log  destination,  use  the   Addition-
                 alArchivedLogDestId option to specify the additional destina-
                 tion ID. Doing this improves performance by ensuring that the
                 correct logs are accessed from the outset.

              AdditionalArchivedLogDestId -> (integer)
                 Set  this  attribute  with  ArchivedLogDestId  in  a primary/
                 standby setup. This attribute is useful  in  the  case  of  a
                 switchover. In this case, DMS needs to know which destination
                 to get archive redo logs from  to  read  changes.  This  need
                 arises because the previous primary instance is now a standby
                 instance after switchover.

                 Although DMS supports the use of the Oracle RESETLOGS  option
                 to  open  the database, never use RESETLOGS unless necessary.
                 For additional information about RESETLOGS ,  see  RMAN  Data
                 Repair  Concepts  in  the Oracle Database Backup and Recovery
                 User's Guide .

              ExtraArchivedLogDestIds -> (list)
                 Specifies the IDs of one more destinations for  one  or  more
                 archived  redo  logs. These IDs are the values of the dest_id
                 column in the v$archived_log view. Use this setting with  the
                 archivedLogDestId   extra  connection  attribute  in  a  pri-
                 mary-to-single setup or a primary-to-multiple-standby setup.

                 This setting is useful in a switchover when you use an Oracle
                 Data  Guard database as a source. In this case, DMS needs in-
                 formation about what destination to  get  archive  redo  logs
                 from  to  read  changes.  DMS  needs  this  because after the
                 switchover the previous primary is a  standby  instance.  For
                 example, in a primary-to-single standby setup you might apply
                 the following settings.
                     archivedLogDestId=1; ExtraArchivedLogDestIds=[2]

                 In a primary-to-multiple-standby setup, you might  apply  the
                 following settings.
                     archivedLogDestId=1; ExtraArchivedLogDestIds=[2,3,4]

                 Although  DMS supports the use of the Oracle RESETLOGS option
                 to open the database, never use RESETLOGS unless it's  neces-
                 sary.  For  more  information about RESETLOGS , see RMAN Data
                 Repair Concepts in the Oracle Database  Backup  and  Recovery
                 User's Guide .

                 (integer)

              AllowSelectNestedTables -> (boolean)
                 Set  this  attribute  to true to enable replication of Oracle
                 tables containing columns that are nested tables  or  defined
                 types.

              ParallelAsmReadThreads -> (integer)
                 Set  this  attribute to change the number of threads that DMS
                 configures to perform a change data capture (CDC) load  using
                 Oracle Automatic Storage Management (ASM). You can specify an
                 integer value between 2 (the default) and  8  (the  maximum).
                 Use  this  attribute together with the readAheadBlocks attri-
                 bute.

              ReadAheadBlocks -> (integer)
                 Set this attribute to change the number of read-ahead  blocks
                 that  DMS  configures  to perform a change data capture (CDC)
                 load using Oracle Automatic Storage Management (ASM). You can
                 specify  an  integer  value  between  1000  (the default) and
                 200,000 (the maximum).

              AccessAlternateDirectly -> (boolean)
                 Set this attribute to false in order to use the Binary Reader
                 to  capture  change  data for an Amazon RDS for Oracle as the
                 source. This tells the DMS instance to not access  redo  logs
                 through  any  specified  path prefix replacement using direct
                 file access.

              UseAlternateFolderForOnline -> (boolean)
                 Set this attribute to true in order to use the Binary  Reader
                 to  capture  change  data for an Amazon RDS for Oracle as the
                 source. This tells the DMS instance to use any specified pre-
                 fix replacement to access all online redo logs.

              OraclePathPrefix -> (string)
                 Set  this  string attribute to the required value in order to
                 use the Binary Reader to capture change data  for  an  Amazon
                 RDS  for  Oracle  as the source. This value specifies the de-
                 fault Oracle root used to access the redo logs.

              UsePathPrefix -> (string)
                 Set this string attribute to the required value in  order  to
                 use  the  Binary  Reader to capture change data for an Amazon
                 RDS for Oracle as the source. This value specifies  the  path
                 prefix  used to replace the default Oracle root to access the
                 redo logs.

              ReplacePathPrefix -> (boolean)
                 Set this attribute to true in order to use the Binary  Reader
                 to  capture  change  data for an Amazon RDS for Oracle as the
                 source. This setting tells DMS instance to  replace  the  de-
                 fault Oracle root with the specified usePathPrefix setting to
                 access the redo logs.

              EnableHomogenousTablespace -> (boolean)
                 Set this attribute to enable homogenous  tablespace  replica-
                 tion and create existing tables or indexes under the same ta-
                 blespace on the target.

              DirectPathNoLog -> (boolean)
                 When set to true , this attribute helps to increase the  com-
                 mit rate on the Oracle target database by writing directly to
                 tables and not writing a trail to database logs.

              ArchivedLogsOnly -> (boolean)
                 When this field is set to Y , DMS only accesses the  archived
                 redo logs. If the archived redo logs are stored on Oracle ASM
                 only, the DMS user account needs to  be  granted  ASM  privi-
                 leges.

              AsmPassword -> (string)
                 For  an Oracle source endpoint, your Oracle Automatic Storage
                 Management (ASM) password. You can set this value from the ``
                 asm_user_password `` value. You set this value as part of the
                 comma-separated value that you set to  the  Password  request
                 parameter  when you create the endpoint to access transaction
                 logs  using  Binary  Reader.  For   more   information,   see
                 Configuration  for  change  data  capture  (CDC) on an Oracle
                 source database .

              AsmServer -> (string)
                 For an Oracle source endpoint, your ASM server  address.  You
                 can  set  this  value  from  the  asm_server  value.  You set
                 asm_server as part of the extra connection  attribute  string
                 to  access an Oracle server with Binary Reader that uses ASM.
                 For more information, see Configuration for change data  cap-
                 ture (CDC) on an Oracle source database .

              AsmUser -> (string)
                 For  an  Oracle  source endpoint, your ASM user name. You can
                 set this value from the asm_user value. You set  asm_user  as
                 part  of  the  extra connection attribute string to access an
                 Oracle server with Binary Reader that uses ASM. For more  in-
                 formation, see Configuration for change data capture (CDC) on
                 an Oracle source database .

              CharLengthSemantics -> (string)
                 Specifies whether the length of  a  character  column  is  in
                 bytes or in characters. To indicate that the character column
                 length is in characters, set this attribute to CHAR .  Other-
                 wise, the character column length is in bytes.

                 Example: charLengthSemantics=CHAR;

              DatabaseName -> (string)
                 Database name for the endpoint.

              DirectPathParallelLoad -> (boolean)
                 When  set  to true , this attribute specifies a parallel load
                 when useDirectPathFullLoad is set to Y . This attribute  also
                 only applies when you use the DMS parallel load feature. Note
                 that the target table cannot have any constraints or indexes.

              FailTasksOnLobTruncation -> (boolean)
                 When set to true , this attribute causes a task  to  fail  if
                 the  actual  size of an LOB column is greater than the speci-
                 fied LobMaxSize .

                 If a task is set to limited LOB mode and this option  is  set
                 to true , the task fails instead of truncating the LOB data.

              NumberDatatypeScale -> (integer)
                 Specifies  the number scale. You can select a scale up to 38,
                 or you can select FLOAT. By default, the NUMBER data type  is
                 converted to precision 38, scale 10.

                 Example: numberDataTypeScale=12

              Password -> (string)
                 Endpoint connection password.

              Port -> (integer)
                 Endpoint TCP port.

              ReadTableSpaceName -> (boolean)
                 When  set to true , this attribute supports tablespace repli-
                 cation.

              RetryInterval -> (integer)
                 Specifies the number of seconds that the system waits  before
                 resending a query.

                 Example: retryInterval=6;

              SecurityDbEncryption -> (string)
                 For  an  Oracle source endpoint, the transparent data encryp-
                 tion (TDE) password required by AWM DMS to access Oracle redo
                 logs  encrypted by TDE using Binary Reader. It is also the ``
                 TDE_Password `` part of the comma-separated value you set  to
                 the  Password request parameter when you create the endpoint.
                 The SecurityDbEncryptian setting is related to this Security-
                 DbEncryptionName setting. For more information, see Supported
                 encryption methods for using Oracle as a source  for  DMS  in
                 the Database Migration Service User Guide .

              SecurityDbEncryptionName -> (string)
                 For an Oracle source endpoint, the name of a key used for the
                 transparent data encryption (TDE)  of  the  columns  and  ta-
                 blespaces  in an Oracle source database that is encrypted us-
                 ing TDE. The key value is the value of the  SecurityDbEncryp-
                 tion  setting.  For  more information on setting the key name
                 value of SecurityDbEncryptionName , see the  information  and
                 example  for  setting the securityDbEncryptionName extra con-
                 nection attribute in Supported encryption methods  for  using
                 Oracle  as a source for DMS in the Database Migration Service
                 User Guide .

              ServerName -> (string)
                 Fully qualified domain name of the endpoint.

              SpatialDataOptionToGeoJsonFunctionName -> (string)
                 Use this attribute to convert SDO_GEOMETRY to GEOJSON format.
                 By  default,  DMS  calls  the  SDO2GEOJSON custom function if
                 present and accessible. Or you can  create  your  own  custom
                 function that mimics the operation of SDOGEOJSON and set Spa-
                 tialDataOptionToGeoJsonFunctionName to call it instead.

              StandbyDelayTime -> (integer)
                 Use this attribute to specify a time in minutes for the delay
                 in standby sync. If the source is an Oracle Active Data Guard
                 standby database, use this attribute to specify the time  lag
                 between primary and standby databases.

                 In DMS, you can create an Oracle CDC task that uses an Active
                 Data Guard standby instance as a source for replicating ongo-
                 ing  changes. Doing this eliminates the need to connect to an
                 active database that might be in production.

              Username -> (string)
                 Endpoint connection user name.

              UseBFile -> (boolean)
                 Set this attribute to Y to capture change data using the  Bi-
                 nary  Reader  utility. Set UseLogminerReader to N to set this
                 attribute to Y. To use Binary Reader with Amazon RDS for Ora-
                 cle  as  the  source, you set additional attributes. For more
                 information about using this setting  with  Oracle  Automatic
                 Storage  Management  (ASM),  see Using Oracle LogMiner or DMS
                 Binary Reader for CDC .

              UseDirectPathFullLoad -> (boolean)
                 Set this attribute to Y to have DMS use a  direct  path  full
                 load.  Specify  this value to use the direct path protocol in
                 the Oracle Call Interface (OCI). By using this OCI  protocol,
                 you can bulk-load Oracle target tables during a full load.

              UseLogminerReader -> (boolean)
                 Set this attribute to Y to capture change data using the Ora-
                 cle LogMiner utility (the default). Set this attribute  to  N
                 if  you  want  to access the redo logs as a binary file. When
                 you set UseLogminerReader to N, also set UseBfile to  Y.  For
                 more  information  on  this setting and using Oracle ASM, see
                 Using Oracle LogMiner or DMS Binary Reader for CDC in the DMS
                 User Guide .

              SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  full  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the IAM role that
                 specifies DMS as the trusted entity and grants  the  required
                 permissions to access the value in SecretsManagerSecret . The
                 role must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret
                 has  the value of the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager se-
                 cret that allows access to the Oracle endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     You can specify one of two sets of values for these  per-
                     missions. You can specify the values for this setting and
                     SecretsManagerSecretId . Or you  can  specify  clear-text
                     values  for UserName , Password , ServerName , and Port .
                     You can't specify both. For more information on  creating
                     this  SecretsManagerSecret  and the SecretsManagerAccess-
                     RoleArn and SecretsManagerSecretId required to access it,
                     see  Using  secrets  to access Database Migration Service
                     resources in the Database Migration Service User Guide .

              SecretsManagerSecretId -> (string)
                 The full ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of  the  Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret  that  contains  the Oracle endpoint connection
                 details.

              SecretsManagerOracleAsmAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 Required only if your Oracle endpoint uses  Advanced  Storage
                 Manager  (ASM).  The  full ARN of the IAM role that specifies
                 DMS as the trusted entity and grants the required permissions
                 to  access  the SecretsManagerOracleAsmSecret . This Secrets-
                 ManagerOracleAsmSecret has the secret value that  allows  ac-
                 cess to the Oracle ASM of the endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     You  can specify one of two sets of values for these per-
                     missions. You can specify the values for this setting and
                     SecretsManagerOracleAsmSecretId  .  Or  you  can  specify
                     clear-text values for AsmUserName  ,  AsmPassword  ,  and
                     AsmServerName . You can't specify both. For more informa-

                     secrets to access Database Migration Service resources in
                     the Database Migration Service User Guide .

              SecretsManagerOracleAsmSecretId -> (string)
                 Required only if your Oracle endpoint uses  Advanced  Storage
                 Manager (ASM). The full ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of
                 the SecretsManagerOracleAsmSecret that  contains  the  Oracle
                 ASM connection details for the Oracle endpoint.

              TrimSpaceInChar -> (boolean)
                 Use  the TrimSpaceInChar source endpoint setting to trim data
                 on CHAR and NCHAR data types during  migration.  The  default
                 value is true .

          SybaseSettings -> (structure)
              The  settings  for  the  SAP ASE source and target endpoint. For
              more information, see the SybaseSettings structure.

              SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  IAM  role  that
                 specifies  DMS  as the trusted entity and grants the required
                 permissions to access the value in SecretsManagerSecret . The
                 role must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret
                 has the value of the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager  se-
                 cret that allows access to the SAP ASE endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     You  can specify one of two sets of values for these per-
                     missions. You can specify the values for this setting and
                     SecretsManagerSecretId  .  Or  you can specify clear-text
                     values for UserName , Password , ServerName , and Port  .
                     You  can't specify both. For more information on creating
                     this SecretsManagerSecret and  the  SecretsManagerAccess-
                     RoleArn and SecretsManagerSecretId required to access it,
                     see Using secrets to access  Database  Migration  Service
                     resources in the Database Migration Service User Guide .

                 The  full  ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of the Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret that contains the SAP SAE  endpoint  connection
                 details.

          MicrosoftSQLServerSettings -> (structure)
              The settings for the Microsoft SQL Server source and target end-
              point. For more information, see the  MicrosoftSQLServerSettings
              structure.

                 Database name for the endpoint.

              ControlTablesFileGroup -> (string)
                 Specifies a file group for the DMS internal tables. When  the
                 replication  task starts, all the internal DMS control tables
                 (
                 awsdms_
                  apply_exception, awsdms_apply, awsdms_changes)  are  created
                 for the specified file group.

              Password -> (string)
                 Endpoint connection password.

              QuerySingleAlwaysOnNode -> (boolean)
                 Cleans and recreates table metadata information on the repli-
                 cation instance when a mismatch occurs. An example is a situ-
                 ation  where  running an alter DDL statement on a table might
                 result in different information about the table cached in the
                 replication instance.

              ReadBackupOnly -> (boolean)
                 When this attribute is set to Y , DMS only reads changes from
                 transaction log backups and  doesn't  read  from  the  active
                 transaction log file during ongoing replication. Setting this
                 parameter to Y enables you to control active transaction  log
                 file  growth  during full load and ongoing replication tasks.
                 However, it can add some source latency to  ongoing  replica-
                 tion.

              SafeguardPolicy -> (string)
                 Use  this attribute to minimize the need to access the backup
                 log and enable DMS to prevent truncation  using  one  of  the
                 following two methods.
                     Start  transactions  in the database: This is the default
                     method. When this method is used, DMS prevents TLOG trun-
                     cation  by  mimicking  a  transaction in the database. As
                     long as such a transaction is open, changes  that  appear
                     after  the  transaction  started aren't truncated. If you
                     need Microsoft Replication to be enabled  in  your  data-
                     base, then you must choose this method.

                     Exclusively  use  sp_repldone within a single task : When
                     this method is used, DMS reads the changes and then  uses
                     sp_repldone  to  mark  the TLOG transactions as ready for
                     truncation. Although  this  method  doesn't  involve  any
                     transactional activities, it can only be used when Micro-
                     soft Replication isn't running.  Also,  when  using  this
                     method,  only one DMS task can access the database at any
                     given time. Therefore, if you need to  run  parallel  DMS
                     tasks against the same database, use the default method.

              ServerName -> (string)
                 Fully qualified domain name of the endpoint.

              Username -> (string)
                 Endpoint connection user name.

              UseBcpFullLoad -> (boolean)
                 Use  this  to attribute to transfer data for full-load opera-
                 tions using BCP. When the target table contains  an  identity
                 column that does not exist in the source table, you must dis-
                 able the use BCP for loading table option.

              UseThirdPartyBackupDevice -> (boolean)
                 When this attribute is set to Y , DMS  processes  third-party
                 transaction log backups if they are created in native format.

              SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  full  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the IAM role that
                 specifies DMS as the trusted entity and grants  the  required
                 permissions to access the value in SecretsManagerSecret . The
                 role must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret
                 has  the value of the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager se-
                 cret that allows access to the SQL Server endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     You can specify one of two sets of values for these  per-
                     missions. You can specify the values for this setting and
                     SecretsManagerSecretId . Or you  can  specify  clear-text
                     values  for UserName , Password , ServerName , and Port .
                     You can't specify both. For more information on  creating

                 tion details.

              TrimSpaceInChar -> (boolean)
                 Use the TrimSpaceInChar source endpoint setting to trim  data
                 on  CHAR  and  NCHAR data types during migration. The default
                 value is true .

          IBMDb2Settings -> (structure)
              The settings for the IBM Db2 LUW source endpoint. For  more  in-
              formation, see the IBMDb2Settings structure.

                 has  the value of the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager se-
                 cret that allows access to the Db2 LUW endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     You can specify one of two sets of values for these  per-
                     missions. You can specify the values for this setting and
                     SecretsManagerSecretId . Or you  can  specify  clear-text
                     values  for UserName , Password , ServerName , and Port .
                     You can't specify both. For more information on  creating
                     this  SecretsManagerSecret  and the SecretsManagerAccess-

                     see  Using  secrets  to access Database Migration Service
                     resources in the Database Migration Service User Guide .

              SecretsManagerSecretId -> (string)
                 The full ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of  the  Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret  that  contains the Db2 LUW endpoint connection
                 details.

          DocDbSettings -> (structure)
              Provides information that defines a DocumentDB endpoint.

              Username -> (string)
                 The user name you use to access the  DocumentDB  source  end-
                 point.

                 the replication instance. If you don't specify  a  value  for
                 the KmsKeyId parameter, then DMS uses your default encryption
                 key. KMS creates the default encryption key for  your  Amazon
                 Web  Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a
                 different default encryption key for each Amazon Web Services
                 Region.

              SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  full  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the IAM role that
                 specifies DMS as the trusted entity and grants  the  required
                 permissions to access the value in SecretsManagerSecret . The
                 role must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret
                 has  the value of the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager se-
                 cret that allows access to the DocumentDB endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     You can specify one of two sets of values for these  per-
                     missions. You can specify the values for this setting and
                     SecretsManagerSecretId . Or you  can  specify  clear-text
                     values  for UserName , Password , ServerName , and Port .
                     You can't specify both. For more information on  creating
                     this  SecretsManagerSecret  and the SecretsManagerAccess-
                     RoleArn and SecretsManagerSecretId required to access it,
                     see  Using  secrets  to access Database Migration Service
                     resources in the Database Migration Service User Guide .

                 The full ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of  the  Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret  that  contains the DocumentDB endpoint connec-
                 tion details.

          RedisSettings -> (structure)
              The settings for the Redis target endpoint.  For  more  informa-
              tion, see the RedisSettings structure.

              ServerName -> (string)
                 Fully qualified domain name of the endpoint.

              Port -> (integer)

              SslSecurityProtocol -> (string)
                 The  connection  to  a  Redis target endpoint using Transport
                 Layer Security (TLS).  Valid  values  include  plaintext  and
                 ssl-encryption  . The default is ssl-encryption . The ssl-en-
                 cryption option makes an  encrypted  connection.  Optionally,
                 you  can  identify  an  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an SSL
                 certificate authority (CA) using the SslCaCertificateArn set-
                 ting.  If  an  ARN  isn't given for a CA, DMS uses the Amazon
                 root CA.

                 The plaintext option doesn't provide Transport Layer Security
                 (TLS) encryption for traffic between endpoint and database.

              AuthType -> (string)
                 The  type  of  authentication to perform when connecting to a
                 Redis  target.  Options  include  none  ,  auth-token  ,  and
                 auth-role  .  The  auth-token option requires an AuthPassword
                 value to be provided. The auth-role option requires AuthUser-
                 Name and AuthPassword values to be provided.

              AuthUserName -> (string)
                 The  user  name provided with the auth-role option of the Au-
                 thType setting for a Redis target endpoint.

              AuthPassword -> (string)
                 The password provided with the auth-role and  auth-token  op-
                 tions of the AuthType setting for a Redis target endpoint.

              SslCaCertificateArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the certificate authority
                 (CA) that DMS uses to connect to your Redis target endpoint.

          GcpMySQLSettings -> (structure)
              Settings in JSON format for the source GCP MySQL endpoint.

              AfterConnectScript -> (string)
                 Specifies a script to run immediately after DMS  connects  to
                 the endpoint. The migration task continues running regardless
                 if the SQL statement succeeds or fails.

                 For this parameter, provide the code of  the  script  itself,
                 not the name of a file containing the script.

              CleanSourceMetadataOnMismatch -> (boolean)
                 Adjusts the behavior of DMS when migrating from an SQL Server
                 source database that is hosted as part of an Always On avail-
                 ability  group cluster. If you need DMS to poll all the nodes
                 in the Always On cluster for transaction  backups,  set  this
                 attribute to false .

              DatabaseName -> (string)
                 Database  name for the endpoint. For a MySQL source or target
                 endpoint, don't explicitly specify  the  database  using  the
                 DatabaseName  request  parameter on either the CreateEndpoint
                 or ModifyEndpoint API call. Specifying DatabaseName when  you
                 create or modify a MySQL endpoint replicates all the task ta-
                 bles to this single database. For MySQL endpoints, you  spec-
                 ify  the database only when you specify the schema in the ta-
                 ble-mapping rules of the DMS task.

              EventsPollInterval -> (integer)
                 Specifies  how  often  to  check  the  binary  log  for   new
                 changes/events when the database is idle. The default is five
                 seconds.

                 Example: eventsPollInterval=5;

                 In the example, DMS checks for changes in the binary logs ev-
                 ery five seconds.

              TargetDbType -> (string)
                 Specifies  where  to migrate source tables on the target, ei-
                 ther to a single database or multiple databases.

                 Example: targetDbType=MULTIPLE_DATABASES

              MaxFileSize -> (integer)
                 Specifies the maximum size (in KB) of any .csv file  used  to
                 transfer data to a MySQL-compatible database.

                 Example: maxFileSize=512

              ParallelLoadThreads -> (integer)
                 Improves performance when loading data into the MySQL-compat-
                 ible target database. Specifies how many threads  to  use  to
                 load the data into the MySQL-compatible target database. Set-
                 ting a large number of threads can have an adverse effect  on
                 database  performance,  because  a separate connection is re-
                 quired for each thread. The default is one.

                 Example: parallelLoadThreads=1

              Password -> (string)
                 Endpoint connection password.

              Port -> (integer)

              ServerName -> (string)
                 Endpoint TCP port.

              ServerTimezone -> (string)
                 Specifies the time zone for the source MySQL database.

                 Example: serverTimezone=US/Pacific;

                 Note: Do not enclose time zones in single quotes.

              Username -> (string)
                 Endpoint connection user name.

              SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  IAM  role  that
                 specifies  DMS  as the trusted entity and grants the required
                 permissions to access the value in SecretsManagerSecret.  The
                 role must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret
                 has the value of the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager  se-
                 cret that allows access to the MySQL endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     You  can specify one of two sets of values for these per-
                     missions. You can specify the values for this setting and
                     SecretsManagerSecretId  .  Or  you can specify clear-text
                     values for UserName , Password , ServerName , and Port  .
                     You  can't specify both. For more information on creating
                     this SecretsManagerSecret and  the  SecretsManagerAccess-
                     RoleArn and SecretsManagerSecretId required to access it,
                     see Using secrets to access  Database  Migration  Service
                     resources in the Database Migration Service User Guide.

              SecretsManagerSecretId -> (string)
                 The  full  ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of the Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret that contains the MySQL endpoint connection de-
