CREATE-REPLICATION-SUBNET-GROUP()            CREATE-REPLICATION-SUBNET-GROUP()



NAME
       create-replication-subnet-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a replication subnet group given a list of the subnet IDs in a
       VPC.

       The VPC needs to have at least one subnet in at least two  availability
       zones  in  the  Amazon  Web Services Region, otherwise the service will
       throw a ReplicationSubnetGroupDoesNotCoverEnoughAZs exception.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-replication-subnet-group
          --replication-subnet-group-identifier <value>
          --replication-subnet-group-description <value>
          --subnet-ids <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --replication-subnet-group-identifier (string)
          The name for the replication subnet group. This value is stored as a
          lowercase string.

          Constraints:  Must contain no more than 255 alphanumeric characters,
          periods, spaces, underscores, or hyphens. Must not be "default".

          Example: mySubnetgroup

       --replication-subnet-group-description (string)
          The description for the subnet group.

       --subnet-ids (list)
          One or more subnet IDs to be assigned to the subnet group.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          One or more tags to be assigned to the subnet group.

          (structure)
              A user-defined key-value pair that describes metadata  added  to
              an  DMS resource and that is used by operations such as the fol-
              lowing:

              o AddTagsToResource

              o ListTagsForResource

              o RemoveTagsFromResource

              Key -> (string)
                 A key is the required name of the tag. The string  value  can
                 be  1-128  Unicode characters in length and can't be prefixed
                 with "aws:" or "dms:". The string can only contain  only  the
                 set  of  Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.', '/',
                 '=',     '+',     '-'     (Java     regular      expressions:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  is  the optional value of the tag. The string value
                 can be 1-256 Unicode characters in length and can't  be  pre-
                 fixed with "aws:" or "dms:". The string can only contain only
                 the set of Unicode letters, digits,  white-space,  '_',  '.',
                 '/',    '=',    '+',    '-'    (Java   regular   expressions:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) string that  uniquely  identi-
                 fies the resource for which the tag is created.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,ResourceArn=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "ResourceArn": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a subnet group

       The  following  create-replication-subnet-group example creates a group
       consisting of 3 subnets.

          aws dms create-replication-subnet-group \
              --replication-subnet-group-identifier my-subnet-group \
              --replication-subnet-group-description "my subnet group" \
              --subnet-ids subnet-da327bf6 subnet-bac383e0 subnet-d7c825e8

       Output:

                          "SubnetStatus": "Active"

                          "SubnetAvailabilityZone": {
                              "Name": "us-east-1e"
                          },
